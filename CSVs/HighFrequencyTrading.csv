Since its listing, the market, grown unceasingly in scale and internationalization level, has become the largest copper futures trading market in the world (the London Metal Exchange (LME) copper futures market is the second largest). Using the data from 2006 to 2022 as a sample, a period covering the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the internationalization of the Chinese copper futures, this paper analyzes the market efficiency of China's copper futures based on both intertemporal and intermarket strategies (SHFE Copper Futures and LME Copper Futures, with considering time difference factor). To better reflect the actual situation, this paper, when establishing trading strategy models, not only took into account various actual trading factors such as transaction costs, market impact costs, liquidity costs, margin, and capital costs but also combined daily and high-frequency data to present highly practical arbitrage strategies. According to empirical results, overall, it was not found significant arbitrage opportunities to violate the market efficiency rule. Although some arbitrage opportunities indeed emerged, they were infrequent, especially when transaction costs were considered. Specifically, in terms of the intertemporal strategy, despite that infrequent arbitrage opportunities did appear in the SHFE copper futures market, they failed to bring substantial gains, some of which even caused losses in extreme cases. In terms of the intermarket strategy, there is a cointegration relationship between the logarithmic price of LME copper futures and the logarithmic price of SHFE copper futures. The average annualized rates of return in the results of the in-sample empirical analysis were high, but in the out-of-sample empirical analysis of high frequency and daily data were not found significant arbitrage opportunities. The influence between the LME copper futures market and the SHFE copper futures market was bidirectional. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

Significant improvements in stock price prediction methods based on deep learning have been observed in recent years. However, most existing methods are reliant solely on historical stock price data for predictions, resulting in the inability to capture market dynamics beyond price indicators, thus limiting their performance to some extent. Therefore, combining social media text with historical stock price information has proposed a novel stock price prediction method, known as the Deep Cross-Modal Information Fusion Network (DCIFNet). The process is initiated by DCIFNet, which employs temporal convolution processes to encode stock prices and Twitter content. This ensures that each element has sufficient information about its surrounding components. Following this, the outcomes are inputted into a cross-modal fusion structure based on transformers to enhance the integration of crucial information from stock prices and Twitter content. Lastly, a multi-graph convolution attention network is introduced to depict the relationships between different stocks from diverse perspectives. This facilitates the more effective capturing of industry affiliations, Wikipedia references, and associated relationships among linked stocks, ultimately leading to an enhancement in stock price prediction accuracy. Trend prediction and simulated trading experiments are conducted on high-frequency trading datasets spanning nine different industries. Comparative assessments with the Multi-Attention Network for Stock Prediction (MANGSF) method, as well as ablation experiments, confirm the effectiveness of the DCIFNet approach, resulting in an accuracy rate of 0.6309, a marked improvement compared to representative methods in the field.  © 2024 World Scientific Publishing Company."

The results are robust to the use of various adjusted measures of high-moment risk, their subcomponents, various measures of trading activity, and data attributes. This study suggests that realized high moments are a market risk and cannot be combined with volatility risk and other risk measures.

The limit order book contains all buy and sell orders placed by investors, updated in real-time, for the most liquid securities, even several hundred times a minute. Due to its irregular nature (different and dynamic changes in the number of buy and sell orders), direct calculations on the order book data are not feasible without transforming it into feature vectors. Currently, most studies use a price level-based data representation scheme when applying deep learning models on limit order book data. However, this scheme has limitations, particularly its sensitivity to subtle perturbations that can negatively impact model performance. On the other hand, the ordered fuzzy number is a mathematical object (a pair of two functions) used to process imprecise and uncertain data. Ordered Fuzzy Numbers possess well-defined arithmetic properties. Converting the limit order book data to ordered fuzzy numbers allows the creation of a time series of ordered fuzzy numbers (order books) and use them for further calculations, e.g., to represent input data for deep learning models or employing the concept of fuzzy time series in various domains, such as defining liquidity measures based on limit order book data. In this paper, the proposed approach is tested using one-year market data from the Polish Stock Exchange for the five biggest companies. The DeepLOB model is employed to predict mid-price movement using different input data representations. The proposed representation of Limit Order Book data demonstrated remarkably stable out-of-sample prediction accuracy, even when subjected to data perturbation. © 2024 The Author(s)"

This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) within the double DQN algorithm. Traditional reward functions in algorithmic trading heavily rely on expert knowledge, posing challenges in their design and implementation. To tackle this, the reward-driven double DQN (R-DDQN) algorithm is proposed, integrating human feedback via a reward function network trained on expert demonstrations. Additionally, a classification-based training method is employed for optimizing the reward function network.

This study delves into the phenomenon of price bubbles within six major ETSs globally: the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (NZ ETS), the California-Québec Emissions Trading Scheme (CQ ETS), the South Korea Emissions Trading Schemes (K-ETS), the China Emissions Trading Scheme (C-ETS), and the United Kingdom Emissions Trading Schemes (UK ETS). Employing the sup augmented Dickey-Fuller (SADF) test, generalized sup ADF (GSADF) test, and log-periodic power law singularity (LPPLS) model, our analysis aims to uncover the dynamics and implications of these bubbles. Our findings reveal varied patterns of price bubbles across the schemes, with the EU ETS showing the highest frequency and the NZ ETS exhibiting the longest durations. The period of 2021 and 2022 marked a significant increase in bubble occurrences across all ETSs, suggesting the influence of post-COVID-19 economic recovery and geopolitical tensions on market stability. These bubbles are attributed to factors including carbon market policies, macroeconomic conditions, energy price fluctuations, and market uncertainties. The study offers valuable insights for compliance firms, policymakers, and investors on navigating carbon market volatility. Understanding bubble dynamics can aid in formulating more effective emission reduction strategies, carbon pricing policies, and investment decisions.

First, we map price levels of stocks directly to external DRAM addresses, which naturally solve sorting issues within one DRAM access. Second, we customize a novel two-level CACHE to manage the best bids and offers in real-time to reduce the latency of snapshot generating. In the experiment, the latency of the FPGA solution ranges from 26 to 209 ns, which is 3.5 to 37.6 times faster than the software solution.

In this paper we propose a Bayesian hierarchical framework that in-corporates correlated latent level and temporal effects to model multivariate count data during intraday transaction intervals. Built on the INLA method for implementation, our framework proves to be competitive with the traditional MCMC approach in terms of model inference and computational cost. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methodology by applying it to assets from three Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) sectors, namely, health-care, energy, and industrials. The analysis uncovers various microstructures of financial count data using our framework. Specifically, our model featuring a correlated latent effect structure adeptly captures the pattern of the empirical correlations within the count data patterns with additional statistical inference, such as assessing different associations between short-term averaged trading size as well as trading duration, the counts at different risk levels, and uncovering differential levels of uncertainty resulted from market temporal behavior and unobservable latent effects across the three sectors. We also discuss some potential applications of our framework in real-world scenarios. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2024."

The accurate prediction of the carbon price in this market is crucial for the government to formulate scientific policies regarding the carbon market and for companies to participate effectively. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to accurately predict price fluctuations in the carbon market because of the volatility and instability caused by several complex factors. This paper proposes a new carbon price forecasting framework that considers the potential factors influencing national carbon prices, including data decomposition and reconstruction techniques, feature selection techniques, machine learning forecasting techniques for intelligent optimisation, and research on model interpretability. This comprehensive framework aims to improve the accuracy and understandability of carbon price projections to respond better to the complexity and uncertainty of carbon markets. The results indicate that (1) the hybrid forecasting framework is highly accurate in forecasting national carbon market prices and far superior to other comparative models; (2) the factors driving national carbon prices vary according to the time scale. High-frequency series are sensitive to short-term economic and energy market indicators. Medium- and low-frequency series are more susceptible to financial markets and long-term economic conditions than high-frequency series.

First of all, the original sequence of carbon prices is decomposed into multiple independent subsequences through the completely ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) technique. The sample entropy values of each subsequence are calculated to reconstruct them as high-frequency, low-frequency, and trend sequences. Second, we employ the variational mode decomposition (VMD) approach to decompose the high-frequency series. The obtained subsequences, along with the low-frequency and trend sequences, are separately input into an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) optimized bidirectional long short-term memory neural network (BiLSTM) model for forecasting.

However, transaction performance and scalability has become the main challenges hindering the widespread adoption of blockchain. Due to its inability to meet the demands of high-frequency trading, blockchain cannot be adopted in many scenarios. To improve the transaction capacity, researchers have proposed some on-chain scaling technologies, including lightning networks, directed acyclic graph technology, state channels, and sharding mechanisms, in which sharding emerges as a potential scaling technology. Nevertheless, excessive cross-shard transactions and uneven shard workloads prevent the sharding mechanism from achieving the expected aim. This paper proposes a graph-based sharding scheme for public blockchain to efficiently balance the transaction distribution. By mitigating cross-shard transactions and evening-out workloads among shards, the scheme reduces transaction confirmation latency and enhances the transaction capacity of the blockchain. Therefore, the scheme can achieve a high-frequency transaction as well as a better blockchain scalability. Experiments results show that the scheme effectively reduces the cross-shard transaction ratio to a range of 35%–56% and significantly decreases the transaction confirmation latency to 6 s in a blockchain with no more than 25 shards. © 2024 Tech Science Press.

To address this problem, this paper proposes a new methodology for optimal sampling period selection, which better adapts to heavy-tailed statistics of high-frequency financial data. In particular, the novel concept of the degree of impulsiveness (DoI) is introduced first based on alpha-stable distributions, as an alternative source of information for characterising a broad range of impulsive behaviours. Then, a DoI-based generalised volatility signature plot is defined, which is further employed for determining the optimal sampling period.

On this basis, this study proposes an improved decomposition–reconstruction framework and constructs a novel hybrid forecasting model Informer-DA-BOHB-TVFEMD-CL. The hybrid model decomposes carbon price by TVFEMD to obtain different volatility characteristics and classifies these features by time series clustering, where the high-frequency components are retained and the low-frequency components are reconstructed. Then, the training set was expanded by the generative data augment technique to improve the model's generalization ability and avoid overfitting. Finally, the advanced deep learning model Informer and the hyperparameter optimization technique BOHB are used to model the training set, and the prediction results of each subcomponent are integrated to obtain the final prediction results. Experiments are conducted in EU-ETS, Guangdong, Hubei, and Chinese national carbon market.

First, the top 10 foreigners in transaction value shifted from intensively investing in blue-chip stocks to diversifying investments in multiple stocks. Second, foreigners who trade more than 1,000 stocks a day on average have become a new leading force. Third, as regulations on high frequency trading in the United States and Europe were strengthened, foreigners are moving to Asia for regulation arbitrage.

The analysis shows that current period volatility influences position exits in the subsequent period and vice-versa. The analysis further shows that for the same price movement, position exits are lowered under stronger APC margin. The effect is weaker for participants having variation losses, where limiting losses may be an additional incentive to exit positions in addition to rise in initial margins. The findings support the argument that better APC characteristics of CCP margins can attenuate volatility. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC."

The existing STP approaches only use market data with the same granularity (e.g., as daily market data). However, in the actual financial investment, there are a large number of more detailed investment signals contained in finer-grained data (e.g., high-frequency data). This motivates us to research how to leverage multi-granularity market data to capture more useful information and improve the accuracy in the task of STP. However, the effective utilization of multi-granularity data presents a major challenge. Firstly, the iteration of multi-granularity data with time will lead to more complex noise, which is difficult to extract signals. Secondly, the difference in granularity may lead to opposite target trends in the same time interval. Thirdly, the target trends of stocks with similar features can be quite different, and different sizes of granularity will aggravate this gap. In order to address these challenges, we present a self-supervised framework of multi-granularity denoising contrastive learning (MDC). Specifically, we construct a dynamic dictionary of memory, which can obtain clear and unified representations by filtering noise and aligning multi-granularity data. Moreover, we design two contrast learning modules during the fine-tuning stage to solve the differences in trends by constructing additional self-supervised signals. Besides, in the pre-training stage, we design the granularity domain adaptation module (GDA) to address the issues of temporal inconsistency and data imbalance associated with different granularity in financial data, alongside the memory self-distillation module (MSD) to tackle the challenge posed by a low signal-to-noise ratio. The GDA alleviates these complications by replacing a portion of the coarse-grained data with the preceding time step’s fine-grained data, while the MSD seeks to filter out intrinsic noise by aligning the fine-grained representations with the coarse-grained representations’ distribution using a self-distillation mechanism. Extensive experiments on the CSI 300 and CSI 100 datasets show that our framework stands out from the existing top-level systems and has excellent profitability in real investing scenarios. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2023."

PR refers to the process of adjusting the relative weight of assets within portfolios at regular time intervals, whereas TR is a process of setting allocation limits for portfolios and rebalancing when portfolios exceed a specific percentage of deviation from the target allocation. The HFRA is constructed as an integration of pairs trading and a threshold-based rebalancing strategy, and the profitability of the HFRA is examined to determine the optimal portfolio size. The HFRA is applied to a dataset of real price series from cryptocurrency exchange markets across various trends and volatility regimes. Using cointegrated price data, it is shown that increasing the number of assets in a portfolio supports the profitability of the HFRA in an up-trend and reduces the potential loss of the HFRA in a down-trend in a high-volatility environment. For low-volatility regimes, although increasing portfolio size marginally enhances the HFRA’s profitability, the profits of portfolios of varied sizes do not significantly differ. It is demonstrated that when volatility is relatively high and the trend is upward, the HFRA can yield a substantial return via portfolios of large sizes. Moreover, the profitability of the HFRA is compared with that of the PR and TR strategies for long-term application. The HFRA is more profitable than the PR and TR strategies. This achievement of the HFRA is also validated statistically using the Fisher–Pitman permutation test. © The Author(s) 2024."

Accurate monitoring of emissions in these enterprises is crucial for ensuring fair and trusted carbon trading. However, traditional monitoring methods have encountered various challenges including poor accuracy, low frequency, significant hysteresis and weak credibility. Addressing these concerns, this paper introduces a novel, multi-trusted, high-frequency monitoring approach for the measurement of both direct and indirect carbon emissions of enterprises, utilizing externally available multi-source big data, vertical federated long short-term memory network with a self-attention mechanism (VF-LSTMSA) and additive homomorphic encryption. The efficacy of this model is thoroughly assessed via case studies on six hourly datasets from the power and steel sectors. Our principal findings include: (1) In the current scenario, the proposed VF-LSTMSA model demonstrates superior federated efficiency, improving with the inclusion of more federated participants. (2) The VF-LSTMSA model surpasses other prevalent AI models, achieving a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of less than 9% across power and steel datasets. (3) The advanced high-frequency carbon emission monitoring method exhibits errors of +0.28%, +1.29%, and −0.41% in the current scenario monitoring task, suggesting that the model effectively leverages multi-source externally available big data to precisely monitor the target enterprise's carbon emissions while safeguarding multi-party data security.

Two trading strategies commonly employed by high-frequency traders, spoofing (SP) - associated with market manipulation - and market making (MM) - seen as liquidity provision - are considered. These experiments reveal that, first, the mere expectation of SP traders can, at first, impair price convergence towards fundamentals. Second, the expected presence of AT, especially MM traders, induce larger initial price forecasts deviations from fundamentals. Third, despite the absence of AT in our experiments, the information about the presence of AT, employing MM strategy, is sufficient to alter subjects trading behavior over time and the impact of past realized prices on subjects’ order prices. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

Although the spread cannot be precisely estimated because of microstructure noise, the QV of the price series, consisting of the transaction prices and midquotes (an expanded filtration of transaction prices), in limit order markets is an important property of high-frequency datasets. An empirical examination of a sample of stocks from the NASDAQ 100 is used to estimate and examine the QV. The examination is done at high resolution (subsecond timescale). The QV of our sample best fits a log-normal distribution with higher skewness. The QV of trades (29.73E–05) is distant from the QV measured with pretrade and posttrade price series, as they are characterized by a high range in QV. Similarly, the QV is generally lower with pretrades than posttrades. Using a high resolution, the revealed state of the limit order book presents a solution that reduced the impact cost of trading. The QV is higher with the limit order book (68.5E–05) than with trades. A measure called the limit-to-market order signal shows a consistent pattern of decline in stocks with increasing activity. The limit-to-market signal ranged from an average of 3.55 in the first quartile of stocks based on messages to 1.84 in the third quartile. This signal decreases because of a relatively larger decline in uncertainty in QV using the limit order book. © 2024 Borsa İstanbul Anonim Şirketi"

Reinforcement learning (RL) in financial research has shown stellar performance on many quantitative trading tasks. However, most methods focus on low-frequency trading, e.g., day-level, which cannot be directly applied to HFT because of two challenges. First, RL for HFT involves dealing with extremely long trajectories (e.g., 2.4 million steps per month), which is hard to optimize and evaluate. Second, the dramatic price fluctuations and market trend changes of Crypto make existing algorithms fail to maintain satisfactory performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose an Efficient hieArchical Reinforcement learNing method for High Frequency Trading (EarnHFT), a novel three-stage hierarchical RL framework for HFT. In stage I, we compute a Q-teacher, i.e., the optimal action-value based on dynamic programming, for enhancing the performance and training efficiency of second-level RL agents. In stage II, we construct a pool of diverse RL agents for different market trends, distinguished by return rates, where hundreds of RL agents are trained with different preferences of return rates and only a tiny fraction of them will be selected into the pool based on their profitability. In stage III, we train a minute-level router which dynamically picks a second-level agent from the pool to achieve stable performance across different markets. Through extensive experiments in various market trends on Crypto markets in a high-fidelity simulation trading environment, we demonstrate that EarnHFT significantly outperforms 6 state-of-art baselines in 3 popular financial criteria, exceeding the runner-up by 30% in profitability.

However, these works usually focus on point-valued crude oil closing prices which may suffer from information loss. Instead, this paper proposes a novel interval-based framework based on the principle of “divide and conquer”. After deploying variational mode decomposition (VMD) on an original training series to decompose it into low- and high-frequency components, a newly proposed autoregressive conditional interval (ACI) model is applied to predict the interval-valued low-frequency component which is treated as an inseparable random set, while the interval-valued high-frequency component is predicted by interval long short-term memory (iLSTM) networks. Combination of the two parts yields the final interval-valued prediction. A trading strategy for interval-valued data is designed and executed on a daily basis. Compared to benchmark models and competing trading strategies, the proposed framework can generate superior forecasts and deliver enhanced trading performances. The analysis within this study indicates that the framework's outstanding performance is robust to various forecasting horizons. © 2023"

This study answers the following research questions: What is the best sparse regression model to predict the next-minute price of BTC? What are the key drivers of the BTC price in high-frequency trading? Design/methodology/approach: Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and Ridge regressions are adopted using minute-based open-high-low-close prices, volume and trade count for eight major cryptos, global stock market indices, foreign currency pairs, crude oil and gold price information for February 2020–March 2021. This study also examines whether there was any significant break and how the accuracy of the selected models was impacted. Findings: Findings suggest that Ridge regression is the most effective model for predicting next-minute BTC prices based on BTC-related covariates such as BTC-open, BTC-high and BTC-low, with a moderate amount of regularization. While BTC-based covariates BTC-open and BTC-low were most significant in predicting BTC closing prices during stable periods, BTC-open and BTC-high were most important during volatile periods. Overall findings suggest that BTC’s price information is the most helpful to predict its next-minute closing price after considering various other asset classes’ price information. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first paper to identify the covariates of major cryptocurrencies and predict the next-minute BTC crypto price, with a focus on both crypto-asset and cross-market information. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."

The mWDN component captures short-term and long-term dependencies by decomposing the input time series into multiple scales, while the Transformer component adeptly models long-range dependencies and temporal relationships within the decomposed series. We evaluate the mWDN-Transformer model using a benchmark dataset from China stock market.

In contrast to an orderly point process, for which the probability of observing more than one event over a short time interval is negligible, the bursting intensity causes an extreme clustering of events around the singularity. We propose a nonparametric approach to detect such bursts in the intensity. It relies on a heavy traffic condition, which admits inference for point processes over a finite time interval. With Monte Carlo evidence, we show that our testing procedure exhibits size control under the null, whereas it has high rejection rates under the alternative. We implement our approach on high-frequency data for the EUR/USD spot exchange rate, where the test statistic captures abnormal surges in trading activity. We detect a nontrivial amount of intensity bursts in these data and describe their basic properties. Trading activity during an intensity burst is positively related to volatility, illiquidity, and the probability of observing a drift burst. The latter effect is reinforced if the order flow is imbalanced or the price elasticity of the limit order book is large. © 2024 The Author(s)"

Unlike previous studies, we examine a long-run series of high-frequency data on gas and oil prices from July 2007 to May 2022, which provides more than one million observations with which to analyze volatility. We compute realized volatility (RV) and decompose it into continuous volatility and jumps. We then investigate the relationship between uncertainty, investor sentiment, and RV, as well as its main components. Econometrically, we extend the heterogeneous autoregressive model of Corsi (2009) while considering not only disaggregate proxies for volatility (jumps and continuous volatility) and introducing uncertainty and heterogeneous investor sentiment, but also by allowing the model to include asymmetry, nonlinearity, and time variation according to the regime under consideration. Our results present three main findings. First, we find significant evidence of volatility decomposition, suggesting that both markets are characterized by significant jumps. Second, we show that trading volume, extra-financial news (uncertainty, investor sentiment), and jumps appear to drive commodity price volatility. Third, we find evidence of nonlinearity and threshold effects on energy price volatility. These findings are relevant for policymakers, regulators, investors, and portfolio managers, as they enable them to better characterize and forecast changes in commodity prices. © 2023"

This paper evaluates the effectiveness of various ensemble learning algorithms, including Boosting (Adaboost and XGBoost), Bagging (Random Forest and Bagging-LSVM), and Stacking, in predicting stock prices using High-Frequency Trading (HFT) data from the Casablanca Stock Exchange. The data contains 311.812 transactions at the millisecond precision level and was obtained under a non-disclosure agreement. Three performance metrics are used: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean of the Squared Errors (MSE) and accuracy of predictions is assessed daily, monthly and annually. The study shows that the Stacking Model outperforms other algorithms in forecasting prices across different periods due to its ability to generate profit from multiple learners and construct a robust model. These results provide valuable insights for improving High-Frequency Trading (HFT) strategies, including the accuracy and robustness of the algorithms in predicting stock prices, which are crucial for effective HFT strategies. The findings highlight how each algorithm characteristics and performance metrics can enhance decision-making in HFT.

We investigate if and how far ahead there is predictability, the importance of a robust data representation, the advantages of multi-horizon modeling, and the presence of universal trading patterns. We use model confidence sets, which provide a formalized statistical inference framework well suited to answer these questions. Our findings show that at high frequencies, predictability in mid-price returns is not just present but ubiquitous.

Accurate prediction of carbon prices can stabilize the carbon market, mitigate investment risks, and promote green development. In this study, firstly, the IVMD and ICEEMDAN are used to decompose carbon price quadratically; secondly, the Dispersion entropy is used to identify the sequence frequency, and then the SOA-LSSVM model and TCN model are used to predict the high-frequency and low-frequency sequences, respectively; finally, the prediction results are integrated by SOA-GRU. As a result, the hybrid IVMD-ICEEMDAN-SOALSSVM/TCN-SOAGRU model was constructed. This framework consistently performs best under two carbon markets, the CEEX Guangzhou and the EU ETS, compared with 21 comparative models, with MAPEs of 0.42% and 0.83%, respectively. The main contributions are as follows: (1) A novel IVMD-ICEEMDAN secondary decomposition method is proposed, which improves the problem of poorly determining the value of the decomposition modal number K in the traditional VMD method and improves the efficiency of the carbon price sequence decomposition. (2) A hybrid forecasting model of LSSVM and TCN is proposed, effectively capturing the features of different sequences. (3) Optimization for LSSVM and GRU using SOA improves the stability and adaptability of the model.

This study takes into account the key factors affecting carbon price, such as international carbon quota trading price, changes in macroeconomic environment, basic energy price and public concern about climate change. Based on the high-frequency, low-frequency, trend term decomposition and integrated noise reduction processing of carbon price data by DWT, CEEMDAN and SSA, the Transformers prediction model is constructed. Further, based on the combination of scenarios and the current status of power enterprises' revenues, a real-world carbon market “tolerance wall value” and a cut-off point are determined. The results show that (1) the predictions of the models using combined modal data are all better than those using unimodal and raw data. (2) The “wall value” of carbon price is 117.6 yuan/ton, 142.3 yuan/ton, and 182.7 yuan/ton under the low carbon follow (LCF) basic as usual (BAU), and economic follow (EF) scenarios, respectively, and all of them are reached by 2029. (3) Measured with realistic data, China's electric power enterprises have paid more than the value of profits (4 % of profits) with a low tolerance level to take part in carbon trading in the market. And under the EF and BAU scenarios, with high tolerance as a parameter, the trading price in China's carbon market will reach the wall value level (119.5yuan/ton) in June 2025 and October 2026, respectively.

Unlike other relatively more stable financial derivatives, the cryptocurrency market has high volatility which requires a high-frequency prediction model for quantitative trading. However, the excessive number of trading becomes a critical issue due to the instability of the prediction results and high error rate. To relieve such a problem, based on the observation of high-frequency data, we use local minimum series to replace the original series and propose a more stable triple trend labeling method that reduces the number of trades by potentially influencing the training of the model. In addition, a new attention-based CNN–LSTM model for multiple cryptocurrencies (ACLMC) is proposed to optimize model effects by exploiting correlations across frequencies and currencies, and to smooth out the investment risk associated with prediction errors by supporting simultaneous multi-currency predictions. Experiments show that our labeling method with ACLMC can achieve much better financial metrics and fewer number of transactions than traditional baselines. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

This paper explores the evolution of price discovery and volatility spillover between the index futures and its spot market amidst the four-phased loosening of trading rules. Utilizing a high-frequency dataset (5-min intervals), our findings unearth that the initial restrictive regulatory framework notably hinders the index futures market's functions of price discovery and volatility spillover. These functions then begin to exhibit signs of recovery as the restrictions are incrementally loosened. However, our analysis also uncovers that an excessive loosening of trading rules conversely impairs these critical market functions.

The prediction task is to classify short-term Forex movements for six currency pairs and five different time intervals from 60 to 720 min. We find that the Transformer exhibits high predictive power in the context of intraday Forex trading. This performance is slightly better than for the carefully selected benchmark – ResNet-LSTM, which currently is a state-of-the-art algorithm. Since intraday Forex trading based on deep learning models is largely unexplored, we offer insight on which currency pair and time interval are amenable to devising a profitable trading strategy. We also show that high predictive accuracy can be misleading in real world trading for short time intervals, as models trained on OHLC data tend to report the highest accuracy when the spread cost is the highest. This renders assessment based on typical machine learning metrics overly optimistic. Therefore, it is critical to backtest frequent intraday Forex trading strategies with realistic cost assumptions, which is rarely the case in empirical literature. Lastly, sensitivity analysis shows that the length of the time interval used for training does not play a critical role in the Transformer's predictive capabilities, whereas features derived from technical analysis are essential. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

In addition, these applications ideally aim to achieve ""line-rate""operation, where the FPGA operates at full bandwidth without using back-pressure to stall incoming data. However, these goals are often conflicting. For example, to minimize latency, application protocols must effectively utilize network bandwidth by encoding variable-length data in variable-length fields. However, variable-length fields often have prohibitively complex processing requirements that prevent line-rate throughput or have excessive latency. In this paper, we present a novel variable-length field parser capable of scaling to accommodate the bus widths and clock frequencies necessary for 100+ Gb/s Ethernet, while still achieving low latency. Our experiments demonstrate parsing variable-length fields at line rate for anticipated bus widths and throughputs, achieving ultra-low latencies under 2 ns for some use cases.

Such methods are model-based and increase the model’s ability to accurately forecast data by adjusting hyperparameters. Although some progress has been made in stock stock price prediction and other aspects, the prediction accuracy of a single model can no longer meet the current financial time series requirements. To address this problem, this work proposes a combined forecasting model based on an improved bionic population intelligence algorithm. Firstly, the Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) method in the field of signal processing is used to fully extract the fluctuation information implied by the big data time series. Secondly, the decomposed low frequency series, trend terms and processed high frequency series are fed into a support vector regression (SVR) model based on the sparrow search algorithm (SSA), and the prediction results are summed up to achieve the final stock market price forecast. Meanwhile, to address the shortcomings of SSA in the optimization process, chaos mapping, sine cosine search strategy, dynamic change strategy, stochastic backward learning strategy and Corsi perturbation are introduced to boost the capability of SSA’s global search as well as its convergence capacity in order to further enhance its forecasting performance. Three evaluation errors, RMSE, MAE and MAPE, are employed in the process of providing a quantitative assessment of the prediction model’s accuracy. The experimental results show that the proposed combined model outperforms other comparative models and possesses better forecasting results, moreover, it provides a new direction for financial time series data forecasting. © 2024, Taiwan Ubiquitous Information CO LTD.

In this paper, the nonparametric regression (NR) model based on kernel function is used to fit the nonlinear relationship between the nonstationary series Yt and its lagging series to model the trend of high frequency financial time series. Furthermore, the deep learning LSTM (long short-term memory) model is applied to capture the high volatility and frequent jumps of high frequency financial data and to improve the forecasting accuracy of the residual series. The results demonstrate that the hybrid NR and LSTM model has greatly improved the forecasting accuracy in several evaluation criteria.

Intraday market efficiency is measured using two widely used measures: the intraday return predictability measure and the variance ratio measure. We find that LOA plays a major role in driving market efficiency. We also use an exogenous shock, the introduction of Shenzhen Stock Connect, which increases trade volume and lowers LOA, to examine the impact of LOA on market efficiency. Our results indicate that this event improves market efficiency regarding both our measures. Therefore, we conclude that policy makers in China are acting in the right direction to elevate China's status in world markets by adapting policies that inherently make the country more attractive to global investors by lowering LOA and enhancing market efficiency. © 2023 The Authors"

Due to the non-stationary and non-linearity of the carbon price, the commonly used methods adopt the ideology of ‘decomposition and integration’ to conduct multiscale forecasting. On this basis, multivariable forecasting discovers more informative knowledge with exogenous variables for carbon price forecasting, but it ignores that (i) the high-frequency and low-frequency components of the carbon price are mainly affected by different variables, and (ii) each variable contributes differently to each component forecasting. To address these challenges, we propose a multiscale and multivariable differentiated learning method for carbon price forecasting in this study. Specifically, different variables are introduced to forecast the high-frequency and low-frequency components, and a novel attention-weighted least squares support vector regression method is first proposed, in which the weight matrix of variables is constructed according to the idea of the attention mechanism. Furthermore, we analyze the contribution of each variable to the carbon price using Shapley additive explanations, thereby providing a reference for carbon market participants. We conduct experiments on the carbon price of the European Union Emissions Trading System and Hubei carbon market in China.

Deep learning (DL) techniques, which can withstand stylized facts, such as non-linearity and long-term memory in high-frequency data, were utilized in this paper. The LSTM algorithm was employed due to its ability to perform well with time series data by reducing fading gradients and reliance over time. The obtained empirical results demonstrate that the LSTM technique can predict both Ethereum and Bitcoin prices. However, the performance of this algorithm decreases as the number of hidden units and epochs grows, with 100 hidden units and 200 epochs delivering maximum forecast accuracy. Furthermore, the performance study demonstrates that the LSTM approach gives more accurate forecasts for Ethereum than for Bitcoin prices, indicating that Ethereum is more prominent than Bitcoin. Moreover, the increased accuracy of forecasting the Ethereum price made it more reliable than Bitcoin during the COVID-19 coronavirus crisis. As a result, cryptocurrency traders might focus on trading Ethereum to increase their earnings during a crisis. © by the authors."

Latency evaluation is conducted for Bitcoin and Ethereum within a single-day timeframe, utilizing the Xilinx Zynq-7000 programmable SoC XC7Z020-CLG484-1 platform. Additionally, various hardware/software (HW/SW) partitioning strategies are explored to leverage the flexibility of software alongside the performance advantages of hardware via the Zynq SoC platform. The results show that the best performing technical indicator is MACD with a speedup of 30 times over its software only counterpart. Furthermore, a hybrid design integrating multiple technical indicators is proposed, pairing MACD with RSI due to their competitive throughput values, differing by only 0.38 microseconds. This hybrid approach capitalizes on the parallel processing capabilities of hardware, enabling multiple systems to operate simultaneously. © 2024 The Author(s)"

However, existing study usually predicts actual carbon prices, rarely considering price trends and lacking reasonable interpretations for the prediction model. Thus, in this study, an interpretable machine learning model is proposed to predict carbon price trends. It integrates five methods, including the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN), two-stage feature selection (TFS), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) optimized by Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA), and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). The effectiveness of the proposed model is validated with the carbon prices of the Hubei carbon trading market, which has the largest volume among Chinese markets. The experimental results showed that the proposed model outperforms other benchmark models under five evaluation criteria, including AUC, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 score, on multiple-step predictions. For one-step-ahead prediction, the average hit ratio results are 0.8342, 77.32 %, 77.87 %, 76.83 %, and 76.88 % respectively; for five-step-ahead prediction, the average hit ratio results are 0.7641, 69.25 %, 71.17 %, 71.97 %, and 71.00 % respectively; and for ten-step-ahead prediction, the average hit ratio results are 0.7519, 69.11 %, 73.80 %, 69.61 %, and 71.16 % respectively. The SHAP model interpretation results indicated that the high-frequency intrinsic mode function (IMF) components of the historical carbon price are the most important features for predicting carbon price trends. This study contributes by forecasting both the upward and downward trends of carbon prices through multi-step-ahead forecasting with the LightGBM model and further interpreting the model's predictions with the SHAP approach. Therefore, the proposed model has excellent forecasting performance with interpretability, which is an effective tool for forecasting carbon price trends. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

The key problems addressed are effectively modelling complex limit order book (LOB) and order flow (OF) microstructure data and improving prediction accuracy over current state-of-the-art models. The proposed deep learning model, TrioFlow Fusion of Convolutional Layers and Gated Recurrent Units (TFF-CL-GRU), takes LOB and OF features as input and consists of convolutional layers splitting into three channels before rejoining into a Gated Recurrent Unit. Key innovations include a tailored input representation incorporating LOB and OF features across recent timestamps, a hierarchical feature-learning architecture leveraging convolutional and recurrent layers, and a model design specifically optimised for LOB and OF data. Experiments utilise a new dataset (MICEX LOB OF) with over 1.5 million LOB and OF records and the existing LOBSTER dataset. Comparative evaluation against the state-of-the-art models demonstrates significant performance improvements with the TFF-CL-GRU approach. Through simulated trading experiments, the model also demonstrates practical applicability, yielding positive returns when used for trade signals. This work contributes a new dataset, performance improvements for microstructure-based price prediction, and insights into effectively applying deep learning to financial time-series data. The results highlight the viability of data-driven deep learning techniques in algorithmic trading systems. © 2024 by the authors."

The findings unveiled that heightened oscillation frequencies led to diminished porosity levels, and this pattern remained consistent, even in cases where weld depths were extended.

It has been conjectured that emotional engagement in anticipation of risky outcomes constitutes “good” emotions. We introduce a new methodology to determine whether anticipatory emotional engagement is beneficial in the context of trading in financial markets. We focus on heart rate changes because they occur at a sufficiently high frequency to discern timing relative to events in the marketplace. After conservatively adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing, we find that participants whose heart rate changes anticipate their order submissions at inflated prices earn significantly more, whereas participants whose heart rate responds to their trades earn significantly less. By investigating cointegration between skin conductance response and the dynamics of individual portfolio values, we confirm the importance of emotional involvement in determining who makes or loses money.

Our goal is nonparametric inference for the average intraday volatility pattern, viewed as a function of time-of-day. The functional inference is based on a long span of high-frequency return data. Our setup allows for general forms of volatility dynamics, including time-variation in the intraday pattern. The estimation is based on forming local volatility estimates from the high-frequency returns over overlapping blocks of asymptotically shrinking size, and then averaging these estimates across days in the sample. The block-based estimation of volatility renders the error in the estimation due to the martingale return innovation asymptotically negligible. As a result, the centered and scaled calendar volatility effect estimator converges to a Gaussian process determined by the empirical process error associated with estimating average volatility across the trading day. Feasible inference is obtained by consistently estimating the limiting covariance operator. Simulation results corroborate our theoretical findings. In an application to S&P 500 futures data, we find evidence for a shift in the intraday volatility pattern over time, including a more pronounced role for volatility outside U.S. trading hours in the latter part of the sample.

This paper proposes a deep evolutionary reinforcement learning (DERL) model that combines deep reinforcement learning with evolutionary strategies to address these challenges. Reinforcement learning is applied to data cleaning and factor extraction from a high-frequency, microscopic viewpoint to quantitatively explain the supply and demand imbalance and to create trading strategies. In order to determine whether the algorithm can successfully extract the significant hidden features in the factors when faced with large and complex high-frequency factors, this paper trains the agent in reinforcement learning using three different learning algorithms, including Q-learning, evolutionary strategies, and policy gradient. The experimental dataset, which contains data on sharp up, sharp down, and continuous oscillation situations, was chosen to test Bitcoin in January-February, September, and November of 2022. According to the experimental results, the evolutionary strategies algorithm achieved returns of 59.18%, 25.14%, and 22.72%, respectively. The results demonstrate that deep reinforcement learning based on the evolutionary strategies outperforms Q-learning and policy gradient concerning risk resistance and return capability. The proposed approach offers a robust and adaptive solution for high-frequency trading in the digital currency market, contributing to the development of effective quantitative trading strategies.

Incorporating deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with imitative learning methodologies, we bolster the proficiency of our model. To tackle the challenges posed by volatile financial datasets, we conceptualize the QT mechanism within the framework of a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). Moreover, by embedding imitative learning, the model can capitalize on traditional trading tactics, nurturing a balanced synergy between discovery and utilization. For a more realistic simulation, our trading agent undergoes training using minute-frequency data sourced from the live financial market. Experimental findings underscore the model's proficiency in extracting robust market features and its adaptability to diverse market conditions. © 2024 IEEE."

The increasing development of high-frequency trading and the explosive growth of data volume increasingly require online portfolio strategies to have fast execution speed. However, almost all existing online portfolio strategies cannot satisfy both effective and full utilization of historical data and fast execution speed simultaneously. To this end, this work proposes the Adaptive Moment Estimation (AME) strategy. The proposed strategy makes effective and full utilization of historical data in an incremental way, which not only achieves improved robustness in performance but also keeps linear time complexity. Theoretical and experimental analysis are respectively established to analyze the effectiveness of the proposed AME strategy. For theoretical analysis, AME’s universality is proved, which illustrates that it can theoretically compete with the benchmark Best Constant Rebalanced Portfolio in hindsight. For experimental analysis, AME achieves good performance on different evaluation metrics, and it can sustain reasonable transaction costs. Thus, it is a robust and excellent strategy with promising practical application prospects. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

Ever since the inception of Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT), financial scholars have persistently sought factors capable of predicting returns. These factors are seamlessly integrated into quantitative trading strategies like portfolio construction and high-frequency trading. Traditionally, the search for these factors entails a manual identification process based on logical and economic intuition. This method is not only inefficient but also incurs considerable labor costs. To address this challenge, the present study introduces a factor mining framework named Ultra Factor Optimizer (UFO), designed to efficiently produce Alpha factors on a large scale. Within this study, we integrate the Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering algorithm to group assets sharing similar characteristics. The goal is to facilitate the model's access to hidden information. Subsequently, each group undergoes Genetic Programming to create algorithmic factors through iterative training, aiming to identify factors with a high Information Ratio (IR) and low correlation with the output. Empirical analysis is conducted within the cryptocurrency market, specifically focusing on mining time-series and cross-sectional factors. The experimental outcomes demonstrate that the UFO framework can generate a significant number of Alpha factors across time-series, cross-sections, and various K-bar periods. Additionally, we confirm that pre-clustering assets with DBSCAN leads to superior results. UFO not only drastically improves the research efficiency of factor mining but also has versatile applications, significantly impacting the realms of quantitative trading and factor investing. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."

Since the WDEA considers a DMU at a period to be a distinct DMU, this method has several limitations, including a high computational cost and a lack of knowledge regarding the consistency of a DMU during a window. This study proposes a novel window analysis in which the information of a DMU during the window is linked, utilizing the new notions of “linked DMU” and “linked variable”. Consequently, an inconsistent DMU in a window would not be eligible for a high efficiency score, despite the fact that it might be the most efficient at certain times. To approximate the globally optimal result, the Whale Optimization Algorithm, one of the state-of-the-art meta-heuristics, is used. This ensures that the optimal solution is not trapped in local extremes, as is the case with linear programming methods. Furthermore, the proposed method is applied to evaluating the effectiveness of foreign exchange investment strategies as well as the effectiveness of companies in the utility industry, listed in the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange. To our knowledge, this is the first time a WDEA-based method has been utilized in those fields.

Three skewed distributions (the skewed t distribution, the skewed generalized error distribution and the skewed generalized t distribution) are used to generate unconditional IVaR. For conditional IVaR, a hybrid method combining the autoregressive conditional duration (ACD) model and the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model is considered. We analyze 36 variations of the ACD-GARCH model, 35 of which have not been investigated before. Backtesting results show that the unconditional models are appropriate for the first 30 minutes of the trading session, emphasizing the need for a time-varying mean and volatility at longer forecast horizons. The conditional ACD-GARCH models underestimate the risk for midcap ETFs but are suitable for one-day ahead forecasting for small-and large-cap ETFs. The choice of the ACD form (ie, linear or nonlinear) and the error distribution have no impact on the validity of the ACD-GARCH model.

A “flash collapse” is when the price of bonds, stocks, or other commodities drops sharply but then quickly rises again. The market will quickly decline, but prices will almost immediately rise again. The US stock market saw a flash crash on May 6, 2010, which was a rare occurrence in the trading system and revealed the market’s susceptibility to high-frequency trading (HFT). Numerous researchers have provided an overview of the incident and the market’s response by highlighting crucial elements like algorithmic trading (AT), the volume and frequency of selling orders in the market, the current market volatility, and the statements that were highlighted as having a significant relationship with flash collapses. This has prompted a number of regulatory and trading organizations to draft new legislation aimed at reducing the likelihood of having such catastrophes in the future. Effective regulation is needed to ensure that traders do not engage in stock manipulation or negatively impact other investors’ ability to buy and sell shares when trading based on transient price variations and trends. One cause of flash crashes is computer programs or algorithms. Therefore, to demonstrate the operation and influence of high-frequency traders, this test case has been constructed to understand how algorithms can impact trading and manipulate the entire market. © 2024 by World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.

The profits come from building intra-day positions of futures against partial baskets of stocks, locking in future’s fair value basis and benefiting from short term pricing anomalies in the stocks. It supports trading up to a USD 100 million turnover a day, with an average daily profit of 8bps. We would hence make a yearly PnL of USD 20 million.

BTC perpetual futures are derivative contracts, which depend upon the underlying BTC SPOT (current) price. Pricing perpetual futures fairly is hard, using traditional arbitrage arguments, because of the volatile nature of the so called funding rate, which is used as the replacement of risk free rate in the Cryptocurrency market. This work presents a novel technique for pricing BTC futures contracts using conditional volatility and mean models. Intra-day high-frequency futures' return volatility and mean are modelled using different ML and econometric techniques. A comparison is made using statistical measures to find the model that best captures the intra-day conditional mean and volatility. Exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity is shown to be an almost unbiased predictor of intra-day volatility, while a constant autoregressive moving average (0, 0) model best captures the conditional mean of the returns. A market directional high frequency trading algorithm is developed using the volatility and mean models. The algorithm first prices the futures contract at some future point of time using the volatility and mean regression models. Next, the slope between the current futures price and the expected price are used to predict the market direction. A long or short position is taken depending upon the expected market direction movement. Extensive back-testing results show absolute returns of 1500%–8000% depending upon the transaction fees and leverage used. On average, the market direction is predicted correctly 85% of the time by the best model. Finally, the trading technique is market neutral, in that it gives large positive returns, with low SD, in both bull and bear markets. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Despite the success of volatility models in univariate scenarios, challenges arise due to increasing dimensionality of covariance matrices and lower asset liquidity in emerging markets. Methods: In this study, we utilize intraday stock trading data from the Brazilian Market to compute daily covariance matrices using various specifications. To mitigate dimensionality issues in covariance matrix estimation, we implement penalization restrictions on coefficients through regressions with shrinkage techniques using Ridge, LASSO, or Elastic Net estimators. These techniques are employed to capture the dynamics of covariance matrices. Results: Comparison of covariance construction models is performed using the Model Confidence Set (MCS) algorithm, which selects the best models based on their predictive performance. The findings indicate that the method used for estimating the covariance matrix significantly impacts the selection of the best models. Additionally, it is observed that more liquid sectors demonstrate greater intra-sectoral dynamics. Discussion: While the results benefit from shrinkage techniques, the high correlation between assets presents challenges in capturing stock or sector idiosyncrasies. This suggests the need for further exploration and refinement of methods to better capture the complexities of volatility dynamics in emerging markets like Brazil.

I argue instead on two main grounds that spoofing should be permitted and legalised. The first is that spoofing as a form of bluffing remains within the market practice of making legally binding offers—as opposed to lying or betraying trust—and primarily concerns the spoofer’s personal information. As a form of bluffing spoofing helps prevent financial speculators, in particular high-frequency algorithmic traders, from easily profiting by other market actors reliably revealing their underlying preferences through their market activity. The second is that at the systemic level permitting spoofing would benefit non-speculative actors who place orders to hedge economic risk and whose activities provide the raison d’être for financial exchanges, differentiating them from simple forums for gambling. I also address potential concerns that legalised spoofing would drive speculators out of financial markets entirely and, therefore, undermine market liquidity. This work contributes to the wider debate in business ethics regarding bluffing by illustrating the acceptability of bluffs which do not betray counterparty trust or reliance on testimony by remaining within the framework of market practices. © 2022, The Author(s)."

Since its listing on 21 September 2018, the copper options market, developing on the fast track, has become the largest copper options market in the world, and thus it is of important meaning to study its market efficiency. Taking the data of China’s copper options market from its debut to 30 April 2022 as a sample, this paper studies the efficiency of this market using three typical risk-free arbitrages such as put-call-future parity arbitrage, box spread arbitrage, and boundary arbitrage strategies. To better reflect the actual situation, this paper, when establishing options arbitrage strategy models, not only took into account various actual trading factors such as transaction costs, market impact costs, liquidity costs, margin, and capital opportunity costs but also combined daily and high-frequency data to present highly practical arbitrage strategies. According to empirical results, there are few arbitrage opportunities with a very low proportion when actual trading factors were considered.

We find that greater HFT leads to a greater deviation of stock prices from accounting-based valuation estimates. The results hold across univariate, multivariate, and cross-sectional tests, as well as a natural experiment that induces an exogenous shock to HFT for a small sample of firms.

We also integrate Markovian baseline intensities into the event arrival dynamic, by including the impacts of order book liquidity state and time factor on the baseline intensity. A regression-based nonparametric estimation procedure is adopted to estimate the model parameters in our Hawkes+Markovian model. To eliminate redundant model parameters, LASSO regularization is incorporated into the estimation procedure. Besides, a model selection method based on Akaike information criteria is applied to evaluate the effect of each part of the proposed model.

A suitable ratio of these estimates removes the stochastic components of the conditional expectations of future volatility, up to asymptotically higher-order terms, and allows to form estimates of the deterministic periodic component of volatility.

By analyzing their customers’ trading, spending and investment habits, financial institutions can customize products and services to provide solutions that are closer to their customers’ needs, thereby increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty. Financial services data research can help reveal the financial needs and behaviors of different populations and help design more inclusive financial products and services. Through universal access to digital financial services, more people can be integrated into the financial system and promote inclusive economic growth.

With this robust realized integrated beta estimator, we investigate dynamic structures of integrated betas and find a persistent autoregressive structure. To model this dynamic structure, we utilize the autoregressive–moving-average (ARMA) model for daily integrated market betas. We call this the dynamic realized beta (DR Beta). Then, we propose a quasi-likelihood procedure for estimating the parameters of the ARMA model with the robust realized integrated beta estimator as the proxy. We establish asymptotic theorems for the proposed estimator and conduct a simulation study to check the performance of finite samples of the estimator. The proposed DR Beta model with the robust realized beta estimator is also illustrated by using data from the E-mini S&P 500 index futures and the top 50 large trading volume stocks from the S&P 500 and an application to constructing market-neutral portfolios. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

We employ a first-order time-homogeneous discrete-time Markov chain model to the sequence of orders of stocks belonging to six different sectors during the US-China trade war of 2018. The Markov property of the order sequence is validated by the Chi-square test. We estimate the transition probability matrix of the sequence using maximum likelihood estimation. From the heatmap of these matrices, we found the presence of active participation by different types of traders during high volatility days. On such days, these traders place limit orders primarily with the intention of deleting the majority of them to influence the market. These findings are supported by high stationary distribution and low mean recurrence values of add and delete orders. Further, we found similar spectral gap and entropy rate values, which indicates that similar trading strategies are employed on both high and low volatility days during the trade war. Among all the sectors considered in this study, we observe that there is a recurring pattern of full execution orders in the Finance & Banking sector. This shows that the banking stocks are resilient during the trade war.

In the first part of the article, the authors argue that their widespread adoption can be attributed to the universality of the mean-variance paradigm, wherein the maximum expected utility and mean-variance allocations coincide for a broad range of distributional assumptions of asset returns. Subsequently, they introduce a formal definition of mean-variance equivalence and present a novel and comprehensive characterization of distributions, termed mean-variance-equivalent (MVE) distributions, wherein expected utility maximization and the solution of an MVO problem are the same. In the second part of the article, the authors address common myths associated with MVO. These myths include the misconception that MVO necessitates normally distributed asset returns, the belief that it is unsuitable for cases with asymmetric return distributions, the notion that it maximizes errors, and the perception that it underperforms a simple 1/n portfolio in out-of-sample tests. Furthermore, they address misunderstandings regarding MVO's ability to handle signals across different time horizons, its treatment of transaction costs, its applicability to intraday and high-frequency trading, and whether quadratic utility accurately represents investor preferences. © 2024 With Intelligence LLC."

The application of structural topic modelling also unravels five prominent thematic clusters, namely pattern-based forecasting, rule-based trading, algorithmic trading, techno-fundamental trading, and machine learning & sentiment analysis. The topic of pattern-based forecasting involves researching the application of various patterns or models to predict stock prices. Rule-based trading concentrates on utilizing technical analysis tools to generate buy and sell signals, aiming for profitability. The algorithmic trading cluster explores the use of algorithms to systematically execute buy and sell actions, especially in high-frequency trading scenarios. Techno-fundamental trading investigates the integration of both fundamental and technical analysis in trading and investment decisions. Lastly, machine learning & sentiment analysis focus on applying advanced machine learning techniques and sentiment analysis for predicting stock prices, highlighting the use of sophisticated methods in this domain.

The strategy makes a profit from the bid-ask spread for every buy and sell transaction, against the risk of adverse selection, uncertain execution and inventory risk. We design realistic simulations of limit order markets and develop a high-frequency market making strategy in which agents process order book information to post the optimal price, order type and execution time. By introducing the Deep Hawkes process to the high-frequency market making strategy, we allow a feedback loop to be created between order arrival and the state of the limit order book, together with self- and cross-excitation effects. Our high-frequency market making strategy accounts for the cancellation of orders that influence order queue position, profitability, bid-ask spread and the value of the order. The experimental results show that our trading agent outperforms the baseline strategy, which uses a probability density estimate of the fundamental price. We investigate the effect of cancellations on market quality and the agent's profitability.

This paper estimates compound, inhomogeneous Poisson processes (CIPP) where trades arrive according to an inhomogeneous Poisson process, and returns are drawn from a distribution after arrival. The intensity functions have Gaussian process priors to model time-of-day (diurnal) effects, which have bursts of activity at the open and close and a midday lull, and lagged returns from the previous trade, which are idiosyncratic and depend on the stock. The nonparametric density estimator for returns imposes a shape constraint to obtain a unimodal distribution that is asymmetric and leptokurtic. A mixture model separates trades into time sensitive and time insensitive trades with different intensity functions. The latter group tends to have larger orders and higher returns. The proposed model is compared to B-splines and geometric Brownian motion. © 2024 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

However, theoretical analysis cannot reveal the complex links between carbon, green, and grey markets. Therefore, this study resorts to the frequency spillover index to explore the overall and directional connectedness of carbon-energy systems in China. The spillover effect indicates the cross-market propagation of information shocks and the potential ripple effects of specific shocks on system-wide changes. Dynamic spillovers suggest that the role of a certain market is not unchanged. In the time domain, both the overall and directional spillovers are closely related with the trading of carbon allowances and tend to show jumps at the beginning and end of the cycle. In the frequency domain, the short-term effects are much stronger than the medium- and long-term effects on all dimensions of the spillover effect. Comparatively, the grey energy is the main information transmitter at the high frequency, whereas it is the green energy playing such a role at medium and low frequencies. Comparing the overall spillovers on carbon markets, the effect of grey energy exceeds that of green energy. Even so, the carbon market plays an important role in the carbon-energy system with extremely significant effects on green and grey energy stocks at certain periods. The results provide profound implications for the management of carbon markets and portfolio optimization. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

As current e-commerce schemes are vulnerable to computational attacks, quantum cryptography, ensuring information-theoretic security against adversary’s repudiation and forgery, provides a solution to this problem. However, quantum solutions generally have much lower performance compared to classical ones. Besides, when considering imperfect devices, the performance of quantum schemes exhibits a notable decline. Here, we demonstrate the whole e-commerce process of involving the signing of a contract and payment among three parties by proposing a quantum e-commerce scheme, which shows resistance of attacks from imperfect devices. Results show that with a maximum attenuation of 25 dB among participants, our scheme can achieve a signature rate of 0.82 times per second for an agreement size of approximately 0.428 megabit.

Stock market returns inevitably rise as globalization keeps integrating financial markets and economies around the world. Thus, the impact of war is assessed across a range of indicators that are similar in some way, such as geographic location, political climate or economic standing. Thus, the goal of this study is to investigate how the Israel-Hamas war affects trading partner countries' stock performance. Design/methodology/approach: Event study methodology is applied using Morgan Stanley Capital Index (MSCI) as a benchmark index. The influence of the Israel-Hamas war on the world's major stock markets is evaluated using a market model. The study takes into account Israel and its 23 trading partners. To capture the locational asymmetry in the outcome, the countries are further categorized according to their geographic locations. The official declaration of war came on October 7, 2023, a non-trading day. Consequently, October 9, 2023, is designated as the event day in this study. The data was gathered between January 1, 2023, and December 31, 2023, with an estimation period of 140 days taken into account to minimize bias. Findings: Asymmetric response is shown among the nations due to their economic standing, geographic proximity and trading links with Israel. While Austria, Greece, Egypt, Palestine and Israel had the greatest negative effects, Argentina, Japan and Chile saw significant beneficial effects. The remaining nations had little effect. The market quickly adjusted itself, eliminating anomalous returns. Research limitations/implications: Taking into account the topic's criticality, the current work has certain limits. The study has used the daily data to limit its reach to the stock market exclusively. In the future, academics can combine high-frequency stock market data with data from other macroeconomic variables, such as currency or different commodities markets, to further their research. Furthermore, a cross-national comparison of the impact in terms of direction and intensity regarding developing global groups such as I2U2, LEVANT, BRICS, MIKTA, SCO, NATO, SAARC and OECD can provide a more comprehensive understanding in this context. To gain insight into the durability and adaptation of financial systems over time, longitudinal studies could be conducted to monitor the long-term effects of geopolitical crises on the stock markets of trading partner countries. Practical implications: By better managing investment portfolios and evaluating potential risks associated with trading partners involved in such conflicts, investors and businesses can lessen the impact of geopolitical tensions on stock market performance. These results contribute to our understanding of how geopolitical conflicts affect stock markets. Originality/value: This research provides an extensive analysis of the global impact of Israel-Hamas tensions on stock market volatility by taking into account trading partners. This allows for the investigation of how various market structures and economic systems react to geopolitical turmoil. The present study is one of the first attempts to look into how disturbances in one region might affect continents to better understand the dynamics of global trade and economic interdependencies. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited."

This paper elevates PTS by integrating trend-stationary value processes, thereby enhancing profitability and expanding trading opportunities. Our asymptotic analysis reveals that the value process, adjusted for the derived slant asymptote, adheres to a stationary distribution. By capitalizing on price deviations and value trends, the strategy profits by longing undervalued or shorting overvalued processes based on their respective upward or downward slopes. Positions are strategically closed when they revert to the asymptote, thus securing profits and avoiding counterproductive trades against prevailing trends. In this context, conventional stationary-based PTS can be considered a specific instance of our broader approach when the asymptote is non-trended. To refine trade selection, we evaluate the mean-reversion velocity, monitoring the frequency at which the portfolio's value crosses the slant asymptote to exclude high-risk pairs. Empirical evidence underscores our method's superiority over conventional stationary PTS, delivering higher average returns per trade, improved Sharpe ratios, and increased trading opportunities, even amidst the financial uncertainties of the COVID era. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."

Accurate stock price forecasting not only aids the government in predicting economic trends but also helps investors anticipate higher expected returns. Nevertheless, hurdles such as nonlinearity, complexity and high volatility make it a daunting task to predict stock prices. To address this issue, this study proposes a new hybrid model, termed Hierarchical Decomposition-based Forecasting Model (HDFM), to decompose and forecast stock prices in a hierarchical fashion. The model utilizes complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) for the initial decomposition of stock price time series. To enhance the predictive efficiency, sub-series with similar sample entropy from the decomposition were combined using the K-means clustering method. Through a thorough analysis, it was found that the first combined sub-series contained more high-frequency signals. Therefore, the first combined sub-series is subjected to a second decomposition with variational mode decomposition (VMD). Subsequently, the gated recurrent unit (GRU) model was used to individually predict each sub-series. The final results were obtained by merging the prediction outcomes. The proposed model was evaluated on three different stock markets. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms other forecasting methods across all stock indices. Moreover, ablation studies demonstrated the effectiveness of each component within the proposed model.  © 2013 IEEE."

It has been shown that training market makers (MMs) with adversarial reinforcement learning allows to overcome the risks due to changing market conditions and to lead to robust performances. Prior work assumes, however, that MMs keep quoting throughout the trading process, but in practice this is not required, even for ""registered""MMs (that only need to satisfy quoting ratios defined by the market rules). In this paper, we build on this line of work and enrich the strategy space of the MM by allowing to occasionally not quote or provide single-sided quotes. Towards this end, in addition to the MM agents that provide continuous bid-ask quotes, we have designed two new agents with increasingly richer action spaces. The first has the option to provide bid-ask quotes or refuse to quote. The second has the option to provide bid-ask quotes, refuse to quote, or only provide single-sided ask or bid quotes. We employ a model-driven approach to empirically compare the performance of the continuously quoting MM with the two agents above in various types of adversarial environments. We demonstrate how occasional refusal to provide bid-ask quotes improves returns and/or Sharpe ratios. The quoting ratios of well-trained MMs can basically meet any market requirements, reaching up to 99.9 in some cases. © 2023 ACM."

Compared to traditional low-frequency data (e.g., daily, weekly), high-frequency data (e.g., minute-level) is often underutilized for low-frequency stock trend prediction, leaving the vast potential for improvement. However, valuable and noisy information coexist in high-frequency data. The learning process of high-frequency factor extractors can easily be overwhelmed by noise, leading to overfitting. Moreover, common techniques used to prevent overfitting often result in poor performance on this task since they usually roughly restrict the model&#x0027;s capacity, making it challenging to model complex trading signals in high-frequency data. When designing high-frequency factor extractors, we face a tough dilemma. A high-capacity model may easily overfit to noise, while a simple but robust model may not capture complex high-frequency patterns. To address these problems, we propose maintaining model capacity while preventing overfitting by constructing two components that balance information and noise through interactions between them. Specifically, we propose a novel learning framework called Digger-Guider to extract informative stock representations from noisy high-frequency data. We develop a high-capacity model called Digger to extract local and detailed features from the high-frequency data, and we design a robust model called Guider to capture global tendency features and help the Digger overcome the noise. The Digger and Guider enhance each other through mutual distillation during training, serving as data-driven regularizations that work well on this task. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework can produce powerful high-frequency stock factors that significantly improve stock trend prediction performance and our understanding of the finance market.

The fluctuation of copper price has a great impact on the industry, especially on the development of the national economy, so predicting copper price has a great significance for economic development. However, traditional time series prediction models' prediction accuracy is low. Therefore, this paper proposes a Shanghai copper price forecasting model based on Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Self Attention Gated Unit (SAGU), named CEEMDAN-CNN-SAGU. CEEMDAN decomposes and reconstructs the Shanghai copper price data. In this paper, the zero-cross rate of the Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) components is calculated, the IMF component with large noise is removed, and the remaining IMFs and Residual term (Res) are reorganized to obtain the high-frequency and low-frequency components. CNN performs convolution operations on the reconstructed components to extract time series features. SAGU is a new time series data prediction model proposed in this paper. SAGU includes two gated units (a forgetting gate and an input gate), and two data processing modules (Self Attention (SA) and Transition (Tra)). The SA module is responsible for processing the input data, redistributing the weight coefficients of different data, and improving the model's attention to important information. The Tra module improves the low limit of the forgetting gate's output so that the gated unit can keep the cell state from the previous moment to the current moment as much as possible.

Two volatility measures, the realized variance ((Formula presented.)) and realized bi-power variations ((Formula presented.)) are constructed at various frequencies by virtue of 1-minute crude oil futures prices. The distinctive components of these volatility estimators are further identified to exploit the information contents in the in-sample explanatory power of the realized variance dynamics and the out-of-sample prediction of realized variance across different horizons, leading to four new HAR-RV-type models. First, the empirical results show that the continuous component of the weekly realized variance, representing investors' trading behavior in the medium-term, is the dominant factor driving up volatility trends in China's crude oil futures market over a range of market conditions. Second, the monthly jump component in realized variance presents the significant in-sample explanatory power, and yet marginally improves prediction performance in realized variance during the two out-of-sample periods. Finally, these results are robust toward various market/model setups, over day- and night-trading hours, and across a range of prediction horizons and relative to prediction benchmarks. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

In combination with non-parametric techniques such as the very popular Singular Value Decomposition (SSA), it can give iterative algorithms that deal with this problem but create huge needs in computing power, especially in problems where we need fast response of the system (for example in high frequency trading).

We devise a noise-calendar-effect estimator by an appropriately scaled average of high-frequency returns that precede a time of day across a large number of trading days. Feasible central limit theorem for the estimator is established under a joint infill and long-span asymptotics. Monte Carlo simulations corroborate our theoretical findings.

We design, implement, and assess a novel high-frequency agent-based financial market simulator that generates realistic millisecond-level financial price time series for the E-Mini S&P 500 futures market. Specifically, a microstructure model of a single security traded on a central limit order book is provided, where different types of traders follow different behavioural rules. The model is calibrated using the machine learning surrogate modelling approach. Statistical test and moment coverage ratio results show that the model has excellent capability of reproducing realistic stylised facts in financial markets. By introducing an institutional trader that mimics the real-world Sell Algorithm on May 6th, 2010, the proposed high-frequency agent-based financial market simulator is used to simulate the Flash Crash that took place on that day. We scrutinise the market dynamics during the simulated flash crash and show that the simulated dynamics are consistent with what happened in historical flash crash scenarios. With the help of Monte Carlo simulations, we discover functional relationships between the amplitude of the simulated 2010 Flash Crash and three conditions: the percentage of volume of the Sell Algorithm, the market maker inventory limit, and the trading frequency of fundamental traders. Similar analyses are carried out for mini flash crash events. An innovative ""Spiking Trader"" is introduced to the model, replicating real-world scenarios that could precipitate mini flash crash events. We analyse the market dynamics during the course of a typical simulated mini flash crash event and study the conditions affecting its characteristics. The proposed model can be used for testing resiliency and robustness of trading algorithms and providing advice for policymakers. © 2024, University of Surrey. All rights reserved."

Although of great appeal, it poses a series of challenges when applied in decentralized collaborative trading scenarios. On the one hand, model owners should constantly fine-tune AI models to meet customized needs, which causes heavy updating overhead. On the other hand, collaborative AI model training results in copyright sharing between multiple owners, which necessitates differential AI model royalties to adapt to the development of trading market. To address these challenges, we design a smart contract aided dynamic multi-owner copyright scheme with hierarchical differential royalties for collaborative AI model trading. First, to meet the frequent updating requirements, we propose a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) driven dynamic AI model copyright protection structure, integrating InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and NFT to realize low-cost AI model updating. Second, a batch AI model trading smart contract is designed to further reduce the trading cost in high-frequency trading scenarios. Third, we establish a hierarchical differential royalties collection and allocation mechanism for multi-owner AI models, where the AI model royalties are adaptively adjusted over time, utilization frequency, and the number of customers, and are allocated differentially based on training contributions. Last but not least, we conduct comprehensive evaluation and analysis of our scheme, demonstrating its efficiency, availability and flexibility.  © 2024 IEEE."

Notably, within China’s distinctive market regulatory framework, stock transactions are limited to a daily. Consequently, this article delves into the exploration of daily-updated high-frequency stock trading strategies within this unique market context. This study aims to develop an advanced high-frequency trading algorithm and compare the performance of three different mathematical models: the combination of the cross-entropy loss function and the quasi-Newton algorithm, the FCNN (Fully Connected Neural Network) model, and the support vector machine model. The proposed algorithm employs neural network predictions to generate trading signals and execute buy and sell operations based on specific conditions. By harnessing the power of neural networks, the algorithm enhances the accuracy and reliability of the trading strategy. To assess the effectiveness of the algorithm, the study evaluates the performance of the three mathematical models. The combination of the cross-entropy loss function and the quasi-Newton algorithm is a widely utilized logistic regression approach. The FCNN model, on the other hand, is a deep learning algorithm that can extract and classify features from stock data. Meanwhile, the support vector machine is a supervised learning algorithm recognized for achieving improved classification results by mapping data into high-dimensional spaces. By comparing the performance of these three models, the study aims to determine the most effective approach for high-frequency trading.

However, traditional centralized power trading platforms often struggle to rapidly respond to transaction requests and make efficient decisions. Therefore, a distributed and automated microgrid transaction scheme based on blockchain and incentive compatibility mechanisms is proposed. This scheme employs an incentive-compatible bilateral auction mechanism to induce users to make transaction bids based on their true valuations. Simultaneously, the scheme designs a sharded PBFT consensus algorithm optimization strategy and integrates a reputation mechanism to enhance the efficiency and security of the PBFT algorithm. Finally, simulation experiments are conducted on a 17-node blockchain network, confirming the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed solution. © Beijing Paike Culture Commu. Co., Ltd. 2024."

We develop an agent-based simulation model of a financial market and, in addition to the agents with fixed strategies used in previous research, we introduce an agent with a self-learning strategy. To model the behavior of such an agent, we use deep reinforcement learning algorithms, namely deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG). Next, we conduct a comparative analysis of the results of the constructed model with outcomes of previously proposed models, as well as with the characteristics of real market. To conduct comparative analysis, we use stylized facts of asset returns that allow us to evaluate and compare the characteristics of the markets. Our results show that a model with a self-learning agent gives a better approximation of the real market than a model with classic agents. In particular, unlike the model with classical agents, the model with a self-learning agent turns out to be not so heavy-tailed. Thus, we demonstrate that for a complete understanding of market processes simulation models should take into account self-learning agents that have a significant presence at modern financial markets. Finally, we present the python package, which was developed by us as part of the research implementation.

We confirm a trend reversal of the risk-return relation between day and night in the Chinese market: the assets’ intraday returns are negatively correlated with their market risk level, whereas their overnight returns are positively correlated with their risk level. Further investigation shows a connection between the intraday beta variation and the day-night reversal anomaly, and the risk-return reversal between day and night can be partially explained by the intraday beta variation of financial assets.

This paper applies functional classification and dynamic prediction (FCDP) to forecast the cumulative intraday returns of INE and Brent crude oil futures for every 5 min, to address the characteristics of high-frequency data and complex change patterns of crude oil futures market. The primary goal of FCDP is to classify trading days with the same volatility pattern employing probabilistic functional classification based on the artificial distinction between the daytime and nighttime trading hours, and then to generate forecasts using the classification results. The robustness test compares the forecasting results of FCDP with ARIMA, OLS and RW methods. According to the findings, FCDP outperforms other methods when it comes to making predictions concerning crude oil futures. Due to the FCDP's incorporation of the concept of dynamic updating, which is not reflected in conventional prediction methods, the prediction error gradually lowers as the amount of seen data increases.

Due to these inherent characteristics of time series data, forecasting based on this data type is a highly challenging problem. In many studies within the literature, high-frequency components are commonly excluded from time series data. However, these high-frequency components can contain valuable information, and their removal may adversely impact the prediction performance of models. In this study, a novel method called Two-Level Entropy Ratio-Based Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (2LE-CEEMDAN) is proposed for the first time to effectively denoise time series data. Financial time series with high noise levels are utilized to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The 2LE-CEEMDAN-LSTM-SVR model is introduced to predict the next day’s closing value of stock market indices within the scope of financial time series. This model comprises two main components: denoising and forecasting. In the denoising section, the proposed 2LE-CEEMDAN method eliminates noise in financial time series, resulting in denoised intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). In the forecasting part, the next-day value of the indices is estimated by training on the denoised IMFs obtained. Two different artificial intelligence methods, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Support Vector Regression (SVR), are utilized during the training process. The IMF, characterized by more linear characteristics than the denoised IMFs, is trained using the SVR, while the others are trained using the LSTM method. The final prediction result of the 2LECEEMDAN- LSTM-SVR model is obtained by integrating the prediction results of each IMF. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed 2LE-CEEMDAN denoising method positively influences the model’s prediction performance, and the 2LE-CEEMDAN-LSTM-SVR model outperforms other prediction models in the existing literature. © 2024, Akşehir and Kılıç Distributed under Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0.

Algorithmic trading gives traders the ability to trade or receive orders within extremely brief time intervals, such as minutes or seconds based. The very nature of high-frequency trading necessitates the use of high-speed data feeds, which deliver information in real time as well as trade executions for high-frequency traders. Due to the unpredictable nature of the market, several different methods are utilised in order to forecast the HFT time series. However none of these methods have been demonstrated to be a consistently acceptable forecast tool. The majority of HFT trading is conducted using traditional arbitrage-based methods.The conventional method of forecasting using time series does not have the capability to take into account seasonality or outliers in a dataset. The HFT time series data is consistently expanding from day to day, thereby becoming big and enormous. To solve this problem, we require a model that is both more precise and less time-consuming. The purpose of this paper work is to investigate historical models, contemporary models and hypothetical future models that can be used to anticipate HFT time series. Within the domain of HFT forecasting where accuracy and productivity are of the utmost importance, it also becomes critical to investigate state-of-the-art technologies. In light of the inherent difficulties that classical computing methods encounter when confronted with the intricacies of time series data, our focus shifts to quantum computing as a prospective resolution. This undertaking is driven by the imperative to confront prevailing obstacles in the field of forecasting, including enhancing precision, managing extensive datasets and alleviating the consequences of noise and uncertainty.The progression of quantum technologies is expected to bring significant changes that will enhance the reliability, precision and scalability of forecasting methodologies. The synergy between quantum computing and HFT forecasting holds the promise of reshaping how we approach and derive insights from time-varying datasets. The exploration and use of quantum computing for HFT forecasting marks a significant stride toward overcoming current limitations. Authors"

For many applications, there is a requirement for processing multiple books, either for the calibration of ABMs or for the training of RL agents. We showcase the first GPU-enabled LOB simulator designed to process thousands of books in parallel, whether for identical or different securities, with an up to 75x faster per-message processing time.

In particular, speculative high-risk high-frequency trading closely resembles disordered gambling behaviour by attracting the same individuals who tend to be overconfident, sensation-seekers, and attracted to quick large potential payoffs. We build on these studies via an incentivised experiment, in which we examine how manipulated levels of market volatility affected trading frequency. Gamblers (N=604) were screened based on the existence of household investments and recruited across the four categories of the Problem Gambling Severity Index. The volatility of stocks was manipulated between-participants (high vs. low). Participants traded fictitious stocks and were provided bonuses based on the results of their trading activity (M=US$4.77, range=[0, 16.99]). Participants traded more often in the high-volatility market, and this finding remained robust after controlling for financial literacy, overconfidence, age, and gender. Many investors trade more frequently than personal finance guides advise, and these results suggest that individuals are more likely to commit this error in more volatile markets. Exploratory analyses suggest that the effect of the volatility manipulation was strongest amongst gamblers who were at low-risk of experiencing gambling harms.

Ethereum, Binance, XRP, Cardano, Monero, Tron, Stellar, and Litecoin, were considered for experimentation across widely used algorithms like Gradient Boosting, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and the like, with different day-length lags ranging up to 4 days. Highly relevant features were selected using Random Forest selection method and highly correlated features have been removed before the modeling. Accuracy for price movement prediction models varied from 71.03% for Ethereum to 66.14% for Stellar, which were better by 15–20% as compared to percentage benchmarking done by literature to be ranging around 50 s and 60 s. For the model validation, sensitivity analysis involving day-wise lag analysis, and different data splits (based on size and months) were considered, which was stable for the high performing models. Further, an interesting result was observed during the study. In order of priority, Bitcoin prices, social media sentiments, and news sentiments significantly impact altcoin price movement. This implies that by studying the Bitcoin price movement and market sentiments, investors can make wise decisions towards altcoin investments.

To ensure the user-perceived deadline at the transport layer, i.e., the network transmission delay and the waiting delay in the send buffer, transmission control scheme plays an important role. While several delay-sensitive transmission control schemes have been proposed, none of them consider the impact of waiting delay in the send buffer. To address this issue, we propose STOP, a joint send buffer and congestion window (CWND) control approach for guaranteeing user-perceived deadline via curriculum-guided deep reinforcement learning. To obtain optimal joint control policy, STOP utilizes a reinforcement learning-based algorithm to jointly adjust the CWND and send buffer with respect to the send buffer state, the network condition and the deadline requirement. Furthermore, to enhance the generalization capability of reinforcement learning-based algorithm, STOP incorporates curriculum learning during the training phase with a difficulty measurer and training scheduler. Extensive experiments in NS-3 indicate that the STOP scheme achieves an overwhelmingly higher average arrival ratio, i.e., around 95% vs. around 0.2%, compared with current prevalent transmission control scheme such as BBR, Cubic and Vegas. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

Market activity measures—logarithmic returns, volume, and transaction number, sampled every 10 s, were divided into intraday and intraweek periods and then further decomposed into recurring and noise components via correlation matrix formalism. The key findings include the distinctive market behavior from traditional stock markets due to the nonexistence of trade opening and closing. This was manifested in three enhanced-activity phases aligning with Asian, European, and U.S. trading sessions. An intriguing pattern of activity surge in 15-min intervals, particularly at full hours, was also noticed, implying the potential role of algorithmic trading. Most notably, recurring bursts of activity in bitcoin and ether were identified to coincide with the release times of significant U.S. macroeconomic reports, such as Nonfarm payrolls, Consumer Price Index data, and Federal Reserve statements. The most correlated daily patterns of activity occurred in 2022, possibly reflecting the documented correlations with U.S. stock indices in the same period. Factors that are external to the inner market dynamics are found to be responsible for the repeatable components of the market dynamics, while the internal factors appear to be substantially random, which manifests itself in a good agreement between the empirical eigenvalue distributions in their bulk and the random-matrix theory predictions expressed by the Marchenko-Pastur distribution.

As the trading volume series is rather irregular, the neural network is considered to tackle the prediction problem. Several questions are pursued, including whether the trading volume could be reasonably predicted using its lags, whether trading volumes of the nearby and first-distant futures could help improve predictions, how complicated the model should be, and whether the model is robust delivering predictions. Our results show that a relatively simple model based upon ten hidden neurons and thirty lags leads to stable and accurate prediction results based on the relative root mean square error measurement.

A natural question is whether it impacted domestic carbon markets. This paper thus presents the event research method on eight carbon emission trading markets in China, because it can timely exhibit the benefits investors gained during the COVID-19 pandemic and also can overcome the difficulty of separating those benefits from the overall performance of the carbon market via high-frequency data. The results herein confirm that China’s carbon market has reacted negatively to the COVID-19 pandemic, which mainly relates to the mandatory blockade and isolation policy adopted by the central government. The production and operation activities of enterprises decreased along with the demand for carbon quotas. Because of the panic, investors also had a negative attitude towards the carbon market, influencing the supply and demand curve of carbon quotas and causing a decline in carbon prices.

Yet, existing methodologies fail to cope with the volatile nature of the emerging DAs. Many models have been proposed to address the unorthodox market dynamics and frequent disruptions in the microstructure caused by the non-stationarity, and peculiar statistics, in DA markets. However, they are either prone to the curse of dimensionality, as additional complexity is required to employ traditional theories, or they overfit historical patterns that may never repeat. Instead, we leverage recent advances in market regime (MR) clustering with the Implied Stochastic Volatility Model (ISVM) on a very recent dataset covering BTC options on the popular trading platform Deribit. Time-regime clustering is a temporal clustering method, that clusters the historic evolution of a market into different volatility periods accounting for non-stationarity. ISVM can incorporate investor expectations in each of the sentiment-driven periods by using implied volatility (IV) data. In this paper, we apply this integrated time-regime clustering and ISVM method (termed MR-ISVM) to high-frequency data on BTC options. We demonstrate that MR-ISVM contributes to overcome the burden of complex adaption to jumps in higher order characteristics of option pricing models. This allows us to price the market based on the expectations of its participants in an adaptive fashion and put the procedure to action on a new dataset covering previously unexplored DA dynamics.  © 2023 Owner/Author."

The expected logarithmic growth (ELG) rate of wealth is used as the objective performance metric. It is known that if the portfolio contains a special asset, the so-called dominant asset, then the optimal ELG level is achieved by investing all available funds in that asset. However, this “all-in” strategy is arguably too risky to implement. As a result, we study the case where the portfolio weights are chosen in a rather ad-hoc manner, and a linear buy-and-hold strategy is subsequently used. We show that if the underlying portfolio contains a dominant asset, buy and hold on that specific asset is asymptotically log-optimal with a logarithmic convergence rate. This result also extends to the scenario when a trader does not have a probabilistic model for returns or does not trust a model based on historical data. Specifically, we prove a version of the one fund theorem, which states that if a market contains a dominant asset, buying and holding a market portfolio with nonzero weights for each asset is asymptotically log-optimal. Additionally, we extend an existing result regarding the property called high-frequency maximality of an ELG-based portfolio from a single asset to a multi-asset portfolio case. This means that, in the absence of transaction costs, high-frequency rebalancing is unbeatable in terms of ELG. This result enables us to further improve the log-optimality obtained previously. Finally, we provide a result on the issue of how often a portfolio should be rebalanced, if needed. Examples using simulations with high-frequency historical trading data are included throughout to illustrate the theory. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

The authors seek to uncover the sources of competitive advantage these firms develop to make markets inefficient for them and enable their survival. Design/methodology/approach: First, the authors review expected capability, a quantitative behavioral model of the sustainable, or reliable, profits that lead to survival. Second, they present qualitative data gathered from semi-structured interviews with industry professionals as well as from the academic and industry literatures. They categorize this data into first-order concepts and themes of opportunity-, advantage- and meta-seeking behaviors. Associating the observed sources of competitive advantages with the components of the expected capability model allows us to describe the economic rationale these firms have for developing those sources and explain how they survive. Findings: The data reveals ten sources of competitive advantages, which the authors label according to known ones in the strategic management literature. We find that, due to the dynamically complex environments and their bounded resources, these firms seek heuristic compromise among these ten, which leads to satisficing. Their application of innovation methodology that prescribes iterative ex post hypothesis testing appears to quell internal conflict among groups and promote organizational survival. The authors believe their results shed light on the behavior and motivations of algorithmic market actors, but also of innovative firms more generally. Originality/value: Based upon their review of the literature, this is the first paper to provide such a complete explanation of the strategic behavior of algorithmic trading firms. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

The limiting behavior of the test statistic is governed by unobservable latent factors in the asset prices. The critical values of the test are constructed on the basis of a novel simulation-based procedure. Empirical implementation of the test to stocks in the S&P 500 index and the five Fama–French factors, as well as the momentum factor, reveals different intraday behavior of the factor loadings: assets’ exposure to size, market and value risks vary systematically over the trading day while the three remaining factors do not exhibit statistically significant intraday variation. Moreover, we find diverse, and for some factors large, reactions in the assets’ factor loadings to major economic or firm specific news releases.

The portfolio is rebalanced every transaction day to optimize asset allocation by incorporating intraday winners or losers’ information and trading cost. The study finds that the proposed models generate positive returns (net of trading costs), in spite of fact that intraday trading frequently erodes profits. The M_Omega and R_Omega models produce a higher return than that of the S&P 500 index or NASDAQ 100 index, considering the intraday trading cost. The performance of the Omega model integrated with the momentum or reversal strategy is more profitable in a volatile market or period.

Second, extreme shocks have a greater impact on intraday return predictability, with most market shocks obliterating the predictive power of first half-hour returns.

The sample includes intraday data from 15 May 2018 until 17 January 2023. The microstructure noise is present until 4 min in the BTC and ETH high-frequency data. Therefore, we opt for a conservative choice with a 60 min sampling frequency. Considering 250 trading days as a rolling-window size, we obtain rolling betas < 1 for Bitcoin and Ethereum with respect to the CRIX market index, which could enhance portfolio diversification (at the expense of maximizing returns). We flag the minimal tracking errors at the hourly and daily frequencies. The dispersion of rolling betas is higher for the weekly frequency and is concentrated towards values of (Formula presented.) > 0.8 for BTC ((Formula presented.) > 0.65 for ETH). The weekly frequency is thus revealed as being less precise for capturing the ‘pure’ systematic risk for Bitcoin and Ethereum. For Ethereum in particular, the availability of high-frequency data tends to produce, on average, a more reliable inference. In the age of financial data feed immediacy, our results strongly suggest to pension fund managers, hedge fund traders, and investment bankers to include ‘realized’ versions of CAPM betas in their dashboard of indicators for portfolio risk estimation. Sensitivity analyses cover jump detection in BTC/ETH high-frequency data (up to 25%). We also include several jump-robust estimators of realized volatility, where realized quadpower volatility prevails. © 2023 by the authors."

Against this background, this paper studied the impact of the new epidemic on the price of Shanghai carbon emission rights and tried to explore the prediction model under the unexpected event. First, because a model based on point value data cannot capture the information hidden in inter-day price fluctuation, based on the interval price of Shanghai carbon emission rights (SHEA) and its influencing factors, an autoregressive conditional interval model with jumping and exogenous variables (ACIXJ) was established to explore the influence of the Russian–Ukrainian conflict and COVID-19 on the interval price of SHEA, respectively. The empirical results show that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine has no obvious influence on the price of SHEA, but COVID-19 led to a decline in the price trend of SHEA over four days before the city was closed, and the volatility changed significantly on the day before the city was closed. The price fluctuation was the strongest within 3 days after the city was closed; In addition, in order to accurately predict the interval data of SHEA against the background of COVID-19, based on the interval data decomposition algorithm (BEMD), a hybrid forecasting model of NDGM-ACIXJ/CNN-LSTM was constructed, in which the discrete gray model of approximate nonhomogeneous exponential series (NDGM) combined with the ACIXJ model is used to predict the high-frequency sub-interval, and the convolution neural network long-term and short-term memory model (CNN-LSTM) is used to predict the low-frequency sub-interval. The empirical results show that the prediction model proposed in this article has higher prediction precision than the reference models (ACIX, ACIXJ, NDGM-ACIXJ, BEMD-ACIX/CNN-LSTM, BEMD-ACIXJ/CNN-LSTM). © 2023 by the authors."

In modern electronically driven markets, traditional time-series econometric methods often appear incapable of capturing the true complexity of the multilevel interactions driving the price dynamics. While recent research has established the effectiveness of traditional machine learning (ML) models in financial applications, their intrinsic inability to deal with uncertainties, which is a great concern in econometrics research and real business applications, constitutes a major drawback. Bayesian methods naturally appear as a suitable remedy conveying the predictive ability of ML methods with the probabilistically oriented practice of econometric research. By adopting a state-of-the-art second-order optimization algorithm, we train a Bayesian bilinear neural network with temporal attention, suitable for the challenging time-series task of predicting mid-price movements in ultra-high-frequency limit-order book markets. We thoroughly compare our Bayesian model with traditional ML alternatives by addressing the use of predictive distributions to analyze errors and uncertainties associated with the estimated parameters and model forecasts. Our results underline the feasibility of the Bayesian deep-learning approach and its predictive and decisional advantages in complex econometric tasks, prompting future research in this direction. © 2023 The Authors.

This led to enhanced research on the impact of private placement on stock prices. In 2012, the Chinese government relaxed the requirements for directed issuance of listed companies, resulting in a surge of directed issuance since then. This study uses a sample of listed companies that conducted private placements in the A-share market between 2013 and 2021, to analyze the impact of investor sentiment on stock price differences after private placements from the perspective of short and long-term excess returns. This study constructs the non-main investor sentiment of individual stocks using high-frequency tick data of individual stocks and explores the relationship between this stock price anomaly and investor sentiment using multiple regression analysis. The results show a positive short-term announcement effect of A-share private placements, with the excess return rate occurring mainly before the plan announcement date. The stock price difference from the plan announcement date to ten trading days thereafter has a significantly negative relationship with the excess return rate. Furthermore, investor sentiment in private placements may negatively affect long-term stock performance. This study suggests that this phenomenon is caused by higher investor sentiment pushing stock prices upward in the short term, causing them to deviate from fundamentals, creating mispricing, and then driving them back to fundamentals, with information disclosure. After controlling for the severity of information disclosure, the effect of investor sentiment on long-term stock price performance becomes insignificant. © Fuji Technology Press Ltd."

This paper studies the liquidity provision of HFMMs during high volatility periods when adverse selection is high. I find that, consistent with empirical evidence, HFMMs quote narrow spreads even when volatility is high, but they are not always present at the narrow spreads. Unlike traditional intermediaries, HFMMs manage adverse selection costs by decreasing the volume traded at the narrow spread. HFMMs effectively price discriminate between uninformed and informed investors by reducing the cross-subsidization from uninformed investors to informed investors. As a result, uninformed investors pay a lower effective spread than informed investors. HFMMs improve market liquidity and increase gains from trade especially when adverse selection is high. A policy to limit HFMMs’ speed is a double-edged sword. © 2023 Elsevier Inc."

The novelty is that, under sparsity conditions on the true model, we do not need to impose any model penalty or parameters shrinkage, unlike Lasso. The procedure allows us to derive a central limit theorem to test restrictions in a two-stage estimator. We achieve this by the use of a sign constraint on the intensity which necessarily needs to be positive. In particular, we introduce an additive model to extract the nonlinear impact of order book variables on buy and sell trade arrivals. In the empirical application, we show that the shape and dynamics of the order book are fundamental in determining the arrival of buy and sell trades in the crude oil futures market. We establish our empirical results mapping the covariates into a higher-dimensional space. Consistently with the theoretical results, the estimated models are sparse in the number of parameters. Using this approach, we are also able to compare competing model hypotheses on the basis of an out-of-sample likelihood ratio type of test. © 2022 The Author(s)."

Following increased trade-time clustering, we observe more aggressive orders from informed traders, but less high-frequency trading in stable markets. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

Many of the executions that were previously performed manually are now automated. Despite electronic algorithms growing relative to human action, there have been few controlled laboratory experiments dedicated to studying the interactions between human traders and automated trading agents (“robots”). Thus, this paper provides important insights and summarizes the valuable contribution made by experimental studies in extending the knowledge on financial markets, particularly automated trading strategies. It should be noted that human investors make slightly smaller profits than robots, except for robots that operate at a slower speed and do not operate during periods of greater market instability. In addition, this study finds that faster and more sophisticated trading algorithms can resort to market manipulation strategies and consequently reduce market efficiency. Further, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no scientific contributions (namely, laboratory experiments) that have evaluated the cognitive and behavioral biases in human–robot interactions. Our study opens up a new horizon to explore by serving as the starting point in a new direction for future research.

Lower latency provides capacity for traders to position themselves to take liquidity when it is cheap. After the second upgrade in 2010 (launch of ASX Trade), the harmful effect reverses. Our evidence shows that in large-capitalisation stocks, algorithmic trading/high-frequency trading provides liquidity and stabilises the price when short-term volatility is high.

The carbon price possesses the features of nonlinearity, non-stationarity, and high complexity as a time series. To overcome the negative impact of these characteristics on prediction and to improve the prediction accuracy of carbon price series, a combination prediction model named Lp-CNN-LSTM, which utilizes both convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory networks, has been proposed. Strategy one involved establishing distinct models of CNN-LSTM and LSTM to analyze high-frequency and low-frequency carbon price sequences; the combination of output was integrated to predict carbon prices more precisely. Strategy two comprehensively considered the economic and technical indicators of carbon price sequences based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, while the Multi-CNN-LSTM model selected explanatory variables that strongly correlated with carbon prices. Finally, a predictive model for a combination of carbon prices was developed using Lp-norm. The empirical study focused on China’s major carbon markets, including Hubei, Guangdong, and Shanghai. According to the error indicators, the performance of the Lp-CNN-LSTM model was superior to individual strategy prediction models. The Lp-CNN-LSTM model has excellent accuracy, superiority, and robustness in predicting carbon prices, which can provide a necessary basis for revising carbon pricing strategies, regulating carbon trading markets, and making investment decisions. © 2023 by the authors."

The ability of Transformer to capture long-range dependencies and interactions makes it possible to apply it in the field of portfolio management (PM). However, the built-in quadratic complexity of the Transformer prevents its direct application to the PM task. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based PM framework called LSRE-CAAN, with two important components: a long sequence representations extractor and a cross-asset attention network. Direct Policy Gradient is used to solve the sequential decision problem in the PM process. We conduct numerical experiments in three aspects using four different cryptocurrency datasets, and the empirical results show that our framework is more effective than both traditional and state-of-the-art (SOTA) online portfolio strategies, achieving a 6x return on the best dataset. In terms of risk metrics, our framework has an average volatility risk of 0.46 and an average maximum drawdown risk of 0.27 across the four datasets, both of which are lower than the vast majority of SOTA strategies. In addition, while the vast majority of SOTA strategies maintain a poor turnover rate of approximately greater than 50% on average, our framework enjoys a relatively low turnover rate on all datasets, efficiency analysis illustrates that our framework no longer has the quadratic dependency limitation. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

The model utilizes a temporal attention-augmented bilinear layer (TABL) and a temporal convolutional network (TCN) to denoise the data. In addition, a prediction transformer module captures the dependency between time series. A differential layer is proposed and incorporated into the model to extract information from the messy and chaotic high-frequency LOB time series. This layer can identify the fine distinction between adjacent slices in the series. We evaluate the proposed model on several datasets. On the open LOB benchmark FI-2010, our model outperforms other comparative state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and F1 score.

For this purpose, it is essential to apply a trading method that is capable of fast and accurate prediction from such time-series data. In this paper, we developed an online time series forecasting method for high-frequency trading (HFT) by integrating three neural network deep learning models, i.e., long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and transformer; and we abbreviate the new method to online LGT or O-LGT. The key innovation underlying our method is its efficient storage management, which enables super-fast computing. Specifically, when computing the forecast for the immediate future, we only use the output calculated from the previous trading data (rather than the previous trading data themselves) together with the current trading data. Thus, the computing only involves updating the current data into the process. We evaluated the performance of O-LGT by analyzing high-frequency limit order book (LOB) data from the Chinese market. It shows that, in most cases, our model achieves a similar speed with a much higher accuracy than the conventional fast supervised learning models for HFT. However, with a slight sacrifice in accuracy, O-LGT is approximately 12 to 64 times faster than the existing high-accuracy neural network models for LOB data from the Chinese market. © 2023 by the authors."

In this paper, we first decompose the nonstationary high-frequency financial time series through the variational mode decomposition (VMD), then construct the traditional autoregressive moving average (ARIMA) model on the trend and periodic items to capture the characteristics of the high-frequency series, construct a deep learning long short-term memory (LSTM) model on the disturbance item to fit the nonlinear trend of the data, and finally reconstruct the decomposed series by multiple linear regression. Through the Monte Carlo simulation and empirical data, it is found that under various evaluation criteria, the VMD-LSTM model is more accurate in forecasting the nonstationary high-frequency financial data with jumps, compared with the single ARIMA model, machine learning, and deep learning model. The VMD-LSTM model has reduced 21.74%, 94.69%, and 48.57% on the mean absolute error (MAE) of forecasting compared with other models such as the ARIMA model, machine learning, and deep learning model.

To do this, a stick-breaking Gaussian mixture model is applied to com-pensate for the return distribution over both time and price dimensions. For the fit-ting of model parameters, the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method is applied to obtain the stick-breaking Gaussian mixture model parameters that maximize a posteriori probability. Once the posterior distribution is obtained, we draw samples from it to compute the standard deviation and construct the realized local volatility surface to within a 95% credible interval. Then, a numerical experiment result using ticker-level high-frequency data for Tesla, Inc. is used to construct a hypothetical realized local volatility surface.

In addition, the trading strategies of their trading models were generally designed to be less sophisticated, and their prediction models lacked interpretability. To fill these gaps, a price direction fused prediction and trading approach has been proposed for high-frequency prediction of the Chinese crude oil futures. In the proposed approach, the MTXGBoost (Multiple Timeframes eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is developed and utilized for predictions fusion under multiple timeframes, and the NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II) is integrated for trading strategy optimization. Moreover, the SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanation) approach is also employed to interpret how the proposed approach made predictions.

Thus, the topic of crude oil price prediction has drawn significant attention from market participants and researchers. In this study, we propose an intelligent trading decision support system called FRS-NSGA-II-SW, which integrates the Fuzzy Rough Set (FRS), Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II), and Sliding Window (SW), for high-frequency price direction prediction and simulated trading of the crude oil futures in the Chinese market. Additionally, a Japanese technical indicator Ichimoku KinkoHyo is employed to extract features of high-frequency movement for the proposed model. To assess the performance comprehensively, four evaluation measures, including hit ratio, accumulated return, maximum drawdown, and Sharpe ratio, are employed to investigate the performances of the proposed method and benchmark methods. As a result, the proposed approach produced an average hit ratio of 66.84%, an average accumulated return of 20.39%, an average maximum drawdown of 8.38%, and a Sharpe ratio of 1.22, which outperformed all the benchmark methods. Additionally, Friedman test results indicate that the proposed method significantly outperformed the benchmark methods in terms of prediction accuracy and profit-making ability. Furthermore, experimental results show that integrating the Multi-objective optimization algorithm NSGA-II and the dynamic learning method SW successfully enhanced the performance of the proposed method. The excellent performance of the proposed method demonstrates that it could be applied as an intelligent trading decision support system for market investors and regulators in the Chinese crude oil futures market. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

This is a single market serial trading with the disadvantages of asymmetric information, insufficient competition, and weak price discovery function. This paper proposes a three-platform parallel trading mechanism, which regards the process of market trading as a price seeking process. On the basis of the traditional trading platform, i.e. exchange platform, two new sub-platforms, namely, the buying platform and the selling platform, form a three-platform architecture together with the traditional exchange platform and all of them belong to the same trading system. A market subject is endowed with the dual identities of both the searcher and the bidder. In one trading system and one trading time window, the subject can carry out transactions in parallel: as a searcher, it organizes the transactions on the price seeking platform in accordance with the trading rules published in advance and is responsible for the market clearing, or it participates in the market transactions organized by the other searchers or trading institutions as a bidder. The market entity may adjust the price seeking or quotation information according to its own power generation cost or power utilization efficiency and the dynamic market conditions so as to obtain more trading initiative. By elaborating the transaction principle and clearing mechanism of the three-platform parallel transaction architecture, a unified standardized clearing model covering the current single market serial transaction is constructed. Taking the centralized trading as an example, through simulation and comparison with the existing trading mechanisms, the results show that the three-platform parallel trading mechanism has significant advantages in improving the transaction rate, increasing the transaction electricity, ensuring the maximization of social welfare, and reducing market power. © 2023 Power System Technology Press.

We find that the trading volume could be predicted using one to thirty minutes ahead data through a relatively low complex model with five hidden neurons based on its own lags, resulting in generally accurate and stable performance based on the relative root mean square error.

Using the neural network method to describe the nonlinear characteristics of volatility can further improve the out-of-sample prediction accuracy of the model. The Lasso-NN-J model has the best in-sample and out-sample prediction performance among all the investigated forecasting models, and the prediction performance of the model is quite robust under the simulation tests of different rolling window widths, different high-frequency data of individual stocks and random sampling. © 2024 Chinese Chemical Society.

We then feed the outputs of multiple GARCH models into an LSTM network, creating a hybrid model that leverages the strengths of both approaches. The predicted volatility from the hybrid model is used to generate trading strategy signals, which are subsequently used to build an investment strategy. Empirical analysis using the China Securities Index 300 (CSI300) dataset demonstrates that the hybrid model significantly improves value-at-risk (VaR) prediction performance compared to traditional GARCH models.

Considering the pandemic effect, this paper established an integrated system to identify the relationship trajectories between carbon trading market and impact factors. A noise-assisted multivariate empirical mode decomposition (N-A MEMD) method was utilized to simultaneously decompose the original multi-dimensional time series into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), after which the Lempel-Ziv (LZ) complexity algorithm was applied to reconstruct the IMFs into high-frequency (HF), low-frequency (LF), and trend modules. Vector autoregression (VAR) and vector error correction (VEC) models were then used to systematically simulate the correlations. The time span was split into pre-COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 periods for comparison, and the mobility trends data during the outbreak period released by the Apple company was chosen to reflect the pandemic effects. The empirical analysis results revealed the energy prices, macroeconomic index, and exchange rate are the main external impact factors of carbon price in the short term. Summarizing from the cointegration models over the long term, the market stability reserve (MSR) mechanism was found to have ability on stabilizing the carbon price under the epidemic shock.

While a national carbon trading market that covers the electricity sector has been established, its effectiveness depends on how this sector evolves into being a more integrated market. This study evaluated the impact of China's electricity market integration on the cost-effectiveness of carbon pricing. An integrated (regional electricity market) and a segmented (provincial electricity market) market scenario were used to identify possible reform paths going forward. Using high-frequency datasets of the five southern provinces in 2018, we assessed the impact of electricity market integration on the abatement potential and cost-effectiveness of carbon pricing. We found that carbon prices need to be as high as 200 yuan/ton to begin achieving overall carbon reduction. In this context, the regional market is more cost-effective in reducing emissions than the provincial one, as the abatement costs are saved by around 60% compared to the latter under the same emission reduction targets. However, the regional market may also raise potential equity issues. The provincial-level distribution of carbon emission reductions, as well as the withdrawal of coal power, are more concentrated in the regional market than in the provincial one, which indicates an inequitable social-economic-environmental impacts of market integration. Our research findings would help to improve policymakers' understanding of the interaction between carbon pricing and electricity market reforms. This would then assist them in coordinating an effective design of both the carbon and electricity markets, in addition to supporting China's carbon neutrality target. © 2023 Elsevier Inc."

According to the theoretical framework proposed by Chen et al. (2005), the ratio of call/put trading values is calculated every minute in order to estimate the probability ratio of the index increasing versus decreasing. Then, we implement the indicator-following trading strategy, which buys the index when the benchmark call/put ratio increases more than the pre-defined sensitivity threshold and sells the index when the benchmark call/put ratio decreases more than the sensitivity. Using the calculated daily returns of the indicator-following trading, we test whether the indicator-following trading strategy significantly outperforms the simple buy-hold strategy that takes a long position on the index at the beginning of the market and clears the position when the market closes for each day. If returns of indicator-following trading are significantly larger than the returns of the buy-hold strategy, the empirical results can support the hypothesis that information is disseminated from the KOSPI200 options market to the stock index market, and the call/put ratio can be treated as a predictive information variable. By controlling various environments of indicator-following trading, we investigate market conditions for maximizing the price discovery effect of our information variables: trading timing, trading sensitivity, volatility of the index, time to maturity of the option, and call/put ratios for different moneyness. In addition, we compare the return predictability of our information variables to the call/put option trading volume ratio, take account of transaction costs, and examine the effect of lowering the trading multiplier of the KOSPI200 option. The results of our study are as follows. First, the indicator-following trading on the total call/put ratio exhibits significantly higher returns than the returns of the buy-hold strategy by 18bp on average per day with the corresponding t-statistic of 7.8, which supports the price discovery feature of our information variable for the KOSPI200 index. Also, the return predictability remains effective for a minute under a 1% significance level. Further, we numerically verify the existence of the local maximum point whose sensitivity maximizes the average return per trading of the indicator-following strategy. As the existence of the local maximum is consistent with the theoretical prediction, the underlying theoretical framework could be justified. Second, the return predictability extends to 2 minutes for the call/put trading value ratio on the at-the-money option, which implies that the persistence of the price discovery stems from the trading information of the at-the-money option. The argument is supported by additional empirical tests under different moneyness ranges. Moreover, the shorter the remaining maturity of the option and the greater the volatility of the stock index is, the stronger the price discovery effect becomes. Third, comparing the returns of indicator-following trading, the return predictability of the call/put trading value ratio is superior to the call/put trading volume ratio used in the existing literature. Fourth, when considering actual transaction costs, the indicator-following trading strategy does not generate excess returns, which indicates efficient and immediate information delivery between the actual option market and the stock index market. Lastly, lowering the trading multiplier of the KOSPI200 option improves only the trading performance of the trading strategy using the out-of-the-money options, and we interpret that the policy hinders the efficiency of the out-of-the-money option market. Our study contributes to the strands of literature spanning the market microstructure between the KOSPI200 option market and stock index market, the high-frequency trading, and the policy of the Korean option market. By demonstrating the distinguished and superior return predictability of the call/put option trading value ratio compared to the counterpart of trading volume, we argue that the information can flow from the index option market to the stock index market. That is, our results shed light on the unresolved debate on the direction of the information flow between those two markets. Including the significant persistence of the return predictability of the call/put trading value ratio, various empirical findings under different trading conditions support that the KOSPI200 option market leads the stock index market. Meanwhile, we highlight the importance of using high-frequency data because implementing the high-frequency trading strategy allows us to estimate more precise persistence of return predictability than prior research. Additionally, complementing the extant research reaching conflicting conclusions on the effectiveness of lowering the trading multiplier of the KOSPI200 options, identifying the effect of the policy with the indicator-following trading strategy on call/put trading volume ratio enables us to support the partial efficacy of the policy. © 2023, Korean Finance Association.

We identify the good/bad news using a combination of sign restrictions with high-frequency financial data. ""Bad news""events are times when the market interpreted the Fed decisions/announcements as revealing negative Fed information about the economy, and vice versa for ""good news""events. A novel finding is that following bad news events, we observe significantly positive stock returns in a 20-day period. This observation is largely consistent with a story of asymmetric effects of good and bad news on the level of uncertainty. Further analysis shows that the post-FOMC drift to economic news in Fed announcements is a market-wide phenomenon.

(2) The exchange rate had a significant risk connectedness with gold and international crude oil, but a restrict connectedness with domestic crude oil after the outbreak. These variations of risk transmission caused by the pandemic emerged later than the outbreak, reflecting a certain lag. (3) The impact of the pandemic on the asymmetric risk connectedness between oil, gold and the exchange rate was limited, and the risk transfer resulting from bad news was dominant during the sample period; however, gold was less affected by bad news than the oil and exchange rates.

In concrete terms, it examines a variant of high-frequency trading that is all about speed—low-latency trading—in light of moral issues surrounding arbitrage, information asymmetries, and systemic risk. The essay focuses on low-latency trading and the role of speed because it also aims to show that the commonly made assumption that speed in financial markets is morally neutral is wrong. For instance, speed is a necessary condition for low-latency trading’s potential to cause harm in “flash crashes.” On the other hand, it also plays a crucial role in a Lockean defense against low-latency trading being wasteful developed in this essay. Finally, this essay discusses the implications of these findings for related high-frequency trading techniques like futures arbitrage or latency arbitrage—as well as for an argument as to why quote stuffing is wrong. Overall, the qualifications offered in this essay act as a counterbalance to overblown claims about trading at high speeds being wrong. © 2022, The Author(s)."

Using high-frequency transaction data, trading intensity is measured by price duration and incorporated in the class of heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) models. Results provide compelling evidence that trading intensity improves the forecasting performance of a highly competitive set of HAR models, commonly used in the literature. HAR extensions that incorporate price duration systematically deliver the lowest forecast errors and generate economically significant gains in volatility targeting exercise over multiple horizons. However, results show no evidence in favor of a unique duration-augmented model. The predictive ability of price duration is supported by a number of robustness checks, including alternative estimation windows, bull and bear market states, and alternative thresholds that define price events. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Compared with the traditional two-phase approach, forecasting equity's trend and then weighting them by combinatorial optimization, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have shown advances in reward chasing with optimal policies. However, existing DRL-based methods either leverage portfolio optimization on low-frequency scenarios or only support a very limited number of assets with discrete action space, facing significant computing efficiency challenges. Therefore, we propose an efficient DRL-based policy optimization (DRPO) method for high-frequency trading. In particular, we model the portfolio management task with Markov Decision Process by directly inferring the equity weights in the action space guided by maximum accumulated returns. To reduce agents' interaction complexity without reducing interpretation, we detach the environment into the ""static'' market states and ""dynamic'' portfolio weight states. Then, we design an efficient reward expectation calculation algorithm via probabilistic dynamic programming, which enables our agents directly collect feedback away from trajectory sampling-based morass. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that solves the high-frequency portfolio optimization problem by devising an efficient continuous space policy optimization algorithm in the DRL framework. Through extensive experiments on the real-world data from Dow Jones, Coinbase and SSE exchanges, we show that our proposed DRPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art benchmark methods. The results demonstrate the practical applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method.  © 2023 ACM."

It is a market mechanism aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions and carbon dioxide emissions. Blockchain technology can be applied to the carbon-trading scenario using characteristics that guarantee the security, decentralization, data immutability, and data traceability of the carbon-trading process. It would be difficult to implement carbon trading on blockchains for all enterprises and individuals, as the current performance of blockchains does not meet the requirements. There has been extensive research conducted on blockchain performance optimization, and the off-chain payment channel is one of the more mature solutions. This approach involves the transfer of transactions to off-chain transactions, thus avoiding high transaction fees. Existing research has addressed the problem of routing security and efficiency, with less emphasis on factors such as routing transaction costs, node reputation, and routing path considerations. This paper researches the optimization of payment routing in Payment Channel Networks (PCNs) and proposes the Multi-Factor Routing Payment Scheme (MFPS), which integrates factors such as the node reputation, transaction fee cost, and distance to select the route for payment transactions. In order to improve the success ratio of routing transactions, the transaction-splitting algorithm is proposed. To ensure the security and privacy of the transaction process, the Asymmetric Time-Lock Contract (ATLC) protocol is proposed. The results of extensive experimental simulations show that the MFPS proposed in this paper outperforms the ShortestPath, Cheapest, and SplitDistance algorithms. It achieves an approximately 13.8%∼49% improvement in the transaction success ratio and reduces the average transaction processing cost. The security and privacy measures can defend against wormhole and double-flower attacks and exhibit better performance in terms of computational verification and message overhead. © 2023 by the authors."

MSE-based single image super-resolution (SISR) algorithms, such as SRResNet do not deliver perceptually sharp images, but maximizes PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio). Edge details are often lost in such algorithms. A variant of SRResNet based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) model, named SRGAN, aims at achieving higher perceptual sharpness by trading in PSNR. This drop in PSNR is often massive and is attributed to the occurrence of unwanted artifacts. We introduce EaSRGAN, an edge-aware generative adversarial network, which reduces artifacts, delivers highly sharp and photorealistic images with PSNR values better than SRGAN. EaSRGAN treats high frequency regions separately from flat regions which brings in awareness of edges in the super-resolution output. Combined with a multi-stage training process separate for edge and flat areas, these loss functions make the generator and the discriminator, ‘edge-aware’. We compare our results with state-of-the-art SISR algorithms. EaSRGAN delivers superior perceptual clarity like that of SRGAN, while maintaining high PSNR by attenuating artifacts. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

We discuss two methods for defining events, one based on the asset price, and the other based on both price and volume of the asset. We construct durations based on these two definitions, and apply models to tick-by-tick data for assets traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

The aim of the study is to examine the level of awareness among the brokers when integrated with technology for the purpose of executing the trades. Design/Methodology: A self-administered and structured 350 questionnaires were designed and circulated to collect the preliminary information from the stock brokers operating in NSE and BSE within the geographical limits of Bangalore district using the Systematic Sampling method to obtain a sample size of 235. Awareness, Automated trading, Elimination of human error, portfolio management, tracking order, order placement were the critical variables observed to validate the hypothesis using Simple Percentage Analysis & Chi-Square Analysis using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS). Findings: It was found that there is robust association between the level of awareness of the mentioned technology in its application by the stock brokers of NSE and BSE operating in Bangalore. Portfolio management and automated trading are the highly associated application of Algorithmic trading among the stock brokerage services. Originality: Algorithmic trading makes use of complex formulas, combined with mathematical models and human oversight, to make decisions to buy or sell financial securities on an exchange.

Challenging this perception, this study explores the possibility that computerized systems reflect the individual characteristics of the developers who have designed and realized them. Through the analysis of interviews with high-frequency trading system developers and a survey of software developers working in diverse industries, it shows that developers’ characteristics, which have been related to bounded rationality (e.g. experience and expertise), influence their codes’ performance and errors. Computer codes also reflect the personal circumstances of the developers (e.g. deadlines and stress), and their values. However, whereas some developers value code characteristics that are congruent with the ideal of unbounded rationality, including speed and accuracy, others aim to achieve characteristics that could be incongruent with it (e.g. code readability and modularity). Developers’ roles and organizational practices, such as testing procedures and code reviews, limit the expression of their characteristics in their codes. Nevertheless, developers can be often identified by reading the codes. Highlighting that developers transfer some of their characteristics to their codes, this study identifies elements of bounded rationality in decision-making systems and extends organizational decision-making research. © 2022 The Authors.

We derive the expected log-utility of wealth, which allows us to estimate the optimal allocation parameters. The algorithm using our MGMA strategy is also presented. As the multiple risky assets can have different variability levels and could have various degrees of correlations, this trading strategy is evaluated on both simulated data and global high-frequency exchange-traded fund (ETF) data.

Traders in the spot market can hedge certain risks through the futures market. With the development of the futures market, the arbitrage transactions around futures have attracted increasingly attention. The aim of this paper is to establish an innovative and unique pairs trading framework, and use it to test the effectiveness of China's futures market. The framework for pairs trading is based on cointegration test, Kalman filter and Hurst index filtering. We use the data of 47 commodities with relatively good liquidity in the Chinese commodity futures market. We apply the representative index of China's commodity futures market, ""Wenhua Commodity Index"" as the benchmark, to evaluate the performance of the strategy and compare it with the benchmark model. This study found that, according to the pairs trading framework, after considering transaction costs, the cumulative return in the sample reached 81%, the cumulative return out of the sample was 21%. It is worth noting that the out-of-sample maximum drawdown achieved excellent results of no more than 1%. In the same period, trading the Wenhua Commodity Index with a ""buy and hold"" strategy achieved a gain of 31%, but with maximum drawdown reached 15%. The values of our paper are, first it proves that Chinese commodity futures market is not a weak-form efficient market, because technical analysis based on machine learning could obtain excess returns.

However, the classical Markowitz model, which was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1991, faces new challenges in contemporary financial environments. Specifically, it fails to consider transaction costs and cardinality constraints, which have become increasingly critical factors, particularly in the era of high-frequency trading. To address these limitations, this research is motivated by the successful application of machine learning tools in various engineering disciplines. In this work, three novel dynamic neural networks are proposed to tackle nonconvex portfolio optimization under the presence of transaction costs and cardinality constraints. The neural dynamics are intentionally designed to exploit the structural characteristics of the problem, and the proposed models are rigorously proven to achieve global convergence. To validate their effectiveness, experimental analysis is conducted using real stock market data of companies listed in the Dow Jones Index (DJI), covering the period from November 8, 2021 to November 8, 2022, encompassing an entire year.

By establishing a short-term network tariff model and dynamic adjustment mechanism for long-term interactive operation of distributed trading and distribution networks, this paper aims to effectively promote the transformation of the operation and cost recovery methods of distribution networks under the new energy structure. First, based on the additional short-term operation costs of P2P trading on the grid, this paper establishes a P2P trading network tariff model with three parts: line occupation cost, voltage adjustment cost and network loss cost, and adopts continuous two-way auction to match the trading aggregation for P2P trading with small volume, high frequency and real-time characteristics, and then further designs a dynamic network tariff update and adjustment model considering line utilization and incremental cost. At the same time, a quotation and quantity strategy adjustment model for electricity purchasing and selling users participating in P2P trading has been established. Based on the Vensim DSS platform and MATLAB software, a long time-scale joint interaction simulation is conducted. The case analysis shows that the proposed dynamic network tariff can release stronger price signals to stimulate the power flow distribution of P2P trading on the less utilized lines, while discouraging the higher utilized lines from generating more net power flow increments to achieve the effect of“low promotion and high suppression”and realize the effective utilization of network assets. Moreover, network tariff charging will not harm users’enthusiasm to participate in P2P trading for a long period of time in the future. Therefore, it can promote the benign synergistic development of distributed trading and distribution network, and realize the win-win situation of distribution network users and public distribution network operators. © 2023 Automation of Electric Power Systems Press.

FBAs have been proposed to mitigate against the ill-effects of High-Frequency Trading (HFT) systems which trade at super-human speeds. In this paper we report on simulation studies of automated trading in FBA-based financial markets: we have extended a long-established open-source simulation model of a CDA market to also allow FBA-based trading; after that, we adapted existing automated trading algorithms initially designed for CDA-based markets so that they could work usefully in the FBA-based exchange. As far as we know, this is the first paper to be published on the extension of these automated trading algorithms to operate on a FBA-based exchange. By conducting more than 1.7M simulation experiments, we examine the pairwise dominance relationships of six well-known trading algorithms, evaluating each A/B pair of algorithms across a range of different ratios of A:B. Our research hypothesis was that the profitability of the minimally-simple SHVR trading algorithm, ‘a tongue-in-cheek model of contemporary high-frequency trading’, would decline significantly due to FBAs being designed to curb the advantage of HFTs. The results of our simulation studies reveal that, surprisingly, a minor modification of SHVR was able to maintain profitability in short batch intervals. In fact, we show here that in FBAs SHVR dominates both AA and GDX, two well-known trading algorithms that have previously been proven to out-perform human traders. Further to this, we show here that the dominance hierarchy of CDA trading algorithms first established in a paper published at EMSS2020 was disrupted by the switch to FBAs: surprisingly, the algorithm GVWY rose to the top of the hierarchy, demonstrating an unexpected effectiveness in the FBA.

By comparing a variety of regression models that associate various measures of market liquidity with measures of high-frequency activity on the same dataset, we find that for some models the increase in high-frequency activity improves market liquidity, but for others, we get the opposite effect. We indicate that this ambiguity does not depend only on the stock market or the data period, but also on the used HFT measure: the increase of high-frequency orders leads to lower market liquidity whereas the increase in high-frequency trades improves liquidity. We hypothesize that the observed decrease in market liquidity associated with an increasing level of high-frequency orders is caused by a rise in quote volatility. © 2023 The Author(s)"

In order to react within microseconds, high-frequency traders depend on specialized low latency infrastructure and fast connections to exchanges, which require significant IT investments. The paper investigates a technical failure of this infrastructure at a major exchange that prevents high-frequency traders from trading at low latency. This event provides a unique opportunity to analyze the impact of high-frequency trading on securities markets. The analysis clearly shows that although the impact on trading volume and the number of trades is marginal, the effects on liquidity and to a lesser extent on price volatility are substantial when high-frequency trading is interrupted. Thus, investments in high-frequency trading technology provide positive economic spillovers to the overall market since they reduce transaction costs not only for those who invest in this technology but for all market participants by enhancing the quality of securities markets. © 2022, The Author(s)."

The existing STP approaches only use market data with the same granularity (such as daily market data). However, in the actual financial investment, there are a large number of more detailed investment signals contained in finer-grained data (e.g, high- frequency data). This motivates us to research how to leverage multi-granularity market data to capture more useful information and improve the accuracy in the task of STP. However, the effective utilization of multi-granularity data presents a major challenge. Firstly, the iteration of multi-granularity data with time will lead to more complex noise, which makes it difficult to identify and extract it. Secondly, the difference in granularity may lead to opposite target trends in the same time interval. Thirdly, the target trends of stocks with similar features can be quite different, and different sizes of granularity will aggravate this gap. In order to address the above three challenges, in this paper, we present a self-supervised framework of multi-granularity denoising contrast learning (MDC). Specifically, we construct a dynamic dictionary of memory, which can obtain clear and unified representations by filtering noise and aligning multi- granularity data. Moreover, we design two contrast learning objectives to solve the differences in trends by constructing additional self-supervised signals. Extensive experiments on the CSI 300 datasets show that our framework stands out from the existing top-level systems and has excellent profitability in real investing scenarios. © 2023 IEEE."

However, in the meantime, some classical financial characteristics have striking similarities. Therefore, an increasing amount of investors are dedicated to finding and making the most of reasonable models with computer science and machine learning, in quest of a general pattern. Accordingly, we developed a comprehensive model to help some traders with optimal transaction decisions. Given that the portfolio of cash, bitcoin and gold is gradually becoming a new choice for high returns, we chose these assets as examples to build a model to forecast the closing prices of bitcoin and gold for the next trading day based on their past stream up to today with LSTM (LongShort Term Memory) Neural Network Model. To achieve the maximum return, we used the Mean-variance Model to set the investment ratio of bitcoin and gold as variables for mathematical programming and solved the multivariate equations to find the optimal portfolio. The investment weights for each trade were obtained by comparing the lowest risk portfolio and the optimal return portfolio, i.e., the minimum variance and maximum Sharpe ratio scenarios. Finally, we evaluated our strategy through quantitative strategy indices and proved its outstanding performance. © 2023 IEEE."

It still remains unclear how to exploit deep learning techniques to improve high-frequency trading (HFT). Indeed, there are two emerging challenges for the use of deep learning for HFT: (i) how to quantify fast-changing market conditions for tick-level signal prediction; (ii) how to establish a unified trading paradigm for different securities of diverse market conditions and severe signal sparsity. To this end, in this paper, we propose an <italic>Online Adaptive Sequence Learning</italic> (LEVER) framework, which consists of two distinct components to predict the HFT signals at the tick level for a variety of securities simultaneously. Specifically, we start with a single learner that adopts an encoder-decoder architecture for each security-based HFT signal prediction. In this single learner, an ordered encoder module first captures the variability patterns of the security&#x0027;s price curve by encoding the input indicator sequence from different time ranges. An unordered decoder module then outlines the pivot points of the price curve as support and resistance levels to quantify the market status. Based on the measured market condition, a prediction module further approximates the impacts of upcoming security data as the potential market momentum to detect the tick-level trading signals. To overcome the computational challenges and signal sparsity posed by online HFT for multiple securities, we develop a competitive active-meta learning paradigm to enhance the signal learners&#x0027; learning efficiency for online implementation. Finally, extensive experiments on real-world stock market data demonstrate the effectiveness of our deployed LEVER for improving the performances of the existing industry method by 0.27&#x00A0;in the Sharpe ratio and by 0.09&#x0025; in a transaction-based return.

We utilize the realized covariance (RCOV) and realized correlation coefficient based on high-frequency data to measure the daily return correlation between CSI 300 index futures and the spot. Then we establish the RCOV-Wishart-HAR model as well as MVGARCH models to assess the hedging efficiency of CSI 300 index futures among different market status. The empirical results show that the return correlation between index futures and the spot decreases during the abnormal fluctuation, and is severely affected by the stringent trading restrictions. The hedging efficiency decreases during 2015 abnormal fluctuation, but there is still more than 70% systematic risk hedged by index futures. Moreover, hedging is most cost-efficiency during abnormal fluctuation. The strict trading restrictions result in negative impact on the intraday correlation between IF and spot return, thus the hedging performance becomes worse than that of steady period before the crash. As partial release of trading restrictions in recent years, the hedging efficiency increases but the hedging cost is still higher than that during the steady period before restriction implementation. The empirical results indicate that the hedging function of index futures works well during 2015 abnormal fluctuation, and is negatively impacted by strict trading restrictions. Therefore, it is necessary to release the trading restrictions in order to improve the risk management performance of index futures. © 2023 Systems Engineering Society of China. All rights reserved."

The model examines the dynamics of midpoint pegged order queues and finds their steady states. It shows how messaging delays can protect pegged orders and improve investor welfare, but typically increase queuing costs. Recently available field data show that the empirical distribution of queued pegged orders is highly leptokurtotic and resembles the discrete Laplace distribution predicted by the model.

We show that this linear version exhibits all types of price behavior, just like the nonlinear version, while also having the benefit of being explicitly integrable even with time-varying parameters.

This method extracts the extreme value points of time series, identifies the important points in time series quickly and accurately, and compresses them. Experimental results show that, compared with the discrete Fourier transform and wavelet transform, the proposed method can effectively process data of different granularity and different trends on the basis of fully preserving the original information of time series.

Nearly all areas of machine learning (ML) have been tested as solutions to generate a truly accurate predictive model. The accuracy of most models hovers around 50%, highlighting the need for further increases in precision, data handling, forecasting, and ultimately prediction.In this paper we present the result of our work on high-frequency (every fifteen minutes) stock-price prediction using technical data with a number of exogenous variables. These variables are carefully chosen to reflect the conventional wisdom in a traditional stock analysis on historical trend, general stock market condition, and interest rate movement. Several simple machine learning (ML) algorithms were developed to test the premise that with the appropriate variables, even a simple ML model could produce reasonable prediction of stock prices. Therefore, the originality of our approach is a rational selection of relevant and useful features and also on-the-fly model re-training taking advantage of the human time scale of inference (price prediction) and moderate size of the models. Moreover we do not mix any trading strategy with our stock-price prediction experiments, to ensure that conclusions are not context-dependent.Systems that integrate and test sentiment and technical analysis are considered the best candidates for an eventual generalized trading algorithm that can be applied to any stock, future, or traded commodity. However, much work remains to be done in applying natural language processing and the choice of text sources to find the most effective mixture of sentiment and technical analysis. Work on this area will be included in the next phase of our research project and here we have summarized some of the most relevant existing works in this direction. © 2023 IEEE."

Specifically, we investigate how the trading volume and number of trades in Bitcoin and Ethereum react to the release of U.S., German and Japanese macroeconomic news. Using 5-min frequency Bitcoin and Ethereum prices quoted against the US dollar, we find that the volume and number of trades show a significant response to macroeconomic releases. Furthermore, both the volume and number of trades in Bitcoin and Ethereum react to the same U.S. macroeconomic news, such as the Consumer Confidence Index, new home sales, and FOMC rate decisions.

In this paper, we propose the first solution to achieve a timing guarantee on blockchain. To this end, we raise and address two issues for timely transactions on a blockchain: (a) architectural support, and (b) real-time scheduling principles specialized for blockchain. For (a), we modify an existing blockchain network, offering an interface to preferentially select the transactions with the earliest deadlines. We then extend the blockchain network to provide the flexibility of the number of generated blocks at a single block time. Under such architectural supports, we achieve (b) with three steps. First, to resolve a discrepancy between a periodic request of a transaction-generating node and the corresponding arrival on a block-generating node, we translate the former into the latter, which eases the modeling of the transaction load imposed on the blockchain network. Second, we derive a schedulability condition of the modeled transaction load, which guarantees no missed deadline for all transactions under a work-conserving deadline-based scheduling policy. Last, we develop a lazy scheduling policy and its condition, which reduces the number of generated blocks without compromising the degree of timing guarantees for the work-conserving policy. By implementing RT-blockchain on top of an existing open-source blockchain project, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling principles with architectural supports in not only ensuring timely transactions but also reducing the number of generating blocks.  © 2023 IEEE."

Inadequate understanding of the elements that have a significant impact on the price of bitcoin might potentially result in poor investing decisions. Now, there are more than $230 billion worth of openly traded cryptocurrencies on the market. The main purpose of Bitcoin, the most valuable cryptocurrency, which also has the best price predictability, is to act as a digital store of wealth. Bitcoin is a digital currency that is used all over the world for advanced payments or mostly for speculation. For instance, Bitcoin is decentralized because no one owns it. Bitcoin exchanges are easy since they are not tied to any one country. This research study employs a variety of machine learning approaches to predict Bitcoin values. Accurate price prediction is crucial for making wise investing decisions nowadays because of its high volatility feature. The price of bitcoin is initially divided into daily and high-frequency categories in this study. A collection of high-dimensional characteristics and fundamental trading features are used, respectively, for its daily and price forecast. Next, we see that while sophisticated machine learning algorithms like SVM accurately forecast pricing, statistical approaches like linear regression do not. The significance of sample dimensions in machine learning techniques is acknowledged in this study on predicting Bitcoin values.  © 2023 IEEE."

Design/methodology/approach: With high-frequency 5-min overlapping price data, the authors employ the Johansen cointegration test to investigate long-run relationships, the Granger causality test to assess short-run dynamics and the BEKK-GARCH model for volatility spillover investigation. Findings: The empirical findings reveal that the SGX Nifty futures market is cointegrated with the US DJIA market. The US DJIA stock index strongly influences the price discovery of SGX Nifty futures and past innovations in the US markets strongly impact the current volatility of SGX Nifty futures. Practical implications: Findings from this study have significant implications for market participants, particularly foreign investors and portfolio managers. These findings might be helpful for market participants to improve the prediction power of expected SGX Nifty futures price and volatility, especially under the closure of the spot market. Also, SGX market participants can take the significant role of the US market into account when formulating hedging and trading strategies with Indian Nifty futures. Besides, our findings have significant implications for policymakers in evaluating market stability. Originality/value: This article adds to the very limited research on offshore or international stock index futures; it is the first study that empirically examines the international linkages of offshore SGX Nifty futures under the closure of its underlying spot market and also the driving force behind the linkages. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."

In this paper, the authors develop a non-recurrent active trading algorithm based on stock price prediction, using Support Vector Machines on high frequency data, and compare its risk adjusted performance to the returns of a statistical portfolio predicted by the Capital Asset Pricing Model. The authors selected the three highest volume securities from a pool of 100 initially selected stock dataset to investigate the algorithmic trading strategy. The abnormal return estimates are significant and positive, and the systematic risk is lower than unity in all cases, suggesting lower risk compared to the market. Moreover, the estimated beta values for all stocks were close to zero, indicating a market independent process. The correlation analysis revealed weak correlations among the processes, supporting the potential for risk reduction and volatility mitigation through portfolio diversification. The authors tested an equally weighted portfolio of the selected three assets and demonstrated a remarkable return of 1348% during the evaluation period from July 1st, 2020, to January 1st, 2023.

Assuming that the price spreads of trading pairs are mean-reverting, this strategy exploits the disequilibrium in financial markets to find arbitrage investment opportunities. Pairs trading has been widely applied to stock, ETF, and commodity markets. However, the effectiveness of this method for cryptocurrency markets has yet to be properly explored. Therefore, we examine the profitability of pairs trading for 26 cryptocurrencies traded on the Binance exchange at high frequencies of 1, 5, and 60 min. In addition to the traditional statistical methods of distance, correlation, cointegration, and stochastic differential residual (SDR), we focus on two evolutionary algorithms: genetic algorithm (GA) and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). During the 79-trading-day period from 11 January to 31 March 2018, NSGA-II showed the best results at all frequencies, with an average return of 2.84%. Among the statistical models, SDR ranks first, whereas Correlation ranks last, with average returns of 1.63% and −0.48%, respectively. The z-test results show that the models are statistically significantly different. We propose NSGA-II as the best candidate for use in pairs trading strategies in cryptocurrency markets. © 2023 by the authors."

Although some previous studies using actual trading data have suggested that high-frequency trading (HFT) may take this characteristic into account, HFT firms have not disclosed their specific strategies. Furthermore, there has been a long-standing debate in the empirical research field as to whether HFT is the cause of flash crashes, but no final conclusion has been reached. In the present study, we analysed the impacts of HFT taking into account the correlation between order book imbalance and future returns on a stable market and on a market with a flash crash, using agent-based simulations, which are said to be capable of analysing events in their essence. We also analysed how HFT investment performance differs between those two market conditions. The results showed that HFT has the effect of further stabilizing the market when the market is stable but does not take place during flash crashes and so is unable to affect the market either for the good or the bad. The results also suggest that the proposed HFT’s performance is more sensitive to market price fluctuations than conventional HFT (i.e., HFT following a position market-making strategy) and tends to have high risk and high returns.

This paper proposes a high-frequency stock price prediction method based on mode decomposition and deep learning to improve intraday stock price prediction accuracy. Firstly, this method stabilizes the stock price series through empirical mode decomposition to tackle the issue of random noise interference. Then the convolutional neural network is introduced to extract the high-dimensional data features hidden in the stock price series by using multiple convolution kernels. Furthermore, the gated recurrent unit is used to process time-sequential data and to predict the stock prices at the minute level. The experimental result indicates that the proposed high-frequency stock price prediction method can achieve a significant forecasting effect, and its accuracy outperforms the existing methods. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

Our results indicate that OU models can obtain an average return of 50.62% per annum and a Sharpe ratio of 2.63, which significantly exceed those of traditional pairs trading strategies. However, none of them could ‘win’ in every subperiod with diverse market conditions. Meanwhile, we find that introducing jump-diffusion indeed improves the performance (additional 25.37% annualized return and 1.12 Sharpe ratio). In contrast, considering more regimes does not always bring additional benefits.

Traditional statistical analysis methods are far from being able to capture the important information hidden in stock price fluctuations. In recent years, as deep learning algorithms have been widely used in the field of time series forecasting, more and more scholars have tried to use deep learning algorithms to improve the forecasting accuracy of stock returns. Compared with traditional econometric statistical models, deep learning algorithms have shown great advantages, specifically in that deep learning algorithms can extract volatility series features that are more abstract and have stronger predictive power without doing feature engineering. In this paper, we propose a multivariate LSTM composite model based on LSTM and GARCH class model, combining the advantages of deep learning models and traditional statistical analysis models, in order to improve the accuracy of stock volatility prediction in the context of high frequency data. In this paper, we select intra-day minute series data from 2020-2022 and compare and analyze the forecasting results of hybrid LSTM and GARCH class model, single GARCH class model, single variable LSTM model, and multivariate LSTM model. The experimental results show that the hybrid LSTM and GARCH class model is better than the multivariate LSTM model. The multivariate LSTM model is better than the single LSTM model and the single GARCH class model. In addition, the HG-LSTM model has the highest prediction accuracy. © 2023 IEEE."

MLOs are liquidity-taking orders that specify a price limit and are for immediate execution only; however, if the price limit of the MLO precludes it from being filled, the exchange cancels the order. We frame our model as an impulse control problem with stochastic latency where the trader controls the times and the price limits of the MLOs sent to the exchange. We show that impatient liquidity takers submit MLOs that may walk the book (capped by the limit price) to increase the probability of filling the trades. On the other hand, patient liquidity takers use speculative MLOs that are only filled if there has been an advantageous move in prices over the latency period. Patient traders who are fast do not use their speed to hit the quotes they observe, or to finish the execution programme early; they use speed to complete the execution programme with as many speculative MLOs as possible. We use foreign exchange data to implement the random-latency-optimal strategy and to compare it with four benchmarks. For patient traders, the random-latency-optimal strategy outperforms the benchmarks by an amount that is greater than the transaction costs paid by liquidity takers in foreign exchange markets. Around news announcements, the value of the outperformance is between two and ten times the value of the transaction costs. The superiority of the strategy is due to both the speculative MLOs that are filled and the price protection of the MLOs. © 2022, The Author(s)."

It can be done by using various time series forecasting techniques and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The current research focuses on the modeling and forecasting of stock market indices using high-frequency data. A recent high-frequency volatility model is called the Realized GARCH (RGARCH) model, where the key feature is an equation that relates the realized measure to the conditional variance of returns. This equation incorporates an asymmetric reaction to shocks, providing a highly flexible representation of market dynamics. This paper proposes an hybrid model where ANN and RGARCH are used to forecast stock return volatility. This model was established by entering the predicted Realized Volatility (RV), calculated using RGARCH, into the ANN. The choice of the input variables of the ANN is made using the Granger causality test in order to reduce the noise which would affect the prediction system and which could be generated by an input variable not statistically linked to stock market volatility. The results show that a hybrid model based on a recurrent neural network (RNN) outperforms the RGARCH and HAR-type models in out-of-sample evaluations according to the RMSE and the correlation coefficient. © 2023 South Ural State University.

Previous studies mainly focused on data mining in the prediction direction to quantify carbon trading prices. Although the prospect of high-frequency data forecasting mechanisms is considerable, more mixed-frequency ensemble forecasting is needed for carbon trading prices. Therefore, this article designs a new type of ensemble prediction model to increase the scope of model research. The module is divided into three parts: data denoising, mixed frequency and machine learning, multi-objective optimization, and ensemble forecasting. Precisely, the data preprocessing technology enhanced by adopting a self-attention mechanism can better remove noise and extract effective features. Furthermore, mixed frequency technology is introduced into the machine learning model to achieve more comprehensive and efficient prediction, and a new evaluation criterion is proposed to measure the optimal submodel. Finally, the ensemble model based on deep learning strategy can effectively integrate the advantages of high-frequency and low-frequency data in complex datasets. At the same time, a new multi-objective optimization algorithm is proposed to optimize the parameters of the ensemble model, significantly improving the predictive ability of the integrated module. The results of four experiments and the Mean Absolute Percent Error index of the proposed model improved by 28.3526% compared to machine learning models, indicating that the ensemble model established can effectively address the time distribution characteristics and uncertainty issues predicted by carbon trading price models, which helps to mitigate climate change and develop a low-carbon economy.

Commonly used pairs and multiple trading strategies are constructed using the Kalman Filter (KF) and exploiting mean reversion in co-integrated nonstationary stock prices. However, KFs are sensitive to model errors. Misspecified modelling produces unstable solutions for dynamic systems. Fading-Memory Filter (FMF) uses a discounting weight to past observations. Compared to a standard KF, FMF addresses more recent observations and is more resilient (less sensitive) to modelling errors. However, the FMF algorithm does not provide slope parameter covariance matrix updates and innovation volatility forecasts. This paper proposes a novel resilient FMF algorithm for pairs trading and multiple trading by defining an appropriate data-driven innovation volatility forecasting model. The FMF-based strategies are implemented through some experiments on the hourly prices (high-frequency data) of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. It is shown that the proposed FMF trading strategies outperform the existing KF trading strategies and they are more profitable in the bear market over time, especially for continuous falling of prices and the short-lived and sharp rally recovery where prices are not stationary. © 2023 IEEE."

BBCA shares during the period 2017 to 2019 always occupy position 2 in the ranking of stocks with the highest frequency of transactions in the banking sector. One of the problems faced by an investor in stock trading activities is volatility, where there will always be price fluctuations. This makes analysis activities very important as a determinant of success in stock trading. One form of analysis that can be done by stock investors is Technical Analysis, but the indicators used in technical analysis still cannot produce results that can describe price movements perfectly. The Time Series analysis method can be used to provide additional information to Technical Analysis because stock data is included in the time series data group. This study aims to find out the results of the implementation of three types of Time Series analysis methods, namely Linear Trend Regression, Exponential Smoothing, and ARIMA on Bank Central Asia stock price index data for the 2020-2022 period and determine the method with the best accuracy level among the three methods. The results of this study indicate that the ARIMA (1,1,0) method produces the smallest RMSE value at 162.9544 so that it has the best accuracy level among the three methods used.

However, previous studies of crude oil futures price forecasting either consider only a single variable without adequately accounting for the influence of various factors on crude oil prices, or they consider only the same frequency of influences and ignore the importance of mixed frequencies, resulting in forecasts that do not achieve the desired results. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes a new multivariate combinatorial mixed frequency forecasting system to predict the weekly closing price of crude oil futures. The system is divided into four modules: Data denoising, Feature selection, Combined forecasting, and Performance evaluation module. To obtain smooth data, ICEEMDAN is used to denoise the original data. Furthermore, to select appropriate variables and reduce model redundancy, recursive feature elimination is used to select appropriate variables with low frequency. Considering the importance of mixed-frequency data, the mutual information method was used to select appropriate high-frequency variables for modeling the crude oil price forecast model. To overcome the shortcomings of Back Propagation Neural Network, Gate Recurrent Unit, and Radial Basis Function Neural Network models, integrate their advantages, and obtain accurate and stable prediction results, a combined forecasting mechanism based on a Multi-Objective Sparrow Search algorithm was developed to obtain both point and interval forecasting results, and finally, two data sets were selected for empirical analysis. The results show that the mean absolute percentage errors of the point forecast of this model are 1.96% and 1.84%, respectively, about 31% and 15% higher than those of the competing models (mean absolute percentage errors 2.57% and 2.13%, respectively). For interval forecasting, the accumulated width deviation is 0.0037 and 0.002, respectively, about 35% and 25% higher than those of the competing models (accumulated width deviation 0.005 and 0.0025, respectively). Thus, the proposed forecasting framework outperforms all comparative models and can be used effectively for forecasting crude oil prices.  © 2013 IEEE."

The analysis shows that the proposed dynamic cross-network tariff can release stronger price signals to stimulate the tide distribution of P2P trading on the less utilized lines, while discouraging the higher utilized lines from generating more net tide increments to achieve the effect of ""low promotion and high suppression""and realize the effective utilization of network assets.  © 2023 IEEE."

Therefore, it is very necessary to choose a suitable export method rationally. Based on the existing theories, this paper conducts an empirical analysis of Enterprise A, and analyzed export methods such as special regional exports, general exports, cross-border EC B2B direct exports, and cross-border EC exports to overseas warehouses; when establishing a export service supply evaluation index system, priority is given to export service supply; therefore, in the selection of export methods, the matrix method is first used to analyze it and combine it with service accessibility and AHP. The experimental results show that the highest overseas warehousing score is 78.705, which is the most suitable export model for the current development of Enterprise A.

In order to establish a verification method for wind power generation metering data, a step-by-5tep k-means clustering algorithm based on discrete wavelet transform is proposed to explore the variation laws of wind power fluctuation, so that a basis for missing data fitting and abnormal data correction of wind power generation curves can be built. The frequency domain analysis of wind power generation data is carried out by using discrete wavelet transform, and the generation curve is decomposed into different frequency ranges. For the frequency domain results after multiple wavelets transforms, step-by-tep k-means clustering is carried out from the lowest frequency component to the highest frequency component. This processing method can etfetively ensure that the information of stroke fluctuation is not lost in the clustering process. Typical curves extracted based on clustering are used to fit the missing data.

We theorize digital transformation as a progressive replacement of humans by digital technologies in performing an organization’s fundamental activities underpinning the processes of scanning, interpretation, and learning that encompass an organization’s interaction with its environment. As a result, organizations cease to be human interpretation systems and instead turn into digital enactment systems, where digital technologies, instead of humans, nearly autonomously create and act upon information.

In the present study, we show the predictive ability of conditional EVT models in the cryptocurrency market during the price upsurge of 2020–2021. Taking high-frequency intraday data of four popular cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Binance coin, we compare the accuracy of different competing models in estimating intraday value at risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES). The present study focuses on the extreme value theory (EVT) for modeling the tail of the distribution to forecast the measures of intraday VaR and ES. The study confirms the fat-tailed behavior of intraday returns of all four cryptocurrencies. Further, the study shows the magnitudes of high negative shocks are more than the positive ones for the returns of all four cryptocurrencies. The study uses suitable GARCH-family models such as apARCH, EGARCH, and CGARCH in the ARMA-GARCH framework. Using a two-stage approach the study shows how GARCH-EVT models with skewed student’s—t distribution outperform the predictability of conditional EVT with standard normal distribution as well as the unconditional EVT models in predicting intraday VaR and ES.

Due to the inability of air cooling to cool down recent high-configured servers with higher Thermal Design Power, current thermal requirements in machine learning, AI, blockchain, 5G, edge computing, and high-frequency trading have resulted in a larger deployment of immersion cooling. Dielectric fluids are far more efficient at transferring heat than air. Immersion cooling promises to help address many of the challenges that come with air cooling systems, especially as computing densities increase. Immersion-cooled data centers are more expandable, quicker installation, more energy-efficient, allows for the cooling of almost all server components, save more money for enterprises, and are more robust overall. By eliminating active cooling components such as fans, immersion cooling enables a significantly higher density of computing capabilities. When utilizing immersion cooling for server hardware that is intended to be air-cooled, immersion-specific optimized heat sinks should be used. A heat sink is an important component for server cooling efficacy. This research conducts an optimization of heatsink for immersion-cooled servers to achieve the minimum case temperature possible utilizing multi-objective and multi-design variable optimization with pumping power as the constraint. A high-density server of 3.76 kW was modeled on Ansys Icepak that consists of 2 CPUs and 8 GPUs with heatsink assemblies at their Thermal Design Power along with 32 Dual In-line Memory Modules. The optimization is conducted for Aluminum heat sinks by minimizing the pressure drop and thermal resistance as the objective functions whereas fin count, fin thickness, and heat sink height are chosen as the design variables in all CPUs, and GPUs heatsink assemblies. Optimization for the CPU and the GPU heatsink was done separately and then the optimized heatsinks were tested in an actual test setup of the server in ANSYS Icepak. The dielectric fluid for this numerical study is EC-110 and the cooling is carried out using forced convection. A Design of Experiment (DOE) is created based on the input range of design variables using a full-factorial approach to generate multiple design points. The effect of the design variables is analyzed on the objective functions to establish the parameters that have a greater impact on the performance of the optimized heatsink. The optimization study is done using Ansys OptiSLang where AMOP (Adaptive Metamodel of Optimal Prognosis) as the sampling method for design exploration.

Market makers need to continuously optimize their ask and bid prices to provide liquidity and make profits, which can be viewed as a continuous control problem. Reinforcement learning is a common method for solving sequential decision-making problems, in which an agent learns from reward signals through interactions with the environment to maximize the cumulative return. However, traditional online reinforcement learning methods can be inefficient in practice as they require the agent to interact with the environment to collect training data, which could be unstable. Additionally, exploration in financial trading can be very expensive. To address these issues, we apply offline reinforcement learning methods which use historical experience to train agents. In this paper, we present ORL4MM (Offline Reinforcement Learning for Market Making), a novel market making agent using offline training and online fine-tuning to mitigate potential losses and instabilities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments, where our agent outperforms all baseline models, including traditional models and online RL agents.

Furthermore, problems faced by intraday traders worldwide, due to usage of algorithmic trading software include complex and incomprehensible user interfaces, trading of illiquid securities, handling of special days, exorbitant trading and brokerage fees, and multiple risks including regulatory, financial, reputational, operational and technological risks. We propose a clean, lightweight and object oriented approach toward algorithmic trading, eliminating the need for commercial algorithmic trading software.

We propose a marked renewal Hawkes process to model the occurrence times of losses that exceed a threshold (exceedances) and a generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) enhanced with a time dependent scale parameter to model the size of the losses above the threshold (loss excesses). The scale parameter of the GPD evolves dynamically based on past exceedance occurrence times and loss excesses. A quantile autoregression model is used to define the exceedances as losses that exceed a time dependent threshold to accommodates for the cyclic trends of intraday trading. The arrival process of exogenous exceedances forms a renewal process and we investigate different waiting time distributions by applying the models to ASX stock data. We find evidence that the log-normal waiting time distribution provides the best quality in-sample fit among the competing models.

The practice of agricultural price time series mining proves that the financial time series mining model can use the mined knowledge to conduct qualitative analysis on the trend of financial time series, which can effectively guide users' market behavior and assist users in making decisions. The time variability of data content requires that mining algorithms have the ability to deal with concept drift and reflect the evolution of data. Because of the complexity of time series flow, the research of time series flow mining is still in the exploratory stage.  © 2023 IEEE."

The purpose of this paper is to answer the following questions: (1) To what extent has DL penetrated the research being done in finance? (2) What areas of financial research have applications of DL, and what quality of work has been done in the niches? (3) What areas still need to be explored and have scope for future research? Design/methodology/approach: This paper employs bibliometric analysis, a potent yet simple methodology with numerous applications in literature reviews. This paper focuses on citation analysis, author impacts, relevant and vital journals, co-citation analysis, bibliometric coupling and co-occurrence analysis. The authors collected 693 articles published in 2000–2022 from journals indexed in the Scopus database. Multiple software (VOSviewer, RStudio (biblioshiny) and Excel) were employed to analyze the data. Findings: The findings reveal significant and renowned authors' impact in the field. The analysis indicated that the application of DL in finance has been on an upward track since 2017. The authors find four broad research areas (neural networks and stock market simulations; portfolio optimization and risk management; time series analysis and forecasting; high-frequency trading) with different degrees of intertwining and emerging research topics with the application of DL in finance. This article contributes to the literature by providing a systematic overview of the DL developments, trajectories, objectives and potential future research topics in finance. Research limitations/implications: The findings of this paper act as a guide for literature review for anyone interested in doing research in the intersection of finance and DL. The article also explores multiple areas of research that have yet to be studied to a great extent and have abundant scope. Originality/value: Very few studies have explored the applications of machine learning (ML), namely, DL in finance, which is a much more specialized subset of ML. The authors look at the problem from the aspect of different techniques in DL that have been used in finance. This is the first qualitative (content analysis) and quantitative (bibliometric analysis) assessment of current research on DL in finance. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."

The market structure, which has become far more complex over the past three decades, has mostly evolved endogenously as the global FX market is subject to notably less regulatory oversight than equity and bond markets in most countries. Major banks used to dominate liquidity provision, but they have found their role challenged by High Frequency Trading firms in an increasingly fragmented electronic market. The information structure of the market has also changed. As such, high-frequency cross-asset correlations, especially with the futures market, have become more important. The chapter also discusses the important role of the official sector in the FX market, and it highlights a few special topics such as flash events and the FX fixing scandal.

Specifically, the proposed approach uses rough path theory to extract signature path features from the LOB data and compresses them for training machine learning models. We compare the performance of this approach to standard autoregression methods and demonstrate its superior performance in terms of model prediction error. In addition, we use deep neural networks (DNN) and random forest (RF) to further test the proposed approach's performance compared to standard approaches using raw LOB data. The findings show that Sig-DNN, DNN with signature features, outperforms DNN with raw LOB data in terms of prediction error and efficiency, while Sig-RF, RF with signature features, underperformed RF with raw LOB data in terms of prediction but not in efficiency. We evaluate the proposed approach on multiple exchanges, including the Johannesburg and New York Stock Exchanges, and the results demonstrate better prediction error and efficiency performance in developed markets compared to emerging markets.

However, it is challenging to integrate the computationally intensive AI algorithm into the existing trading pipeline due to its excessively long latency and insufficient throughput, necessitating a breakthrough in hardware. Furthermore, harsh HFT environments such as bursty data traffic and stringent power constraint make it even more difficult to achieve system-level performance without missing crucial market signals.In this paper, we present LightTrader, the world's first AI-enabled HFT system that incorporates an FPGA and custom AI accelerators for short-latency-high-throughput trading systems. Leveraging the computing power of brand-new AI accelerators fabricated in TSMC's 7nm FinFET technology, LightTrader optimizes the tick-to-trade latency and response rate for stock market data. The AI accelerators, adopting Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Array (CGRA) architecture, which maximizes the hardware utilization from the flexible dataflow architecture, achieve a throughput of 16 TFLOPS and 64 TOPS. In addition, we propose both workload scheduling and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) scheduling algorithms to find an optimal offloading strategy under bursty market data traffic and limited power condition. Finally, we build a reliable and rerunnable simulation framework that can back-test the historical market data, such as Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), to evaluate the LightTrader system. We thoroughly explore the performance of LightTrader when the number of AI accelerators, power conditions, and complexity of deep neural network models change. As a result, LightTrader achieves 13.92× and 7.28× speed-up of AI algorithm processing compared to existing GPU-based, FPGA-based systems, respectively. LightTrader with multiple AI accelerators achieves up to 99.5% response rates, while LightTrader with the proposed workload scheduling and DVFS scheduling algorithm relieves the miss rate from 17.1% to 23.1%. © 2023 IEEE."

Findings noted that the algorithms performances varied depending on the market circumstances with certain strategies only being applicable to either strong or weak market conditions. The implication of these findings opens the door to new discussions since the algorithms developed resided outside of the traditional high frequency trading model which are the most prominent trading applications found on the markets.

As a classical problem of quantitative trading, Stock Trend Prediction (STP) mainly predicts the movement of stock price in the future through the historical price information to better guide quantitative trading. In recent years, some deep learning work has made great progress in STP by effectively grasping long-term timing information. However, as a kind of real-time series data, short-term timing information is also very important, because stock trading is high-frequency and price fluctuates violently. And with the popularity of Transformer, there is a lack of an effective combination of feature extraction and Transformer in STP tasks. To make better use of short term information, we propose One-dimensional Convolution Embedding (OCE). Simultaneously, we introduce effective feature extraction with Transformer into STP problem to extract feature information and capture long-term timing information. By combining OCE and Transformer organically, we propose a noval STP prediction model, One-dimensional Convolution Embedding Transformer (OCET), to capture long-term and short-term time series information. Finally, OCET achieves a highest accuracy up to 0.927 in public benchmark FI-2010 When reasoning speed is twice that of SOTA models and a highest accuracy of 0.426 in HKGSAS-2020. Empirical results on these two datasets show that our OCET is significantly superior than other algorithms in STP tasks.

We develop a quantile recurrent forecasting algorithm via the recurrent algorithm of singular spectrum analysis that can be implemented for any type of time series data. When applied to median forecasting of deterministic and shortand long-memory processes, our quantile recurrent forecast overlaps the true signal. By estimating only the signal dimension number of parameters, this method can construct a recurrent formula by including many lag periods. We apply this method to obtain median forecasts for Facebook, Microsoft, and SNAP’s intraday and daily closing prices. Both for intraday and daily closing prices, the quantile recurrent forecasts produce lower mean absolute deviation from original prices compared to bootstrap median forecasts.

The efficient market hypothesis (EMH) states that stock prices follow a random walk and are unpredictably fluctuating. Furthermore, the price contains all accessible data, and we can’t extrapolate profitability from previous or current data, thus technical analysis (TA) is ineffective for projecting future prices. Technical indicators (TI) are calculated using past prices, and they are divided into two categories: trend TI and oscillators. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of predictions for three stocks traded on the Casablanca Stock Exchange (CSE): IAM, Attijari Wafa Bank (ATW), and Banque Centrale Populaire (BCP). We combined trend TI with Long Short Term Memory model (LTSM) to make predictions and compared the results to the Random Forest model (RF).

The main objective is to establish a relationship between the dependent factor, stock price, and independent factors such as opening price, closing price, high and low values of stock, and volume of stocks bought. The need for this research emerged from the significant impact of stock market decisions on financial gain for investors. With a high percentage of retail traders in the Indian trade market experiencing losses in recent times, there is a demand for effective prediction techniques to assist investors in making informed decisions. This study differentiates itself from existing literature by focusing specifically on the Indian trade and incorporating deep learning algorithms. In this approch, the solution utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in conjunction with a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network-based model to analyze various quantitative strategies in stock markets. The CNN is employed for stock selection, automatically extracting features from quantitative data, followed by an LSTM to preserve time-series features, enhancing profit margins. This combined CNN-LSTM model is used for stock price prediction. we will be using stock technical indicator (STI's) and derive a final prediction with the help weighted average ensemble model. The expected outcome of this research is to provide retail traders with a valuable tool for making informed decisions in the Indian stock market. The performance measures of the developed models, such as accuracy values, will be used to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of different deep learning architectures. Theeventual outcome of this paper will contribute to the field of stock market prediction and assist investors in achieving financial gain by adopting AI-based prediction techniques.  © 2023 IEEE."

This model is generalized to the form where the riskiness of profit, measured by its per-time-unit volatility, is controlled (e.g. in case of existence of limits on riskiness of trading strategies imposed by regulatory bodies). The resulting optimization problem need not be convex. In spite of this undesirable fact, it is demonstrated that the problem is still efficiently solvable. In addition, the problem that parameters of the price difference process are never known exactly and are imprecisely estimated from an observed finite sample is investigated (recalling that this problem is critical for practice). It is shown how the imprecision affects the optimal trading strategy by quantification of the loss caused by the imprecise estimate compared to a theoretical trader knowing the parameters exactly.

The prediction model is used to predict price trends, and the trading strategy is used to determine the price and volume of the order. Most trading strategies consist of multiple trading logic associated with certain tuning parameters. These parameters significantly affect the profitability of high-frequency trading frameworks. There are two main disadvantages of this framework: 1) the price trend prediction model can not adapt to the current market data distribution, and 2) the trading strategy can not adapt to the current market conditions automatically. Thus, the framework cannot always maintain positive revenue. To address this problem, we propose a novel dynamic parameter optimization algorithm based on reinforcement learning for stock prediction and trading, and to generate an adaptive trading framework. First, we use a rolling model training method for stock price trend prediction. Second, we regard each set of strategy parameters as action and devise an inverse reinforcement learning algorithm for the reward function to accurately estimate the reward of each action. Because of the T+1 trading rules of the Chinese stock market, we consider the constraint of limited short position in the reward function. Finally, a reward-enhanced upper confidence bound (UCB) selection algorithm is proposed to automatically optimize the parameters of the trading logic in real-time trading. The experimental results show that our method achieves competitive performance in the Chinese stock market.  © 2013 IEEE."

To identify this effect, we first measure the intraday impact of FX intervention using a novel confidential, high-frequency, minute-by-minute data set of interventions between 2009 and 2017. Next, we use our measure to estimate the persistence of FX intervention shocks over longer horizons (in trading days), using local projections.

This study applies CTS to bus industry and addresses the interaction problem between purchase decision of bus operators and policy-implementation decision of the government, and improves evolutionary game theory by considering the incentive effects of strategies within the same group to discuss stable strategies of each parties. Simulation experiments are conducted to validate the correctness of the improved model and investigate the effects of key parameters on the evolution of decision behaviors. The results show that subsidy effect of different carbon prices varies significantly under different cost gaps of new energy buses (NEBs) and fuel buses (FBs), and there is an optimal carbon price range, i.e. 0.163–0.263 CNY/kg in this research. The initial carbon quota less than and close to the carbon emissions of FB can achieve the optimal subsidy effect. Maintaining high-frequency inspections on operators can ensure smooth proliferation of NEBs.

Enhanced Weathering as one of the negative emission technologies is being tested in the field now, but lacks a verifiable and cost-effective carbon accounting approach. Based on results from a lab scale column experiment and field observations, it is hypothesized that the observed stable positive correlation between total alkalinity and electrical conductivity may present a way to easily predict the initial CO2 sequestration at the application site by chemical mineral weathering at low costs. Alkalinity is a measure to track weathering products. It is not difficult to measure, yet continuous and mid- to high-frequency sampling and analyses are expensive and time consuming. The observed strong correlation of alkalinity with electrical conductivity could be harnessed and enable a CO2 uptake monitoring by simple electrical conductivity measurements in soils or any point in the discharge system. For a successful implementation and calibration, data are needed, covering the most likely employment scenarios of soil, climate, hydrology, rock product, application scenario and plant abundance.

First, we provide evidence for the predictive value of US Nonfarm Payroll (USNP) in the out-of-sample forecast of gold market volatility. Second, we extend our analysis to other precious metals and the US stock market index for robustness purposes. Third, we utilize mixed data frequencies based on the availability of data, thus, circumventing any bias or information loss due to the use of monthly (low frequency) USNP data and daily (high frequency) gold price data. The results show that the USNP, which reflects gain/loss in US non-farm jobs, is negatively related to gold return volatility, implying that deterioration (improvement) in the economy due to job losses (gains) raises (lowers) the gold market volatility as its trading improves (deteriorates) while the reverse is the case for US stocks. The out-of-sample predictive value of USNP in the return volatility of gold is also established as the model which includes the former offers better out-of-sample forecast gains than the benchmark model which ignores it. Additional analyses involving other precious metals, namely palladium, platinum, rhodium, and silver, show the same direction of relationship as gold, albeit with higher forecast gains for silver than the others.

In this paper, we propose a combination approach that integrates the XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting), SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique), and NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II) methods. We applied the proposed approach on the direction prediction and simulation trading of rebar futures, which are traded on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Firstly, the minority classes of the high-frequency rebar futures price change magnitudes are oversampled using the SMOTE algorithm to overcome the imbalance problem of the class data. Then, XGBoost is adopted to construct a multiclassification model for the price-movement-direction prediction. Next, the proposed approach employs NSGA-II to optimize the parameters of the pre-designed trading rule for trading simulation. Finally, the price-movement direction is predicted, and we conducted the high-frequency trading based on the optimized XGBoost model and the trading rule, with the classification and trading performances empirically evaluated by four metrics over four testing periods. Meanwhile, the LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) is applied as a model explanation approach to quantify the prediction contributions of features to the forecasting samples. From the experimental results, we found that the proposed approach performed best in terms of direction prediction accuracy, profitability, and return–risk ratio. The proposed approach could be beneficial for decision-making of the rebar traders and related companies engaged in rebar futures trading. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

This paper constructs a new deep ensemble learning framework combining signal decomposition and exogenous variable feature mining for high-frequency futures price prediction, which consists of depth feature extraction (DFE), long short-term memory optimized by attention mechanism (ALSTM) and Light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM). In the depth feature extraction stage, based on multi-scale entropy (MSE) and Savitzky-Golay filter (SG filter), an improved denoising variational mode decomposition (VMD) is proposed to extract the fluctuation characteristics of futures price signal and eliminate the interference of complex components. To avoid the collinearity redundancy of high-dimensional exogenous variables, an enhanced dimensionality reduction method combining Spearman correlation analysis and stacked autoencoder (SAE) is designed to ensure the simplicity and correlation of input factors. In the prediction phase, ALSTM is adopted as a base predictor for constructing point prediction model by the DFE results, which can focus on learning more important data features. Finally, LightGBM, which has excellent effect in the field of ensemble learning, is used to integrate the base prediction results to obtain the final results. The actual closing price data of three representative futures varieties in China's futures market are selected to verify the accuracy of the proposed framework. Compared with other benchmark models, this developed framework has better futures closing price prediction performance. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."

The motivation for the study is derived from the expectation that pandemics and epidemics which are infectious would limit activities and events that require physical interactions such as those associated with T&L, and therefore, returns on related investments may decline during this period. Design/methodology/approach: The authors formulate a model in line with Westerlund and Narayan (2012, 2015) where uncertainty due to infectious diseases is included as a predictor in the valuation of T&L stocks while also controlling for endogeneity bias (for omitted variables bias), conditional heteroscedasticity effect (typical of high frequency data) and persistence (typical of most financial and economic time series). Findings: The authors’ results suggest that contrary to the negative impact of previous cases of pandemics and epidemics on the T&L stocks, the behavior of these stocks during COVID-19 pandemic is modest owing to the positive nexus between equity market volatility due to infectious diseases (EMV-ID) (our proxy for pandemics and epidemics) and the T&L returns during the COVID-19 period. The authors maintain that investors in this market need not panic as the market tends to be resilient to pandemics over time albeit with a lower resilience during daily trading. The results leading to this conclusion are robust to alternative measures of the COVID-19 pandemic. Originality/value: The peculiarity of this paper on T&L stocks is premised on the introduction of the new datasets for infectious diseases, and the need to include the COVID-19 pandemic given its peculiarity. Essentially, we utilize the Baker et al. (2020) dataset which captures all the pandemics including COVID-19 and a complementary dataset on the COVID-19 pandemic using an alternative approach. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."

In the first stage, a quantitative analysis of our methodology accounts well for the differences in intraday and interday dynamics between the pre-Crisis and post-Crisis periods; in the second stage, with the interday features as input to machine learning methods, we predict directional movements of the daily closing price in the Shanghai stock exchange index and develop trading strategies. Empirical results evince the predictability of the market and the informativity of the interday features when they are included in the machine learning methods.

By employing a genetic algorithm with a classifier system as an adaptive learning tool, we address some of these concerns by studying a dynamic limit order market model with asymmetric information and varying speeds of high-frequency trading (HFT). We show that HFT benefits uninformed traders, improves information efficiency but reduces market liquidity. We find that there is a trade-off where a competition effect erodes the information and speed advantages of high-frequency traders, increasing trading speeds of HF traders reduces market liquidity but generates a hump-shaped relationship to the profitability of high-frequency traders and information efficiency. This research finds there may be potential benefits to throttling the trading speed arms race to improve market efficiency.

We apply the multifractal detrended cross-correlation analysis, which is considered the most reliable method for identifying nonlinear correlations in time series.

Then, a comparison of the performances achieved by the different TSC techniques is carried out. Results obtained show a pronounced difference in terms of performance obtained by all the TSC models when applied to the original dataset against the randomized one. The results achieved by the models applied to the original dataset are significantly better in terms of Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) and Recall. Therefore, the EMH is refused in its weak form, and indisputable evidence against the RWM in a high-frequency scope is provided. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

To model such a sequential decision making process in the dynamic financial markets, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based methods have been applied and demonstrated their success in finding trading strategies that achieve profitable returns. However, the financial markets are complex imperfect information games with high-level of noise and uncertainties which usually make the exploration policy of DRL less effective. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end DRL method that explores solutions on the whole graph via a probabilistic dynamic programming algorithm. Specifically, we separate the state into environment state and position state, and model the position state transition as a directed acyclic graph. To obtain reliable gradients for model training, we adopt a probabilistic dynamic programming algorithm to explore solutions over the whole graph instead of sampling a path. By avoiding the sampling procedure, we propose an efficient training algorithm and overcome the efficiency problem in most existing DRL methods. Furthermore, our method is compatible with most recurrent neural network architecture, which makes our method easy to implement and very effective in practice. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two real-world stock datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can generate stable trading strategies for both high-frequency and low-frequency trading, significantly outperforming the baseline DRL methods on annualized return and Sharpe ratio. © 2022 ACM."

This paper presents an approach to market making using deep reinforcement learning, with the novelty that, rather than to set the bid and ask prices directly, the neural network output is used to tweak the risk aversion parameter and the output of the Avellaneda-Stoikov procedure to obtain bid and ask prices that minimise inventory risk. Two further contributions are, first, that the initial parameters for the Avellaneda-Stoikov equations are optimised with a genetic algorithm, which parameters are also used to create a baseline Avellaneda-Stoikov agent (Gen-AS); and second, that state-defining features forming the RL agent's neural network input are selected based on their relative importance by means of a random forest. Two variants of the deep RL model (Alpha-AS-1 and Alpha-AS-2) were backtested on real data (L2 tick data from 30 days of bitcoin-dollar pair trading) alongside the Gen-AS model and two other baselines. The performance of the five models was recorded through four indicators (the Sharpe, Sortino and P&L-to-MAP ratios, and the maximum drawdown). Gen-AS outperformed the two other baseline models on all indicators, and in turn the two Alpha-AS models substantially outperformed Gen-AS on Sharpe, Sortino and P&L-to-MAP. Localised excessive risk-taking by the Alpha-AS models, as reflected in a few heavy dropdowns, is a source of concern for which possible solutions are discussed. © 2022 Falces Marin et al.

Specifically, various trading strategies that proposed by human-experts are associated with weight hyper-parameters to determine the probability of selecting a specific strategy according to market conditions. Prior work manually adjusting the weight hyper-parameters is error-prone, because the essential advantage of quantitative trading, i.e., automation, is lost. In this paper, we propose a dynamic parameter tuning algorithm, i.e., TradeBot, based on bandit learning for quantitative trading. We consider sequentially selecting hyper-parameters of rules for trading as a bandit game, where a set of hyper-parameters of trading rule is considered as an action. A novel reward-agnostic Upper Confidence Bound bandit method is proposed to solve the automatically trading problem with a reward function estimated by inverse reinforcement learning.

The combination of prediction model and trading policy is the most commonly used framework in practical quantitative trading. Integrated with machine learning methods, this framework brings huge profits to quantified companies. In the framework, the prediction model is used to predict future trading price trend, and the trading policy is used to determine the price and number of orders. Even though, the shortcomings of machine learning models are obvious, mainly are, (1) Slow prediction speed. Huge human-craft features and model computing cost much time, which is ten times of pure trading policy without model. (2) Poor generalization. This kind of models can hardly adapt to market data in each period, because market traders will change time to time at micro level, thus the distribution of market data will change. But current model is trained on a long period dataset, it achieves best effect at average, but can not adapt to different market at each period. To address this problem, we propose a novel online model optimization algorithm. A light model library will be constructed. Each light model in this library corresponds to a different market distribution. By devising the appropriate reward function via inverse reinforcement learning algorithm, the algorithm can accurately estimate the profits of each model. Then the model can be selected automatically in real-time trading, so that the trading policies can automatically adapt to changes in trading market, overcoming previous shortcoming of manually updating model and slow prediction speed.

The consensus algorithm can achieve distributed consensus among nodes in the network. At present, the practical byzantine fault tolerance algorithm (PBFT) consensus algorithm commonly used in alliance blockchain requires all nodes in the network to participate in the consensus process. Experiments show that when the number of consensus nodes in the system exceeds 100, the bandwidth consumption and consensus delay will greatly increase, resulting in the inability of PBFT to be applied. In scenes with many nodes. How to improve the performance of alliance blockchains safely and efficiently has become an urgent problem to be solved at present. For the PBFT commonly used in alliance blockchains, there are some problems, such as large communication overhead, simple selection of master nodes, and inability to expand and exit nodes dynamically in the network. This paper proposes an improved algorithm tPBFT (trust-based practical Byzantine algorithm), which is suitable for high-frequency trading scenarios of consortium chains. By introducing a trust equity scoring mechanism between nodes in the network, the list of consensus nodes can be dynamically adjusted. tPBFT simplifies the pre-prepare stage of the PBFT consensus process, and realizes the verification of the hash transaction list in the reply stage, thereby reducing the interaction overhead between network nodes. Theoretical analysis and experiments show that when the number of nodes in the network is greater than 30, with the further increase of the number of nodes, the improved tPBFT algorithm has a relatively large performance in terms of node communication overhead, consensus efficiency and scalability outperforms the PBFT algorithm. © 2022, The Author(s)."

In these models, the agent maximizes their own utility or value function by solving the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation and designing a strategy for asset trading. The optimal solutions are expressed in terms of parameters describing the arrival rates and the midprice process from the price process, modeled as a GCHP, allowing such characteristics to influence the optimization process, aiming towards the attainment of a more general solution.

The latter condition guarantees that the delivered information per time is limited. The asymptotic behavior of the filter as the arrival frequency tends to infinity is described by limit theorems.

In semi-structured qualitative interviews with leading providers in the energy industry, conducted from 2019 to 2021, hurdles in energy applications are compared with a control group of additional interviews with representatives of companies operating in IT and FinTech. The analysis uses a framework covering technical feasibility, desirability, and economic viability, as well as the role of regulatory frameworks. The interviews reveal that the first Blockchain applications suffered from a combination of technological constraints and inter-platform competition. Due to the permissionless configuration of the early energy Blockchains, they were slow in terms of transaction speed compared to existing platforms and prices per transaction were high, in addition to high degrees of complexity related to requirements from both critical-infrastructure systems and financial market regulation. The analysis further points to the slow adoption of Blockchain applications in the energy sector being related to business models rather focusing on products and platforms as well as on transactional rather than procedural use cases, with a high degree of standardization of the offering and low levels of inclusiveness concerning processes. The move from transaction platforms to innovation platforms and the emergence of Blockchain as a service provider—plus technical advances with regards to high-frequency transactions combined with the increasing importance of use cases, such as proof of origin for fuels or e-charging—may induce a shift from pilot applications to commercialization within the larger innovation ecosystem. While the involvement of Blockchain solutions in energy markets increases with pilot projects and with this, the acceptance of players and stakeholders in the energy ecosystem, a big hurdle for innovation remains the regulation of energy markets to allow for peer-to-peer trading, a usage-driven distribution of network costs, and bottom-up pricing markets. © 2022 by the authors."

Based on the 5-min high-frequency trading data of China’s crude oil futures market in recent 3 years, this paper uses the EMD-MFDFA model combined with multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA) and empirical mode decomposition unsupervised K-means clustering and Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to identify the risk status of each trading day. Further, Support vector machine (SVM), extreme gradient lifting (XGBoost) and their improved algorithms are used to predict the risk state of China’s crude oil futures market. The empirical results are as follows: first, There are obvious multifractal features in the return rate series of China’s crude oil futures market and its single trading day; Second, compared with the traditional SVM model, the improved Twin Support Vector Machine (TWSVM) based on solving the sample imbalance issue has better prediction ability for China’s crude oil futures risk.; Third, The XGBoost has a great impact on the prediction of China’s crude oil risk, and the Focal-XGBoost with focal loss function performs the best in predicting the risk of China’s crude oil futures market.

In order to improve the accuracy of carbon price prediction, a carbon price combination prediction model with variational mode decomposition based on seagull optimization algorithm (SVMD), fluctuation-based dispersion entropy (FDE), extreme learning machine (ELM) and kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) optimized by JAYA algorithm (JAYA-KELM), named SVMD-FDE-ELM-JAYA-KELM, is proposed. To solve the selection of mode number K and the penalty factor α of VMD, SVMD is proposed, which realizes adaptive determination of the parameter K and α. The idea of the SVMD-FDE-ELM-JAYA-KELM is roughly as follows. Firstly, SVMD decomposes carbon price into a series of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). According to the FDE value, these IMFs are divided into high frequency IMFs or low frequency IMFs. Secondly, JAYA-KELM is established for high frequency IMFs and ELM is established for low frequency IMFs. Finally, the predicted value of carbon price is reconstructed to complete the prediction. The experimental results show that the proposed model has best prediction accuracy, and provides a new method for carbon price prediction. © 2021 The Authors"

Recently published articles based on high-frequency data fail to disentangle efficient market price variance from microstructure noise, which produces biased estimates of announcements’ market impacts. By using a Markov Chain framework, we address the shortcomings of previous research and assess the market response to key public information releases affecting agricultural markets. We compare two mechanisms to release public information that have been used in these markets: the trading halt and the real-time. We show how the value of microstructure noise can be used to improve public policy decisions. We find that the real-time release of information brings faster efficient price discovery at the cost of large microstructure frictions. Increases in the cost of noise are not compensated by the improvements in the speed of efficient price discovery. Overall, our findings are highly relevant to public policy and have implications for market design. © 2021 Elsevier B.V."

Given the fact that communications in numerous IoT devices through wireless links are unreliable, blockchain technology, as a promising solution, has emerged to achieve reliable and secure sharing services in a decentralized manner. However, applying blockchain in large-scale wireless networks confronts scalability challenges. This motivates us to propose a real-time, trusted data interactive, and fine-grained transaction supportable sharing framework, the core of which is a novel two-layer scaling blockchain design. In the on-chain layer, sharing-oriented sharding is employed to enable secure and efficient processing of macro-transactions on the chain. In the off-chain layer, cross-zone off-chain channels are set up to provide real-time sharing transactions with high-frequency micro-trading scenarios.

In this context, this paper provides two fast and tight approximations for the Gaussian cumulative distribution function which takes continuous input values and provides a wide range of precision values correct up to O(10 - 5). These approximations eliminate the existing finite precision and discrete tabulated values with the real-valued computations. We derive accurate and tight option price by exploiting these approximations, which are in excellent agreement with the exact option price under a wide range of volatilities and time periods. It also operates well on the risk hedging metrics such as option greeks. Further, this framework can be employed for accurate and fast computation of pricing, designing of replicating portfolio, and dynamic hedging purposes which in turn reduces arbitrage in HFT. Finally, we discuss time-dependent Fokker–Planck equation corresponding to geometric brownian motion stochastic differential equation and derive steady-state solution in terms of lognormal probability density function which helps to compute the aforementioned option price models. © 2021, Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management."

Recent studies have shown that the DL methods are superior to the ML methods in stock prediction because they can extract important features for prediction. There is no existing study on stock prediction that profiles stocks. This can be overgeneralised as it predicts each stock equally when they have similar historical price movements. Moreover, the existing high-frequency stock price prediction models do not consider learning the long-term information. The objective of this study is to find out whether profiling the stocks and extending the length of the input data can further improve the prediction accuracy. The method used for this study is ESET-ConvNet, a method, which is proposed to combine two existing models, TCN and SENet with an additional embedding layer to learn the embedding of each stock.

The ability of speed traders to submit 4:00-pm-news orders to the auction through the continuous session earns them up to 1.5 percent profit and creates an unlevel playing field because most auction participants are not allowed to cancel their orders.

In this paper, taking 17 years' high-frequency data of the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index (SSEC) as an example, we set out to propose a novel model of multifractal clustering model (MCM), combining multifractal algorithm with k-mean clustering algorithm, to measure the multi-volatility states of financial markets. The empirical results present that the financial markets are multifractal and the multifractal parameter Sα measured by multifractal algorithm correlates well with the performance of financial markets. Meanwhile, the multi-volatility states recognized by k-mean clustering algorithm based on Sα have obvious statistical significance. More importantly, the experiment results show that by the loss functions and Diebold–Mariano (DM) test, generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model with the multi-volatility state measured by MCM is superior to others measured by Markov switching (MRS) model and hidden Markov model (HMM) as well as that without the multi-volatility states, which indicates that MCM has best performance of measuring the multi-volatility states of financial markets. The robustness of MCM is also evaluated by Shenzhen Securities Component Index (SZSE) instance set, SSEC instance sets with different time intervals, and different volatility models. The results still prove that MCM has strong robustness on measuring the multi-volatility states of financial markets. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Although the existing literature has analyzed the economic impact of the pandemic on the airline industry from different perspectives, it remains to be further studied given the operating characteristics of different types of airlines in China. Methods: Using a new perspective of heterogeneous airline service models, this study collects high-frequency data on stock prices on six sample airline companies (including both full-service airlines and low-cost airlines) in China over 519 trading days, from August 1, 2019 to September 15, 2021, and identifies structural change points for each company's stock price using the Quandt-Andrews test. The outcome is used to construct an econometric model to quantify the economic impact of the pandemic on different airlines' stock prices under different structural changes. Results: All results have passed the Quandt-Andrews test. The impact coefficient of full-service airlines is negative, while that of low-cost airlines is positive. Most of them have passed the test at the significance level of 10%. Conclusions: All Chinese airlines experienced significant sudden changes in stock prices due to the pandemic, but there are sectoral differences in the order of the sudden changes, with full-service airlines experiencing structural changes much earlier than low-cost airlines. In addition, the impact of the pandemic on stock prices varies across airline types, with a negative impact on full-service airlines and a significant positive effect on most low-cost airlines.

Nowadays, different energy markets add the extra challenge of requiring predictions at the minute level a day forward for bidding-processes.

In this context, we present a novel approach to predict power generation at high frequencies one day in advance, which handles constraints such as curtailment and turbine degradation. This has been tested over historical data from SCADA systems and historical forecasts from wind speed providers for eight windfarm locations in Ireland over two years. Our work was performed in two phases. First, we undertook a preliminary study to analyse the relationship between all combinations of observed wind, forecasted wind and electrical power. Secondly, a wide variety of Machine Learning algorithms were run over each of the locations in order to assess the degrees of predictability of different algorithms and regions. Most of the algorithms benchmarked improve linear wind to power mappings besides the high degree of noise in this domain. Our analysis and experimental results show how boosting ensembles are a cost-effective solution in terms of runtime among other Machine Learning algorithms predicting wind power a day ahead. © 2022 The Authors"

Fast markets are modelled as contests with the possibility of multiple winners where the probability of casting the best quote depends on prior technology investments. Depending on the market design, equilibrium pricing by intermediaries involves a trade-off, between monopolistic price distortion and excess volatility. Since equilibrium at the pricing stage generates an externality, investments into faster trading technologies are necessarily asymmetric in equilibrium, akin to markets with vertical product differentiation. Further, equilibrium is not necessarily efficient, since it is possible that a high-cost intermediary ends up investing excessively and thus trades more frequently than low-cost rivals. © 2022 The Author(s)"

This paper reviews the most important papers published in recent years that use the most advanced techniques to forecast financial asset trends and answer the question of whether those techniques can be used to successfully trade the complex financial markets. All systems use deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) protocols to explore nonobvious correlations and phenomena that influence the probability of trading success.

Therefore, it is necessary to optimize energy storage configuration to smooth the wind power, so as to meet the requirements of grid connection. In order to deal with the large energy storage capacity caused by poor tracking of the moving average method, a hierarchical moving average method was proposed to determine the target in smoothing wind power. The wind power offset was decomposed by a Butterworth low-pass filter, and the low-frequency and high-frequency components were used as the reference power of lithium battery energy storage and flywheel energy storage, respectively. In view of the cost of initial investment and replacement of energy storage as well as the revenue from electricity sales and carbon trading, an optimal configuration model of hybrid energy storage capacity for wind farms was established and solved by an adaptive chaotic particle swarm optimization algorithm. Simulation and verification were carried out according to the operation data of a 48MW wind farm. The simulation results show that the hierarchical moving average method is more suitable for determining the target in smoothing wind power, and the hybrid energy storage of lithium battery and flywheel can improve the net income of the energy storage system of wind farms in the whole life cycle. © 2022 The authors."

However, clustering algorithms ignore the notion of biclustering, that is, grouping of stocks only within a subset of times rather than over the entire time period. Biclustering algorithms enable grouping of stocks and times simultaneously, and thus facilitate improved pattern extraction for informed trading strategies. While biclustering methods may be employed for grouping low-frequency (daily) financial data, their use with high-frequency financial time series of intra-day trading data is especially useful. This paper develops a biclustering algorithm based on pairwise or groupwise mutual information between one-minute averaged stock returns within a trading day, using jackknife estimation of mutual information (JMI). We construct a multiple day time series biclustering (MI-MDTSB) algorithm that can capture refined and local comovement patterns between groups of stocks over a subset of continuous time points.

Even though the proposed estimators have distinctive properties, it is not clear which one has a better performance in terms of unbiasedness and consistency. Some of them are robust to microstructure noise only, and others are robust solely to price jumps, whereas a few of them are robust to both. Therefore, the main purpose is finding a benchmark estimator among alternative competitors, as the best proxy of integrated variance, and empirical demonstration of its superiority. The vast majority of the existing studies largely rely on developed US data or simulation data, but inferences obtained on such data might deviate from European developed markets. This study aims to fill in that niche. In particular, the optimal sampling frequency of proposed benchmark estimator is determined with respect to the trade-off between its bias and the variance of each stock index individually. Afterwards, probability integral transformation, Mincer– Zarnowitz regression and upper tail correlation from appropriate copula function are considered as an adequate pairwise comparison methods. Notable contributions of this paper include unambiguously proven superiority of robust two times scaled estimator for selected European developed markets within the range of optimal slow time frequency from 10 to 30 s. Finally, recommendations for research and practitioners regarding the usage of jump robust two times scaled estimator are given. In fact, asset managers, institutional investors as well as market regulators could benefit from proposed realized volatility benchmark in making long-term investment decisions, leading to sustainable finance. © 2022 by the authors.

The characteristics of the stock price series such as nonlinearity, high noise, and strong time-varying degrade the prediction performance of the existing methods. To address this issue, we present a stock price movement prediction model called TE-EAN, based on the empirical mode decomposition of technical factors and embedded temporal attention network. This model first uses the empirical mode decomposition to decompose the traditional technical factors into some high-frequency and low-frequency sequences. We then map the decomposed sequences with obvious trend characteristics into a new representation space, and learn time-dependent hidden embeddings by means of deep-layer gated recurrent units. Finally, the time attention mechanism is used to adaptively aggregate information derived from different times to reduce information redundancy and accurately predict the stock price movement. In addition, aiming at the time-varying characteristics of stock price data, we apply the sequential iterative update of the parameters to further improve the accuracy of prediction. The experimental results on 25 randomly selected stocks in the CSI300 Index show the effctiveness of the proposed model in predicting the stock price movement. The AUC of our model is up to 0.732. © 2022, Editorial Board of Journal of Systems Engineering Society of China. All right reserved."

The aim of this work was to analyse the static and spatial characteristics of the pig network, to identify its trading communities and to study the contribution of the network to the transmission of classical swine fever. In this regard, we used the pig movement records from the National Veterinary Service of Ecuador (2017–2019), using social network analysis and spatial analysis to construct a network with registered premises as nodes and their movements as edges. Furthermore, we also created a network of parishes as its nodes by aggregating their premises movements as edges. The annual network metrics showed an average diameter of 20.33, a number of neighbours of 2.61, a shortest path length of 4.39 and a clustering coefficient of 0.38 (small-world structure). The most frequent movements were to or from markets (55%). Backyard producers made up 89% of the network premises, and the top 2% of parishes (highest degree) contributed to 50% of the movements. The highest frequencies of movements between parishes were in the centre of the country, while the highest frequency of movements to abattoirs was in the south-west. Finally, the pattern of classical swine fever (CSF) disease outbreaks within the Ecuador network was likely the result of network transmission processes. In conclusion, our results represented the first exploratory analysis of domestic pig movements at premise and parish levels. The surveillance system could consider these results to improve its procedures and update the disease control and management policy, and allow the implementation of targeted or risk-based surveillance. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH."

The result shows that the embodied net carbon transfer network of global agricultural trade is densely connected, the spatial correlation spillover effect is significant, and the edge of the network core structure is clear. On the one hand, the top four countries or regions in terms of embodied carbon outflow in agricultural trade are the USA, Australia, Vietnam, and China. On the other hand, the top four countries or regions of embodied carbon inflow are Malaysia, Central Africa, Singapore, and Serbia. From the perspective of outdegree, indegree, proximity centrality, and intermediary centrality, Cambodia, the Netherlands, Vietnam, Ghana, and South Africa, with the high frequency of the shortest path of the globally embodied net carbon transfer network, have a strong influence and linking facility in spatial correlation and have a strong control ability to the spatial correlation of other countries or regions. The embodied carbon emission network of global agricultural trade can be divided into four sectors: main spillover, two-way spillover, broker, and main benefit. The main spillover segment, constituted by the USA, India, Germany, and China, has significant embodied carbon spillover effects on the internal segment and other segments. It is the main embodied carbon spillover sector of embodied net carbon transfer of global agricultural trade.

Options quotations at a different trading time, such as the opening period, midday period and closing period of a trading day with one-month, two months’ and three months’ maturity, are employed to compute intraday IV for pricing currency options. We use the Mincer–Zarnowitz regression test to analyse the volatility forecast power of IV for three different forecast horizons (within a week, one week and one month). Intraday IV’s capability in estimating currency options price is measured by the mean squared error, mean absolute error and mean absolute percentage error measure. The empirical findings show that intraday IV is the key to accurately forecasting volatility and estimating currency options prices precisely. Moreover, IV at the closing period of the beginning of the week contains crucial information for options price estimation. Furthermore, the shorter maturity intraday IV is suitable for pricing options for a shorter horizon.

The present work investigates the issue of the critical dynamics of a financial complex system approaching a crash, by using the Method of Critical Fluctuation (MCF) which is known for its ability to uncover critical dynamics. Specifically, we study the recent crash that took place in the cryptocurrency market (starting on 12 May 2021), by analyzing the “Contracts for Difference” (CFDs) prices on Bitcoin/USD (Bitcoin to US-Dollar exchange rate) at five different high frequency trading time intervals (60, 30, 15, 5 and 1 min). The results show that, for the 60-min and 30-min sampling intervals, a specific sequence of indications is identified, in agreement to the evolution towards extreme events in other complex systems, such as earthquakes. This sequence of indications isn't maintained as the sampling frequency is increased. Notably, the existence of critical dynamics during the system's evolution has been detected both in equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium by means of the same analysis method (MCF).

Simulation results corroborate our theoretical findings demonstrating clear advantage of our method over an existing distribution-free method that does not take microstructure noise into account.

The agents who place the orders follow different strategies. Agents who follow the same strategy have coordinated behavior, even if they do not share information—this is tacit collusion (explicit collusion happened during the GameStop and other short squeezes). We look at incoming orders that are composed of a given number of agents that can range from one to ten thousand. It is assumed that each incoming order is a result of a trigger from a particular strategy. A square root price impact function is used to determine the effect on price as a result of the order. The profit of an agent is determined from this price change since they are high-frequency traders. The model produces power-law distributions for individual quantity, aggregate quantity, and price-change, and we fit three stocks to the model by adjusting the temperature. When the market reflects reversion-to-the-mean behavior, the distributions appear to have lighter tails than when the market reflects the hot-hand behavior. The higher risk of heavier tails is seen to be a result of hot-hand trading behavior for this model. The model also has a phase transition in the hot-hand component, in the sense of a nonanalyticity, where the order parameter is the exponent of the power-law tail of the c.d.f. function for aggregate quantity Q. This order parameter is a function of the temperature, varies linearly with inverse temperature in a high-temperature region, and varies nonlinearly in a low-temperature region. The relationship predicted between temperature and aggregate volume has been validated by data from the GameStop short squeeze. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."

We consider multiple marked point processes with intensities defined by three multiplicative components, namely a common baseline intensity, a state-dependent component specific to each process, and a state-dependent component specific to each mark within each process. We show that for specific mark distributions, this model is a combination of the ratio models defined in Muni Toke and Yoshida (2020). We prove convergence results for the quasi-maximum and quasi-Bayesian likelihood estimators of this model and provide numerical illustrations of the asymptotic variances. We use these ratio processes to model transactions occurring in a limit order book. Model flexibility allows us to investigate both state-dependency (emphasizing the role of imbalance and spread as significant signals) and clustering. Calibration, model selection and prediction results are reported for high-frequency trading data on multiple stocks traded on Euronext Paris.

Therefore, this paper proposes an optimal hybrid forecasting framework to ensure accurate long-term carbon price series predictions for which empirical mode decomposition (EMD) was used to decompose the original data and a novel optimal combination developed to predict each decomposed part, which involved the integration of autoregressive moving average-type (ARMA-type) models and least squares support vector machines (LSSVMs) optimized by 10-fold cross validation and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The effectiveness of the optimal EMD-ARMAs-LSSVMs framework was then verified using an empirical example from the EU emissions trading system (EU ETS). The long-term forecast results and comparisons with other forecasting methods demonstrated the stability and validity of the proposed framework. The results indicated that ARMA-type models are more suitable for low frequency and trend components, and LSSVMs were more suitable for high frequency components. It was also found that the proposed optimal framework was able to effectively reduce the error accumulation. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

A market maker should consider three types of risk: 1) inventory risk, 2) adverse selection risk, and 3) non-execution risk. While there have been a lot of studies on market making via deep reinforcement learning, most of them focus on the first risk. However, in highly competitive markets, the latter two risks are very important to make stable profit from market making. For better control of the latter two risks, it is important to reserve good queue position of their resting limit orders. For this purpose, practitioners frequently adopt order stacking framework where their limit orders are quoted at multiple price levels beyond the best limit price. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no studies that adopt order stacking framework for market making. In this regard, we develop a deep reinforcement learning model for market making under order stacking framework. We use a modified state representation to efficiently encode the queue positions of the resting limit orders. We conduct comprehensive ablation study to show that by utilizing deep reinforcement learning, a market making agent under order stacking framework successfully learns to improve the PL while reducing various risks.

This topic is not specifically examined in the existing literature; nonetheless, the behavior of the market microstructure is quite different at the subsecond scale. Indeed, below a certain psychological time threshold, most factors typically influencing price changes cease to apply. This paper analyzes several parameters considered to affect price changes and identifies four of them as potentially influencing VSTPC. These factors are previous volatility, scarce liquidity, high quantity exchanged, and stop-loss (SL) orders (seldom mentioned in the literature). These four parameters are examined by means of a mathematical model, audit trail data analysis, Granger-causality testing, and agent-based model. The results of these four techniques converge to suggest a nonlinear combination of previous volatility, liquidity, and SL orders as the main causes of excess volatility. However, contrary to mainstream literature on trading time above a certain psychological threshold, the volumes exchanged are not integral agents for VSTPC. Currently, financial markets face many ultrafast orders, yet a coherent theory of price change at time scales incomprehensible by humans and only manageable by computers is still lacking. The theory presented in this paper attempts to fill this gap. The outcome of such a theory is important for purposes of market stability, crisis avoidance, investment planning, risk management, and high-frequency trading. © 2022, The Author(s)."

In this paper, the power-law distribution that the Bitcoin network obeys is given with mathematical proof, while traditional de-anonymous methods such as clustering fail to satisfy it. Therefore, considering the profit-oriented characteristics of Bitcoin traders in such occasion, we put forward a de-anonymous heuristic approach that recognizes and analyzes the behavioral patterns of financial High-Frequency Transactions(HFT), with realtime exchange rate of Bitcoin involved. With heuristic approach used for de-anonymity, algorithm that deals with the adjacency matrix and transition probability matrix are also put forward, which then makes it possible to apply clustering to the IP matching method. Basing on the heuristic approach and additional algorithm for clustering, finally we established the de-anonymous method that matches the activity information of the IP with the transaction records in blockchain. Experiments on IP matching method are applied to the actual data. It turns out that similar behavioral pattern between IP and transaction records are shown, which indicates the superiority of IP matching method.  © 2013 China Institute of Communications."

The recent U.S. equity and treasury flash crashes can be viewed as two high-profile manifestations of such dynamics, but we argue that drift bursts of varying magnitude are an expected and regular occurrence in financial markets that can arise through established mechanisms of liquidity provision. We show how to build drift bursts into the continuous-time Itô semimartingale model, elaborate on the conditions required for the process to remain arbitrage-free, and propose a nonparametric test statistic that identifies drift bursts from noisy high-frequency data. We apply the test and demonstrate that drift bursts are a stylized fact of the price dynamics across equities, fixed income, currencies and commodities. Drift bursts occur once a week on average, and the majority of them are accompanied by subsequent price reversion and can thus be regarded as “flash crashes.” The reversal is found to be stronger for negative drift bursts with large trading volume, which is consistent with endogenous demand for immediacy during market crashes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."

Accelerated digital disruption and abusive trading behaviors, such as the GameStop mania, prompt regulatory changes. It is unclear how this “democratization” of trading power affects market fairness as economies cope with pandemic-driven shifts in basic systems. Excessive speculation and market manipulation undermine the quality of financial markets in the sense that they cause volatility and increase the pain of bubble and crash events. Thereby, they weaken public confidence in financial markets to fulfill their roles in proper capital allocation to irrigate the real economy and generate value for society. While previous studies have mostly focused on market efficiency, our study proposes a tool to improve market fairness, even under periods of stress. To encourage value generation and improve market quality, we advance a graduated Non-Value-Added Tax that we implement in an agent-based model that can realistically capture the properties of real-world financial markets. A profitable transaction is taxed at a higher rate if it does not enhance the efficiency measured by deviation from fundamentals. When an agent locks in profit not supported by fundamentals but driven by trend-following strategies, the generated profit is taxed at various rates under the Non-Value-Added Tax regime. Unlike existing financial transaction taxes, the non-value-added tax is levied on profit rather than on price or volume. We show that the proposed tax encourages profitable trades that add value to the market and discourages valueless profit-making. It significantly curtails volatility and prevents the occurrence of extreme market events, such as bubbles and crashes. © 2022, The Author(s)."

Our analysis of intra-day data exhibited the presence of an anti-persistence effect, following the popular conclusion of momentum and speculative trading in the Bitcoin market. The second section of this study evaluated whether Bitcoin played the role of a hedge and an asset of protection in a global portfolio manager’s portfolio during extreme market volatility. Using the Threshold GARCH (TGARCH), we evaluated the trading correlation between Bitcoin prices and four major indices, namely S & P 500, FTSE, Hang Seng, and Nikkei, on daily and weekly data. We identified the time-varying hedge and safety properties of Bitcoin: Volatility, speculation, less-traded history, and lack of regulatory infrastructure. Our findings added to the literature by testing the efficiency of Bitcoin in major developed economies using returns of high-frequency data, along with daily returns. We also considered extreme movements in the currency to check its hedging and protection properties in a portfolio of developed market stocks.

This trial is essential to build a more reliable simulation because the reliability of models is a fundamental issue in the increasing use of simulations. Thus, we tried to build a behavior model of financial traders through the traders’ future action predicting using the actual order data. This study focused on one category of traders employing high-frequency market-making (HFT-MM) trading in financial markets. In our experiments, we build models for predicting the next actions of each trader and evaluate how correctly these models successfully predict trades’ future actions in the next one minutes. Although the task is the same as previous work, this study newly used an architecture based on the transformer and residual block, and a loss function based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD). In addition, we established a new evaluation metric. Consequently, our new models, both transformer-based and residual-block-based models, outperformed the previous model based on LSTM in terms of both old and new evaluation metrics. These results suggested that transformer and residual block are effective in capturing traders’ behaviors. In addition, the KLD-based new loss function also showed better results than the previous MSE-based loss function. We assumed it is because the KLD-based loss function has a better fitting to this task due to its mathematical form. © 2021, Ohmsha, Ltd. and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature."

To characterize this empirical property, we develop a multifactor regime-switching duration (MF-RSD) model, in which the modes of inter-trade durations are characterized as regimes and the transitions of regimes are determined by LOB-factor-dependent transition probability matrices. Using the model, we analyze the impact of LOB factors on inter-trade duration dynamics and find that the bimodal phenomenon is caused by the switchings of traders’ trading strategies between market making and price speculation. Our empirical studies show that the MF-RSD model not only produces good in-sample fit but also outperforms some benchmark models in out-of-sample predictions of inter-trade durations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."

By continuously monitoring the spread value between a pair of stocks whose prices are statistically correlated, traders are able to make profit when the spread deviates from its historical mean. Thus, it is useful to predict the spread movement in order to identify opportunities to buy and sell stocks. Previous pairs trading works mainly develop strategies based on spread values or stock prices. Limit order book (LOB), comprising buy and sell orders over time, is able to reflect the market intention, and thus, is highly related to the formation of stock price as well as spread value. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no prior work using the LOB data to design pairs trading models. In this paper, we make the first attempt to study the spread movement prediction problem for pairs trading by utilizing not only the spread data but also the high-frequency LOB data. We propose a deep learning model that is capable of extracting representative features from both the spread history and the LOB data, and further exploits the dynamic inter-dependencies between them to sophisticate the spread movement prediction. For evaluation, we collect the historical tick data of the 147 companies from Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (TAIEX).

LPS requires participants to submit buy and sell orders at the European best bid and offer quotes with a size larger than 50,000 Swedish Krona on each trade side. LPS delivers liquidity improvements by reducing order processing costs in the large-cap and cross-listed stocks in the NOMX and Chi-X markets, with no evidence of market liquidity migration from Chi-X to NOMX. As market makers registered with LPS are likely high-frequency traders, LPS stabilizes market liquidity as market makers’ decisions to supply or demand liquidity become less sensitive to market conditions like the spread and order imbalance. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Often high-frequency stock behavior in the financial market is a prerequisite for investors to make effective investment strategies. Besides, the existing solution to the traditional stock movement prediction is generally converted into a classification task, which affects the practicability of the model. In this paper, we propose a Kernel-based Hybrid Interpretable Transformer(KHIT) model, which combines with a novel loss function to cope with the prediction task of non-stationary stock markets. Specifically, inspired by the Donchian price channels theory, we propose an adaptive renormalization kernel function that converts the original binary classification task (Rise or Fall) into the time-series prediction. Furthermore, we design a multi-order differential sequence loss function to identify the movement of high-frequency stock in future multi-scale periods. Finally, based on the Information Bottleneck (IB) theory and Transformer structure, we introduce the tensor decomposition and interpretable attention mechanism for improving the discrimination to the multi-types factors and the interpretability of our model. To be the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to achieve the high-frequency stock movement prediction task rather than classification. Experimental results show our proposed model outperforms several competitive methods in stock movement prediction on two non-stationary datasets.  © 2022 IEEE."

Highly reliable data from Nasdaq identifies the trade direction of each trade and the trades that have HFT participation. To determine if trades executed by high or low frequency traders are more frequently associated with a price jump, we use the volume-synchronised probability of informed trading [VPIN] metric. We find that VPIN rapidly increases prior to a price jump but does not peak until after a price jump. HFT liquidity demand and supply prior to a price jump shows that HFT reduce their trading prior to price jumps. Low frequency traders hence remain as the main market participants during price jumps and are the information channel that leads to price jumps. Regulators and broker–dealers can implement strategies to protect investors against price jumps when VPIN rapidly increases and the proportion of HFT to other traders falls. © 2021 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland"

Consequently, if one considers for example that log-prices follow an fBm, one can exploit the non-Markovian nature of the fBm to forecast future states of the process and make statistical arbitrages. We provide new insights into forecasting an fBm, by proposing theoretical formulas for accuracy metrics relevant to a systematic trader, from the hit ratio to the expected gain and risk of a simple strategy. In addition, we answer some key questions about optimizing trading strategies in the fBm framework: Which lagged increments of the fBm, observed in discrete time, are to be considered? If the predicted increment is close to zero, up to which threshold is it more profitable not to invest? We also propose empirical applications on high-frequency FX rates, as well as on realized volatility series, exploring the rough volatility concept in a forecasting perspective. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Although convolutions offer efficiency by restricting their operations to local interactions, it is at the cost of potentially missing out on the detection of long-range dependencies. Recent studies address this problem by employing additional recurrent or attention layers that increase computational complexity. In this work, we propose Axial-LOB, a novel fully-attentional deep learning architecture for predicting price movements of stocks from LOB data. By utilizing gated position-sensitive axial attention layers our architecture is able to construct feature maps that incorporate global interactions, while significantly reducing the size of the parameter space. Unlike previous works, Axial-LOB does not rely on hand-crafted convolutional kernels and hence has stable performance under input permutations and the capacity to incorporate additional LOB features. The effectiveness of Axial-LOB is demonstrated on a large benchmark dataset, containing time series representations of millions of high-frequency trading events, where our model establishes a new state of the art, achieving an excellent directional classification performance at all tested prediction horizons. © 2022 IEEE."

For the first time, a neural network learns the mapping between the preferences of the trader, i.e. risk aversion parameters, and the optimal controls. An important challenge in learning this mapping is that, in intra-day trading, trader's actions influence price dynamics in closed loop via the market impact. The exploration–exploitation tradeoff generated by the efficient execution is addressed by tuning the trader's preferences to ensure long enough trajectories are produced during the learning phase. The issue of scarcity of financial data is solved by transfer learning: the neural network is first trained on trajectories generated thanks to a Monte-Carlo scheme, leading to a good initialization before training on historical trajectories. Moreover, to answer to genuine requests of financial regulators on the explainability of machine learning generated controls, we project the obtained ‘blackbox controls’ on the space usually spanned by the closed-form solution of the stylized optimal trading problem, leading to a transparent structure. For more realistic loss functions that have no closed-form solution, we show that the average distance between the generated controls and their explainable version remains small.

In stock price analysis, the prediction of short-term movements is of much interest to investors and traders. In this paper, we consider forecasting price movements based on ensembled machine learning models, which is generally viewed as a challenging task due to noise components inherent in the data and uncertainties in various forms of financial information related to stock prices. To enhance the accuracy of trend predictions, we propose to use wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) and kernel-based smoothing techniques to remove high-frequency noise from the data, based on which we further perform feature engineering to obtain a comprehensive list of multidimensional technical features. Subsequently, we employ the light gradient boosting machine (lightGBM) algorithm to classify the change in the direction of the price trend that occurs in ten trading days. Numerical results on the Shanghai composite index show that the proposed approach has noticeable advantages over traditional statistical and machine learning methods when predicting near term price trends.

Accurate prediction of volatility is crucial to maintaining profitable investments and trading strategies. Statistical models such as GARCH are used today to predict volatility and time series, though new methods are actively being researched to improve the prediction accuracy to cope with the rapidly increasing trading volumes and stock market influencing factors. The aim of this paper is to investigate a new method to improve market volatility forecasting accuracy by innovatively introducing a new setup of the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) algorithm. In particular, the proposed model is a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with multivariate input composed of multiple asset daily prices of different lag time-steps. The proposed model is used to predict volatility under different market conditions and is compared to the predictions obtained with GARCH as well as to the actual volatility of the same forecasting period. The results show that the prediction of the future realized volatility using a single feature LSTM has comparable accuracy to GARCH. They also indicate that a stacked LSTM can significantly improve the volatility prediction accuracy when configured with multivariate input of more than one asset and a lagging period of more than a day. A stacked multivariate LSTM setup enables the prediction model to capture complex patterns in the time series data of assets prices and provides a superior alternative to statistical models in volatility modelling and prediction. The proposed multivariate LSTM architecture clearly shows faster and more accurate modelling of daily volatility and therefore can be used for intra-day modelling specifically for high frequency trading environments. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

This allows the researcher to observe both winners and losers in a race, whereas in limit order book data you cannot see the losers, so you cannot directly see the races. We find that latency arbitrage races are very frequent (about one per minute per symbol for FTSE 100 stocks), extremely fast (the modal race lasts 5-10 millionths of a second), and account for a remarkably large portion of overall trading volume (about 20%). Race participation is concentrated, with the top six firms accounting for over 80% of all race wins and losses. The average race is worth just a small amount (about half a price tick), but because of the large volumes the stakes add up. Our main estimates suggest that races constitute roughly one-third of price impact and the effective spread (key microstructure measures of the cost of liquidity), that latency arbitrage imposes a roughly 0.5 basis point tax on trading, that market designs that eliminate latency arbitrage would reduce the market's cost of liquidity by 17%, and that the total sums at stake are on the order of $5 billion per year in global equity markets alone.  © 2021 The Author(s).

It is an important basis for the pricing, asset allocation, risk management and trading strategy of financial derivatives. The generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model is a common instrument to modeling volatility of high-frequency financial time series, which is based on the aggregation characteristics of volatility. At the same time, Support vector regression (SVR) aims to fit a line/curve to data by minimizing a cost function, which is widely used in financial data analysis and prediction, and has good performance. In this paper, a hybrid model of GARCH model and SVR is proposed, in which particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to optimize hyperparameters of the support vector regression in the scope of constraint permission. In addition, we also introduce Fourier kernel GARCH-PSO-SVR, and use the Shanghai Composite Index data to evaluate the performance of various GARCH-PSO-SVR models in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and mean square error (MSE).

To overcome the imminent bandwidth bottleneck, free-space optics (FSO) is currently deemed as a key breakthrough towards next-generation ultra-high-capacity wireless links. As this technology matures, it is starting to find its place not only in future mobile access networks, but also in applications such as datacenter interconnections, satellite communications and high-frequency trading. To meet the ever-increasing demand for high-capacity links, future-proof FSO systems should seek maximum compatibility with state-of-The-Art optical fiber systems, which nowadays can already provide data rates per channel in the Terabit/s range. However, the ultra-wideband potential of FSO systems comes at the expense of very tight requirements in terms of optical beam alignment, so that reliable end-To-end communications can be ensured. Following this research challenge, in this work we demonstrate a dynamic single-wavelength 1 Tbps FSO link with high pointing error tolerance, boosted by adaptive probabilistic constellation shaping (PCS) and an active gimbal-based acquisition, tracking and pointing (ATP) mechanism. Our results demonstrate successful indoor FSO transmission over 3 m with enhanced resilience towards pointing errors, enabling to adapt the data rate in the range of 0.8-1 Tbps.  © 1983-2012 IEEE."

The endorsement of market efficiency suggests that investors cannot beat the market, while a rejection of market efficiency implies that investors can use HFT to realize higher returns than those of the market. We obtain data at the precision level of milliseconds from the Casablanca Stock Exchange and cover the period from August 1, 2016 (the beginning of high-frequency trading in the Moroccan stock market) to July 31, 2021. The chapter finds from conducting statistical analyses using this data that the market efficiency hypothesis is rejected at very high frequencies: one millisecond, one second, and 30 second. At lower time frequencies such as 1, 2, 5, 10, and 15 minutes, the market efficiency hypothesis is not rejected, which lends evidence that the market is efficient at these frequencies. Based on these results obtained, the main conclusion from this chapter is that investors with a faster market connection (at the millisecond and second level) and an efficient algorithm can use privileged information to realize returns higher than those of the Moroccan Stock Exchange market.

Despite the dominance of HFT, studies on the topic have been scarce outside of the United States. This study seeks to examine the effects of HFT on market quality in a South African context. First, the study makes use of a set of proxies for algorithmic trading (AT), namely average trade size, odd-lot volume ratio and trade-to-order volume ratio. Second, panel regressions are used to determine the relationship between these proxies and two measures of market quality (market liquidity and short-term volatility). The study found a strong positive relationship between market liquidity and average trade size but an inverse relationship with the other two AT proxies. Finally, the study confirmed a strong positive relationship with short-term volatility. The study concludes that, overall, AT has a positive impact on market quality, despite carrying the risk of causing instability in certain markets. © 2022 Investment Analysts Society of South Africa."

The forecasted durations are then used to demonstrate the practical usefulness of the ACD models in quantifying an intraday time-based risk measure. Design/methodology/approach: Through six functional forms and six error distributions, 36 ACD models are estimated for eight mid-cap ETFs. The Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion and the Ljung-Box test are used to evaluate goodness-of-fit while root mean square error and the Superior predictive ability test are applied to assess forecast accuracy. Findings: The Box-Cox ACD (BACD), augmented Box-Cox ACD (ABACD) and additive and multiplicative ACD (AMACD) extensions are among the best fits. The results obtained prove that higher degrees of flexibility do not necessarily enhance goodness of fit and forecast accuracy does not always depend on model adequacy. BACD and AMACD models based on the generalised-F distribution generate the best forecasts, irrespective of the trading frequencies of the ETFs. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study that analyses the empirical performance of ACD models for high-frequency ETF data. Additionally, in comparison to previous works, a wider range of ACD models is considered on a reasonably longer sample period.

However, limited by diffraction, the spatial resolution of conventional DHM is relatively low and incompatible with a wide field of view (FOV) owing to the spatial bandwidth product (SBP) limit of the imaging systems. During the past decades, many efforts have been made to enhance the spatial resolution of DHM while preserving a large FOV by trading with unused degrees of freedom. Illumination modulation techniques, such as oblique illumination, structured illumination, and speckle illumination, can enhance the resolution by adding more high-frequency information to the recording system. Resolution enhancement is also achieved by extrapolation of a hologram or by synthesizing a larger hologram by scanning the sample, the camera, or inserting a diffraction grating between the sample and the camera. For on-chip DHM, spatial resolution is achieved using pixel super-resolution techniques. In this paper, we review various resolution enhancement approaches in DHM and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches. It is our hope that this review will contribute to advancements in DHM and its practical applications in many fields. © The Author(s) 2022."

The price of cryptocurrencies is highly volatile and is prone to rapid swings within short periods of time. This behaviour makes them a high-risk and high-return financial asset.

This work explored the use of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), a neural network based non-linear sequence model, to propose a novel algorithmic trading strategy for cryptocurrencies. The proposed novel high frequency algorithmic trading strategy built over an LSTM based short-term price forecasting is used for Bitcoin and Ethereum. This simple, yet effective trading algorithm uses the network's price forecasts to make buy and short selling decisions for cryptocurrency based on certain set criteria. The proposed trading strategy gives positive returns when backtested on Bitcoin hourly prices taken from yahoo finance. We also verified the effectiveness of the trading strategy for Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency, based on the positive backtesting returns. As an extension to the study, the proposed strategy is applied on an even higher frequency (minute by minute) Bitcoin price data, and the strategy gives positive backtesting returns in this extended study.

However, the risks of securities market investment are also ubiquitous, and both individual stock investment and index investment face great risk exposures. Arbitrage investment is popular as an investment method with low risk and stable profits. Stocks are not allowed to be shorted in the Chinese stock market under the T+1 system. Arbitrage trading for individual stocks is difficult to carry out due to insufficient liquidity, suspension. Therefore, many arbitrage traders focus on the stock index futures market, where T+0 trading and short selling are allowed, and the liquidity is strong. As a type of low-risk investment strategy, arbitrage trading is suitable for multiple transactions to form the cumulative effect on profits. Therefore, high-frequency arbitrage is born and applied by many investors. As a good algorithm for asset comparison, stochastic dominance is widely used in the comparative analysis of the investment value of multiple assets. The ascending dominance and the descending dominance are to model the investment behaviors of risk averters and risk seekers, respectively. The first-order stochastic dominance means arbitrage opportunities, and the second-order and third-order stochastic dominance represent the investors′ utility difference and their preference over assets. Many investors conduct first-order dominance analysis based on historical data to study the market efficiency or arbitrage opportunities that have occurred. To make the model better suited to the distribution characteristics of high-frequency data, this paper improves the existing stochastic dominance testing method and proposes an interpolated grid asymmetric DD test method. The interpolated grid asymmetric DD test method conforms to the distribution characteristics of high-frequency data, and its grids do not overlap with the samples, which makes it has advantages over the asymmetric DD test method and the DD test method. Based on a new perspective, this paper predicts future arbitrage opportunities and arbitrage directions based on the momentum strategy for investor utility and preference. The specific approach is conducting the second-order and third-order stochastic dominance analysis on historical high-frequency data, and predicting the future arbitrage opportunities and arbitrage directions between the two assets based on the dominance results and the historical return rates. On this basis, we design a high-frequency arbitrage strategy among the three stock index futures in China, and the strategy makes trading decisions based on the predicted arbitrage directions among the three stock index futures. This paper conducts an empirical analysis based on the one-minute data of the main continuous contracts of China′s three major stock index futures from April 16, 2015 to September 25, 2020, with 324990 minutes in total. We evaluate the investment performance of each arbitrage strategy based on eight evaluation indicators, namely annualized return rate, Karma ratio, Sharpe ratio, average daily win rate, average win rate each time, profit-loss ratio, maximum drawdown rate and maximum drawdown period rate. This paper studies the second-order ascending, second-order descending, third-order ascending, and third-order descending dominance separately. So there are 4 experimental groups. We take the DD test method, asymmetric DD test method and spread regression model as baseline models. Besides, the relationship between the return rate of each model and the average price change rate per minute is also studied in this paper. From the empirical results, we find that the average annualized return rates of the interpolated grid asymmetric DD test method, asymmetric DD test method, DD test method and spread regression strategy are 24. 19%, 23. 62%, 17. 07% and 15. 98% respectively. Besides, their average annual return rates of the second-order dominance strategies are higher than that of the third-order dominance strategies by 5. 64%, 3. 09% and 3. 20%, respectively. Their average annualized return rates of the ascending dominance strategies are 1. 49%, 0. 02% and 1. 43% higher than that of the descending dominance strategies, respectively. The empirical results show that the arbitrage strategies for stock index futures based on the stochastic dominance tests have achieved excellent and stable investment performance, which proves that our proposed arbitrage forecasting model and the arbitrage strategy of stock index futures based on the stochastic dominance test are effective. We can also find from the empirical results that the investment performance of the interpolated grid asymmetric DD test method is better than that of all other baseline models, which also verifies the improvement of our proposed interpolated grid asymmetric DD test method over existing researches. The empirical results show that the investment performance of the second-order dominance model is better than that of the third-order dominance model, and the investment performance of the ascending dominance is better than that of the descending dominance. The empirical results also reveal three market laws as follows. First, the investment performances of the second-order dominance models are better than that of the third-order dominance models, which shows that the second-order dominance reflects investors′ preferences for different stock index futures better than the third-order dominance. Second, the investment performance of the ascending dominance models is better than that of the descending dominance models, which shows that risk averters get more profits in arbitrage trading than risk seekers. Third, the profits of all arbitrage strategies are roughly positively correlated with the average price change rate of stock index futures per minute. The main innovations of this paper are as follows. Firstly, this paper improves the existing stochastic dominance test method according to the characteristics of high-frequency financial data and proposes the interpolated grid asymmetric DD test method. Secondly, we propose a forecasting model of arbitrage direction for stock index futures based on stochastic dominance tests and forms an equal-weight hedging high-frequency arbitrage strategy. The academic value of this paper is as follows. First, this paper enriches the high-frequency arbitrage strategies of stock index futures, by finding arbitrage opportunities and construct arbitrage portfolios from the stochastic dominance relationship between two stock index futures.

We explore a sharp uptrend in HFT activities and accompanying improvement in market liquidity in the European market. We show that alternative HFT proxies built on LOB are not equally powerful. The HFT proxy defined on the five best LOB prices (the mid point of a typical limit order book) provides a better HFT identification than the one popularly defined on the first best prices (BBO). We suggest that picking the LOB information beyond a certain level (e.g., the best five prices) of market depth in developing HFT proxy is counterintuitive.

However, this is an insignificant part of financial trading. By far, the greater part is now handled by high-speed computers, which make buying and selling decisions in fractions of a millisecond, accumulating minimal differences in value to enormous profits and significantly influencing the financial sector and, from there, labor and goods markets (Gsell 2010; Gresser 2016, 2018). Financial economists such as Bernard Lietaer assume that a key moment in the financial crisis of 2007, which began with the collapse of the Lehman Brothers investment bank, was due less to the greed of managers and speculators than to the hyper-efficiency of high frequency trading: “Natural river systems become sustainable because nature does not strive for maximum efficiency, but for an optimal balance between efficiency and resilience” (Lietaer 2009, p. 157). According to Lietaer, the systems were too strongly trimmed for efficiency, and were therefore not sufficiently resilient. The collapse of the banks led to remarkable social problems behind the technical processes. Banks lost confidence and stopped lending money. The credit crunch also threatened to bring social life to a standstill, and could only be averted by massive state guarantees and debt absorption by the taxpayer. Once again, this example shows that technical infrastructures have a strong influence on the world, determining how people experience the possibilities they have to realize their own lives, and how coexistence is shaped.

Spoofing is a new form of manipulation of the price of securities in the Capital Market characterized by the insertion of artificial purchase and sale orders, which are cancelled after thousandths of a second, but which change the trading price. However, the difficulty in characterizing the conduct and the specificities of high-frequency trading point to the risk of not obtaining adequate enforcement by CVM. Objective and Methodology: In this context, based on the deductive method and bibliographic review, the structure of the capital market is evaluated from the dissemination of high-frequency trading under the perspective of the literature about Market Microstructure. Thus, it will be possible to analyze the CVM's ability to deter spoofing. The Law and Economics literature will be used to determine if the standard of punishment by CVM in the case is capable of generating deterrent conduct and, in general, effective gains for the Brazilian capital market.

Hitherto, the rationale for the effectiveness of these positional encodings has been mainly studied through a Fourier lens. In this paper, we strive to broaden this understanding by showing that alternative non-Fourier embedding functions can indeed be used for positional encoding. Moreover, we show that their performance is entirely determined by a trade-off between the stable rank of the embedded matrix and the distance preservation between embedded coordinates. We further establish that the now ubiquitous Fourier feature mapping of position is a special case that fulfills these conditions. Consequently, we present a more general theory to analyze positional encoding in terms of shifted basis functions. In addition, we argue that employing a more complex positional encoding—that scales exponentially with the number of modes—requires only a linear (rather than deep) coordinate function to achieve comparable performance. Counter-intuitively, we demonstrate that trading positional embedding complexity for network deepness is orders of magnitude faster than current state-of-the-art; despite the additional embedding complexity. To this end, we develop the necessary theoretical formulae and empirically verify that our theoretical claims hold in practice.

Specifically, we examine three models, a revenue management model, an interest rate model with market sentiments, and a high-frequency trading equity market model, and consider possible extensions of those models to include social media. Since social media plays a substantial role in promoting products and services, engaging with customers, and sharing sentiments among market participants, it is important to include social media factors in the stochastic optimization models for financial management. Moreover, we compare the three models from a qualitative and quantitative point of view and provide managerial implications on how these models are synthetically used along with social media in financial management with a concrete case of a hotel REIT. The contribution of this research is that we investigate the possible incorporation of social media factors into the three models whose objectives are revenue management and debt and equity financing, essential areas in financial management, which helps to estimate the effect and the impact of social media quantitatively if internal data necessary for parameter estimation are available, and provide managerial implications for the synthetic use of the three models from a higher viewpoint.

This paper proposes a new model to measure quote volatility based on the point process and price-change duration. Specifically, we built a change-point intensity (CPI) model to describe the dynamics of price-change events for a given level of threshold. The instantaneous volatility of quote price can be calculated at any time according to price-change intensities. Based on this, we can quantify the cost of demanding liquidity for traders with different trading latency by using integrated variances. Furthermore, we use the autoregressive conditional intensity (ACI) model proposed by Russell (1999) as a benchmark comparison. The results suggest that our model has better performance of both in-sample fitness and out-of-sample prediction. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

Section II sets out what algorithmic trading is, how it is defined, which of its functions have a positive effect and which are negative for risk and impact. Section III examines how trading risks can be managed by human supervision. Section IV looks at how direct market intervention can mitigate the risks of algorithmic trading, focusing on the circuit breaker requirement.

Systemic risk and the propagation of shocks in financial markets is also a topic of great relevance that has attracted increasing attention in recent years. In the present work, we bridge the gap between these two topics with an in-depth investigation of the systemic risk structure of co-crashes in high frequency trading. We find that large co-crashes are systemic in their nature and differ from small ones. We demonstrate that there is a phase transition between co-crashes of small and large sizes, where the former involves mostly illiquid stocks, while large and liquid stocks are the most represented and central in the latter. This suggests that systemic effects and shock propagation might be triggered by simultaneous withdrawals or movement of liquidity by HFTs, arbitrageurs and market makers with cross-asset exposures. © 2022 by the authors.

As leading examples we consider the stochastic volatility of a latent efficient price process, the volatility of the latent noise that separates the efficient price from the actually observed price, and nonlinear transformations of these processes. Our estimation methods are decidedly nonparametric and consist of two steps: the estimation of the spot price and noise volatility processes based on pre-averaging techniques and in-fill asymptotic arguments, followed by a kernel-type estimation of the occupation densities. Our spot volatility estimates attain the optimal rate of convergence, and are robust to leverage effects, price and volatility jumps, general forms of serial dependence in the noise, and random irregular sampling. The convergence rates of our occupation density estimates are directly related to that of the estimated spot volatilities and the smoothness of the true occupation densities. An empirical application involving high-frequency equity data illustrates the usefulness of the new methods in illuminating time-varying risks, market liquidity, and informational asymmetries across time and assets. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."

We demonstrated, using rigorous statistical methods, that the truncated Weibull distribution describes the corresponding stochastic dynamics for the entire range of inter-arrival limit order waiting times, except for a region close to zero. However, since the truncated Weibull distribution was not able to describe the prodigious “zero-inflated” probability mass in the neighbourhood of zero (making up approximately 50% of the data for limit orders), it became clear that the entire probability distribution must be a mixture distribution of which the Weibull distribution is a significant part. To investigate this idea, we use a “censored expectation–maximization algorithm” to analyse the intertrade waiting times data for four selected stocks trading on the London Stock Exchange. The intertrade waiting times usually have a much lower percentage of zero inflation, typically around 2.5%. Making use of this new method and testing various mixture models, we show that the desired mixture consists of the Weibull distribution with the universal shape parameter of β≃0.57 plus an additional exponential distribution. This is the same value for the shape parameter found already in our previous study. The “1 exponential + 1 Weibull” mixture describes the intertrade waiting times extremely well at all time scales. While the Weibull component dominates in the transition and tail regions the exponential distribution explains the “zero-inflated” excess mass. © 2021 Elsevier B.V."

There have been many works using LOB data to make predictions, but these works do not distinguish between the orders of buyers and sellers. Intuitively, the transaction in the financial market is a process of the game between buyers and sellers, and it is important to represent the features of both sides. Inspired by this thought, in this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale deep learning model to represent the features of buyer and seller, respectively, and make predictions of the future trend of LOB data based on the changes in the features of both sides. Our model uses convolutional networks to extract the independent features of buyers and sellers and gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks to capture the market state. And it combines the features of both sides with the market state using the gating mechanism to represent features better.

A number of rules and barriers exist in the Chinese A-share market such as trading restrictions and high fees, as well as scarce and expensive hedging tools. It is difficult to achieve stable absolute returns in such a market. Stock correlation analysis and price prediction play an important role to achieve any profitable trading. The portfolio management and subsequent trading decisions highly depend on the results of stock correlation analysis and price prediction. However, it is nontrivial to analyze and predict any stocks, being time-varying and affected by unlimited factors in a given market. Traditional methods only take some certain factors into consideration but ignore others that may be changed dynamically. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning model named Graph Attention Long Short-Term Memory (GALSTM) to learn the correlations between stocks and predict their future prices automatically. First, a multi-Hawkes Process is used to initial a correlation graph between stocks. This procedure provides a good training start as the multi-Hawkes Processes will be studied on the most saint feature fluctuations with any correlations being statistically significant. Then an attention-based LSTM is built to learn the weighting matrix underlying the dynamic graph. In addition, we also build matching data process plus portfolio management modules to form a complete system. The proposed GALSTM enables us to expand the scope of stock selection under the premise of controlling risks with limited hedging tools in the A-share market, thereby effectively increasing high-frequency excess returns. We then construct a long and short positions combination, select long positions in the A shares of the entire market, and use stock index futures to short. With GALSTM model, the products managed by our fully automatic quantitative trading system achieved an absolute annual return rate of 44.71% and the standard deviation of daily returns is only 0.42% in three months of operation.

The aim of the research is to examine whether it is justified and to what extent to include Bitcoin in the portfolio of an institutional investor. The analysis includes data on the daily movement of selected action indices as well as the movement of Bitcoin. The methodology involves the analysis of high-frequency data, given that daily trading data were used. The results show that it is justified to include Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency in the portfolio structure. Also, the results show which share of Bitcoin in the portfolio is justified from the aspect of institutional investors. The data used in the analysis cover the period from 2020. The results of the research show that Bitcoin is a good source of diversification in a portfolio that contains traditional financial instruments, both for an investor who is not prone to risk, and for those investors who have a greater appetite for risk.

Nomadic populations moved across this wide area for millennia before developing more sedentary communities, extended empires, and complex trading networks, which connected western Eurasia and eastern Asia until the late Medieval period. We provided a fine-grained portrait of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation observed in present-day Mongolians and capable of revealing gene flows and other demographic processes that took place in Inner Asia, as well as in western Eurasia. The analyses of a novel dataset (N = 2,420) of mtDNAs highlighted a clear matrilineal differentiation within the country due to a mixture of haplotypes with eastern Asian (EAs) and western Eurasian (WEu) origins, which were differentially lost and preserved. In a wider genetic context, the prevalent EAs contribution, larger in eastern and central Mongolian regions, revealed continuous connections with neighboring Asian populations until recent times, as attested by the geographically restricted haplotype-sharing likely facilitated by the Genghis Khan’s so-called Pax Mongolica. The genetic history beyond the WEu haplogroups, notably detectable on both sides of Mongolia, was more difficult to explain. For this reason, we moved to the analysis of entire mitogenomes (N = 147). Although it was not completely possible to identify specific lineages that evolved in situ, two major changes in the effective (female) population size were reconstructed. The more recent one, which began during the late Pleistocene glacial period and became steeper in the early Holocene, was probably the outcome of demographic events connected to western Eurasia. The Neolithic growth could be easily explained by the diffusion of dairy pastoralism, as already proposed, while the late glacial increase indicates, for the first time, a genetic connection with western Eurasian refuges, as supported by the unusual high frequency and internal sub-structure in Mongolia of haplogroup H1, a well-known post-glacial marker in Europe. Bronze Age events, without a significant demographic impact, might explain the age of some mtDNA haplogroups. Finally, a diachronic comparison with available ancient mtDNAs made it possible to link six mitochondrial lineages of present-day Mongolians to the timeframe and geographic path of the Silk Route.

Asymmetric information influences stock prices with varying degree of investors’ perception. Estimation of asymmetric information cost and its determinants have been explored significantly under low-frequency trading. The literature hardly attempts to study asymmetric information cost under high-frequency trading (HFT). Asymmetric information cost significantly influences bid-ask spread, and hence the nature of its impact under different market conditions needs to be analyzed under HFT. The study attempts to estimate asymmetric information cost in HFT and analyze its determinants under different industry sectors and market conditions. The study followed Affleck-Graves et al. (1994, The Journal of Finance, 49(4), 1471–1488) model to estimate the asymmetric information cost using 5 minutes interval data for a period of 82 trading days. Information gets reflected in equity through the movement in price, variation in trading volume, and return volatility. The study has found share price, traded volume, return volatility and trading frequency as the major determinants of asymmetric information cost in different market conditions.

Methods On November 18, 2020, the official website of Judgmental Documents of China was searched for judgmental documents about the crime of illegal organization of blood trade from 2013 to 2019 in Beijing with the keywords ""Beijing"" and ""crime of blood trade by illegal organizations"". The case data involved in the judgmental documents, including the criminal’s personal information, judgment results, time and location of the crime, etc., were classified and summarized. Results A total of 58 judgmental documents were retrieved about the crime of illegally organizing blood trade, involving 58 cases, 115 criminals, 638 people, and 13 600 mL of illegally traded blood. Among the 115 criminals, 99 were male (86. 1%) and 16 were female (13. 9%); the ages were 18 to 61 years old (with an average age of 33 years). Ten were sentenced to detention, suspended sentence and fined; 8 were sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment, suspended sentence and fined; 97 were sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment and fined. From 2013 to 2019, the frequency of blood-trading crime by illegal organizations in Beijing showed a trend of fluctuating and declining. Among them, there was a big rebound in 2015, with the highest frequency of cases (34.5%, 20/58), and the lowest frequency was in 2018 (0). Based on the statistics on the month in which the crime of blood trade happened, it was found that the frequency of cases was the highest (32. 8%, 19/58) in January, followed by June (15. 5%, 9/58) and there were no illegal blood trade in April and May. The 58 cases of illegal blood trade involved 8 urban areas in Beijing, of which Haidian District accounted for the highest proportion (62. 1%, 36/58), followed by Fangshan District (22. 4%, 13/58). About 55. 2% (32/58) of the cases took place in hospitals, and 44. 8% (26/58) in blood centers (including blood collection stations). Conclusions From 2013 to 2019, the crime of blood trade by illegal organizations in Beijing showed a general downward trend. Summarizing the characteristics of the crime of blood trade by illegal organizations is helpful for accurate prevention of crime. © 2022, Peking Union Medical College Hospital. All rights reserved."

This allows some investors to gain information faster and earlier than others by means of their technology advantage. Such application may help to accelerate assets′ price discovery process, but it also aggravates information asymmetry and adverse selection risk, which may in turn harm market liquidity. Many existing static models discuss the impact of information asymmetry on market efficiency, but these models have yet to consider the dynamic process of investors′ information acquisition. A few scholars have built dynamic models in which some investors acquire information earlier than others, aiming to analyze herding behavior and the momentum effect. In these models, the equilibrium price is set by competitive risk-neutral market makers, which, however, leads to the impossibility of analyzing the game process between early-and late-informed traders in the first-period. In addition, their models fail to analyze the effects of time differences in information acquisition on market liquidity. Considering all these factors, we have developed a rational expectations equilibrium model where all rational traders are risk adverse to examine the effects of the sequential of information arrival on investors′ trading behavior and the consequent market liquidity, as well as exploring the impact of information acquisition cost on market liquidity. The research methods and main findings are as follows: First, we present a rational expectations model in two-period financial market where information is obtained by differently informed traders at different times. In our model, the risky asset composed of two independent fundamentals is traded by early-informed traders, late-informed traders and noise traders. The early-informed traders receive the perfect information about one fundamental before firstperiod trading takes place, and the late-informed traders do not receive such information until second-period market opens. A piece of imperfect information about another fundamental is obtained by both types of traders when the second-period market opens. Using properties of normal distribution, we solve the model and get the optimal strategy of rational traders and market clearing price of the traded asset in equilibrium. The equilibrium results show that a decrease in the risk of second-period price increases the trading intensity of early-informed traders and impacts on the later-informed traders in two ways: (1) reducing their inventory risk; (2) increasing the adverse selection risk they must face. The interplay of these two impacts causes the trading intensity of early and lateinformed traders to display a U-shaped pattern. In addition, the trading intensity of early-informed traders is independent of their proportion, whereas the trading intensity of late-informed traders has a negative correlation to the proportion of early-informed traders. Second, based on our model, we analyze the impact of time differences in information acquisition on market liquidity, which is measured by the amount of order flow that drives the price up by one unit. We find that the proportion of early-informed traders and the second-period price risk work on market liquidity by influencing trading intensity of informed traders. By means of numerical simulations and theoretical analysis, we find that the relationship between market liquidity and the proportion of early-informed traders is U-shaped under certain conditions. In a market characterized by high precision of the first-period noise trading or low second-period price risk, late-informed traders are more likely to trade against early-informed traders, which means that the adverse selection problem gets more severe. As a result, market liquidity decreases before increasing with the rising proportion of early-informed traders. When the proportion of early-informed traders is significant enough, any further increase will always promote market liquidity, improve price informativeness, and reduce the expected loss of noise traders. Third, information market equilibrium is defined and solved by introducing information costs in our model. Based on the definition of information market equilibrium, we present the necessary conditions for existence of an interior equilibrium and two corner equilibria, followed by an analysis of the impacts of information cost on the proportion of informed traders and market liquidity in the first-period in each equilibrium. In interior equilibrium, the cost of information acquisition negatively determines the proportion of early-informed traders and therefore reveals a U-shaped pattern in its relationship with market liquidity under some circumstances. In this paper, we discuss the potential impacts of information technology development on market liquidity. If most investors use information technologies to acquire and process information earlier and faster ( such as using WeChat or Microblog to acquire information disclosed by listed companies), market efficiency can be significantly enhanced. Meanwhile, when technical barriers exist in some new technologies such as high-frequency trading and financial big data analysis, a few traders can capitalize on this to acquire information before others, which puts late-informed traders at very high adverse selection risk in market making and thus harms market liquidity. According to our research conclusion, by increasing the proportion of institutional investors, reducing information acquisition cost or improving information disclosure efficiency, regulators may take actions to reduce the harm of information technology on market liquidity, especially in markets with high technical barriers © 2022.

Particularly high-frequency trading is suspected to have a negative effect in this respect. Recently we observed eroding profits from high-frequency trading and a declining market share.

Our approach is model agnostic because we do not specify the dynamics of the market.

The relationship is also confirmed during stock market crashes. We show that the invariance principle explains a significant fraction of the endogenous variation between market activity variables at the intraday and daily levels. Moreover, our tests strongly reject the mixture of distributions hypotheses that assume linear relationships between log-return variance and transaction intensity variables such as trading volume or the number of transactions. We demonstrate that the increase in the ruble risk transferred by one bet per unit of business time was accompanied by the rise in the average spread cost. Different aggregation schemes are used to mitigate the impact of errors-in-variables effects. Following the predictions of the Information Flow Invariance hypothesis, we also study the relationship between trading activity and the information process approximated by either the flows of news articles or Google relative search volumes of Russian stocks over the 2018–2021 period. The evidence suggests that a sharp increase in the number of retail investors who entered the Moscow Exchange in 2020 entailed a higher synchronization between trading activity and search queries in Google since February 2020, in contrast to the arrival rates of news articles.

An HbFPUPS is composed of a low-frequency-high-power uninterruptible power supply (LFUPS) and a high-frequency-low-power uninterruptable power supply (HFUPS) connected in parallel. LFUPS tracks the major load currents with lower frequency (LF) insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) while HFUPS regulates the output voltage and compensates the current ripples of LFUPS with higher frequency (HF) SiC MOSFETs. For multifrequency parallel inverters, ripple compensation control reduces LF ripples and mitigates multifrequency ripple issue in filter design when interleaved switching is not available. Compare with conventional single and parallel inverters with identical frequency and power, HbFPUPS provides a sufficient dynamic response without overdesigning the system with high-power-high-frequency costly SiC MOSFETs, or trading off efficiency for higher switching frequency operation on IGBTs. The remaining HF ripple and increased dynamic response reduce filter inductance and capacitance. In this article, control, parameter design, voltage regulation performance, and stability of HbFPUPS are analyzed.

However, their performance is not widely studied for cryptocurrencies, which are usually discerned as inefficient and unpredictable. One significant advantage of pairs trading is that potential profits can be generated regardless of the overall market movement. The pairs trading has the potential to be profitable for cryptocurrencies in bear markets and with intraday data. Kalman filter (KF) algorithms are popular for pairs trading to update the hedge ratio dynamically. They reduce the arbitrariness in parameter optimization by putting constraints on the parameter space. However, a major drawback is that the innovation volatility estimate calculated by using a KF algorithm is always affected by the initial values and outliers. An effective resilient filtering approach to estimate the innovation volatility is presented in this paper for cryptocurrencies. This paper presents rolling regression pairs trading strategies, traditional KF pairs trading strategies and resilient filter pairs trading strategies. The proposed trading strategies have been evaluated through some experiments on hourly Bitcoin USD and Ethereum USD prices and it is shown that the proposed resilient filter trading strategy is much more stable to initial values than the traditional KF trading strategy. © 2022 IEEE."

In the literature, however, it is rarely incorporated into price models. We consider that there are several types of agents trading only in specific multiples of the tick size resulting in an increased occurrence of these multiples in prices. For example, stocks on the NYSE and NASDAQ exchanges are traded with precision to one cent but multiples of five cents and ten cents occur much more often in prices. To capture this behavior, we propose a discrete price model based on a mixture of double Poisson distributions with dynamic volatility and dynamic proportions of agent types. The model is estimated by the maximum likelihood method. In an empirical study of DJIA stocks, we find that higher instantaneous volatility leads to weaker price clustering at the ultra-high frequency.

It explores the uneven nature of the recovery and volatility in the Treasury during these years. The second section sets forth regulatory responses to the Financial Crisis of 2008, including the massive fines imposed on large banks by a swarm of regulators. It examines the “too big to jail” prosecution model, cases involving Libor and foreign exchange manipulation and the impact of rogue traders. It also looks at the developments in payment systems, rise of crowdfunding as a source of capital, and high-frequency trading. The third section describes the rules adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 that broadly affected financial markets. It also recounts the Trump trade wars and ends with an account of the financial and economic turmoil that occurred during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. The volume will be an essential addition to academic and public libraries with readers drawn from business schools, departments of economics and finance, and historians. © 2022 Jerry W. Markham."

However, there is still limited information about the plant species and their derivatives traded outside larger markets in major cities. This study aimed to take inventory of the plant species traded for medicinal purposes in a traditional market outside a major city and determine their applications through vendors’ familiarization. Methods: An inventory of plant species traded for medicinal purposes in the Ho Central Market was undertaken, coupled with a semi-structured interviews on their applications based on the vendor's familiarization. Quantitative ethnobotanical indices were used to determine the most culturally important species. Results: A total of 60 plant species from 37 families was documented to be traded in the Ho Central Market. The Adansonia digitata, Thaumatococcus daniellii and Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides were recorded to have the highest frequency of citations. The highest use report (UR) and cultural importance (CI) values were recorded for Z. zanthoxyloides. Body pains, blood tonic (anemia), and abdominal pains were the most prominent conditions that traded plants were used to treat. Conclusion: The study revealed a total of 60 medicinal plants which is commonly sold in the Ho Central Market and other major markets in the country, which was attributed to idiosyncrasy in cultural knowledge about the application of the plants. The market served as a venue for information exchange and learning, resulting in the high uniformity of vendors' familiarization with plant application and that of traditional medicine practitioners. © 2022, Ilia State University, Institute of Botany, Department of Ethnobotany.

The prediction of stock prices is traditionally done with regression and classification, thereby requiring a large set of batch-oriented and independent training samples. This is problematic considering the nonstationary nature of a financial time series. In this research, we propose an online kernel adaptive filtering-based approach for stock price prediction to overcome this challenge. To examine a stock's performance and demonstrate the work's superiority, we use ten different KAF family of algorithms. In this paper, we take on this challenge and propose an approach for predicting stock prices. To analyze a stock's performance and demonstrate the work's superiority, we use ten distinct KAF algorithms. Besides, the results are analyzed on nine-time windows such as one day, sixty minutes, thirty minutes, twenty five minutes, twenty minutes, fifteen minutes, ten minutes, five minutes, and one minute. We are the first to experiment with several time windows for all fifty stocks on the Indian National Stock Exchange, to the best of our knowledge. It should be noted here that the experiments are performed on stocks making up the main index: Nifty-50. In terms of performance and compared to existing methods, we have a 66% probability of correctly predicting a stock's next upward or downward movement. This number clearly shows the edge that the proposed method has in actual deployment. Furthermore, the experimental findings show that KAF is not only a better option for predicting stock prices but that it may also be used as an alternative in high-frequency trading due to its low latency.  © 2022 Shambhavi Mishra et al."

We distinguish between slopes of lower and higher levels of the bid and ask sides and include them in a linear vector autoregressive system, along with the midquote return and trade direction, as in Hasbrouck (1991). The slopes of the higher levels have significantly greater (in terms of absolute value) immediate effects on prices than do the corresponding slopes of the lower levels. The immediate effects of the slope variable are reversed when we take the cumulative effects into consideration, suggesting that prices overreact to information embedded in the LOB. Furthermore, this reversal is stronger for the higher levels than for the lower levels, resulting in the cumulative effects of the higher levels being smaller than those of the lower levels. We link the asymmetries in the immediate effects of the lower and higher levels to the existence of more patient traders, in line with recent theoretical findings. Finally, we show that ignoring these asymmetries might have cost a high-frequency day trader 16 to 25 basis points in monthly profits. © 2021 Elsevier B.V."

Although numerous methods have been proposed for stock price prediction in literature, a good model with excellent performance is still a long way to go. In addition, earlier prediction methods were based on offline classification and regression, thereby requiring independent and large batch-oriented samples. We would emphasize on one point: a financial time-series data is non-stationary in nature. Hence, traditional regression and classification-based techniques are not ideal for predicting stock prices. In this paper, we propose an “online” kernel adaptive filtering (KAF)-based approach for stock price prediction. We experiment with ten KAF methods and analyze their predictive capability on nine different time windows such as: one day, sixty minutes, thirty minutes, twenty-five minutes, twenty minutes, fifteen minutes, ten minutes, five minutes, and one minute. The process is repeated for all 50 stocks of the National Stock Exchange’s main Index (NIFTY-50). The empirical results from the experiment show that KAF has several advantages over the current state-of-the-art. For instance, the probability that we can predict the next up or a down movement of a stock is 66%.

Accurate anomaly detection in the stock market can help investors evaluate and detect stock prices in different areas of various problems. In order to help stockholders to be more strategic and productive in stock capital, we are prose an algorithm that is both concise and effective. However, we found that a group of people make profits by manipulating the market to influence the stock price. This is just one of many factors that affect stock prices. However, based on previous studies, we find that many anomaly analyses are based on some existing dead rules, making it difficult to improve the accuracy of the process. Moreover, in the stock market, the outlier detection model is not suitable for dynamic high-latitude target detection, we must consider various factors of node variables. Therefore, in this paper, we firstly obtained high-frequency trading data and trained a model. The comparison between the algorithm we proposed, and the other three baselines' experimental results show that our proposed algorithm is more accurate than others, reducing the discriminant value of sequence fluctuation from 15% to 3%, and the screening result is closest to NYSE Rule 48, which has higher explanatory power and is more accurate.

It is shown that the information update technique at the heart of this model is impossible to compute in all but the simplest scenarios. Specifically, using tools from theoretical machine learning, the paper first demonstrates that there is no polynomial implementation of the model unless the independence structure of variables in the data is publicly known. Next, it is shown that there cannot exist a polynomial algorithm to infer the independence structure; consequently, the overall learning problem does not have a polynomial implementation. Using the learning model when it is computationally infeasible carries risks, and some of these are explored in the latter part of the paper in the context of financial markets. Especially in rich, high-frequency environments, it implies discarding a lot of useful information, and this can lead to paradoxical outcomes in interactive game-theoretic situations. This is illustrated in a trading example where market prices can never reflect an informed trader’s information, no matter how many rounds of trade. The paper provides new theoretical motivation for the use of bounded rationality models in the study of financial asset pricing—the bound on rationality arising from the computational hardness in learning. © 2021 by the author."

However, the daily closing price might not be the appropriate for price in some or all trading days. This is because the intraday data at various minute intervals, in our view, are likely to better reflect the information about the concrete behavior of the market returns and reactions of the market participants. Therefore, in this study, we propose using high-frequency data along with daily data in an attempt to determine hedging strategies, using five major international currencies against the American dollar. Specifically, in our study we used the 5-min, 30-min, 60-min, and daily closing prices of the USD/CAD (Canadian Dollar), USD/CNY (Chinese Yuan), USD/EUR (Euro), USD/GBP (British Pound), and USD/JPY (Japanese Yen) pairs over the 2018–2019 period. Using data at 5-min, 30-min, and 60-min intervals or high-frequency data, however, means the use of a relatively large number of observations for information extractions in general and econometric model estimations, making data processing and analysis a rather time-consuming and complicated task. To deal with such drawbacks, this study collected the high-frequency data in the form of a histogram and selected the representative daily price, which does not have to be the daily closing value. Then, these histogram-valued data are used for investigating the linear and nonlinear relationships and the volatility of the interested variables by various single-and two-regime bivariate GARCH models. Our results indicate that the Markov Switching Dynamic Copula-Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model performs the best with the lowest BIC and gives the highest overall value of hedging effectiveness (HE) compared with the other models considered in the present endeavor. Consequently, we can conclude that the foreign exchange market for both spot and futures trading has a nonlinear structure. Furthermore, based on the HE results, the best derivatives instrument is CAD using oneday frequency data, while GBP using 30-min frequency data is the best considering the highest hedge ratio. We note that the derivative with the highest hedging effectiveness might not be the one with the highest hedge ratio. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

In this way, consideration of uncertainty is important because it permits the scaling of investment size across trade opportunities in a principled and data-driven way. The authors showcase this insight with a prediction model and, based on a Sharpe ratio metric, find clear outperformance relative to trading strategies that either do not take uncertainty into account or use an alternative market-based statistic as a proxy for uncertainty. Of added novelty is their modeling of high-frequency data at the top level of the Eurodollar futures limit order book for each trading day of 2018, whereby they predict interest rate curve changes on small time horizons. The authors are motivated to study the market for these popularly traded interest rate derivatives because it is deep and liquid and contributes to the efficient functioning of global finance—though there is relatively little by way of its modeling contained in the academic literature. Hence, they verify the utility of prediction models and uncertainty estimates for trading applications in this complex and multidimensional asset price space. © 2020 With Intelligence Ltd."

The incorporation of information in submitted orders evidently affects prices, but it may also affect market quality for different reasons e.g., the use of low-quality information, or the fact that slower traders may be considering information that has already been incorporated in the market prices by faster traders, hence leading to the mispricing of the fair value.

Over time, network transmission speeds have developed rapidly without a corresponding increase in processing speeds of host processors. With devices featuring advanced connectivity and Internet functionality, protocol processing has created a heavy workload on the GPP and has become a limiting factor in high performance networking applications such as online High Frequency Trading Systems (HFTS). It encourages designers to increase processor performance or designing application specific processors for handling heavy network workloads. Then there is the choice of hardware/software implementations based on results from hardware acceleration. Offloading the whole network protocol stack implementation into hardware is not very attractive since handling large linked data structures inside the hardware is not as easy as in software. In this paper we claim that relieving the CPU from bulk processing by offloading selected, performance-related kernel code into hardware is a better option for such scenarios. Hence, we design a scalable system for offloading specific performance-related kernel functions into an FPGA.

To this, it should be noted here that this article is the first wherein a stock is analyzed by looking at these different time windows.

However, these data are of different types, usually consisting of constant attributes (scalar data), temporal dynamics at the individual level (functional data) and group summaries at the collective level (compositional data). Consequently, existing models are substantially challenged by difficulties encountered in data aggregation. Moreover, previous studies excessively focus on the predictive power rather than interpretative power of models, while the latter is genuinely more crucial for developing profound theories and disclosing in-depth mechanisms in social science. This paper proposes a novel model named mixed data multi-block partial least squares (MD-MBPLS) to overcome these difficulties. Four real-world datasets are considered to evaluate the model. These datasets arise from large-scale collections of smart-card sensors, high-frequency trading systems and online social media, representing trending topics of student campus behaviour, stock market volatility, fake news circulation and personality in tweeting. The empirical results congruously reveal the prominent advantages of the model with respect to data fusion and explanatory power. Specifically, interesting patterns are reliably revealed which supplement new insights and help decision makers to obtain guidelines for interventions, such as student academic performance enhancement or precautions against fake news propagation. Our model will enhance the interpretative ability of computational social science studies by fully leveraging mixed types of data. © 2021 Elsevier B.V."

The evolution of electronic trading has contributed to the growing prevalence of High-Frequency Trading (HFT) in recent years. Generally, HFT requires trading strategies to be fast in execution. However, the existing online portfolio selection strategies fail to either satisfy the demand for high execution speed or make effective utilization of historical data. In response, we propose a framework named Exponential Gradient with Momentum (EGM) which integrates EG with an acknowledged optimization method in stochastic learning, i.e., momentum. Specifically, momentum boosts the performance of EG by making full use of historical information. Most essentially, EGM can execute with only constant memory and running time in the number of assets per trading period, thus overcoming the drawback of most online strategies. The theoretical analysis reveals that EGM bounds the regret sublinearly. The extensive experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that EGM outperforms relevant strategies with respect to comprehensive evaluation metrics. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

We use a natural experiment provided by the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) for futures markets in 2012—the introduction of collocated facilities for FCM's. Previous research demonstrates that the change on the ASX in 2012 increased algorithmic trading and improved liquidity. We extend this study by documenting that the sensitivity of bid-ask spreads and market depth to price volatility and trading activity declines after the introduction of co-location. We also find that the speed of recovery of liquidity to large trades is more rapid after the introduction of colocated facilities. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that algorithmic trading reduces the time that limit orders are alive and the adjustment of quotes to new information and market volatility which in turn increases the resilience of liquidity. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC"

Algorithmic trading at high frequency is a form of automated trading in which machines, rather than humans, make the decision to buy or sell in spatiotemporal sequences. Insofar as they have agency of their own, their actions support the owners of the means of production. These techniques codevelop with new financial geographies. Accordingly, I examine technological change and speculative time-spaces of algorithmic strategies at stock exchanges. By analyzing algorithmic finance, I examine how—and to what extent—time, speed, location, and distance become critical for algorithmic finance by configuring time-spaces as competitive factors. The analysis interprets time-spaces of high-frequency trading strategies through the ways in which algorithmic finance constititutes what I term mobile market-informational epicenters. This article discusses the spatiotemporalities of market information and examines whether space-times of privately owned high-frequency trading infrastructures result in a juxtaposition between “public” and “private” market information across digital and physical space. It thereby responds to the questions of what role geography plays when algorithms make money in microseconds and how techno-financial time-spaces turn into competitive advantage. © 2021 The Author(s).

Cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile and unpredictable. Thus, cryptocurrency trading is challenging and involves higher risks than trading traditional financial assets such as stocks. To overcome the aforementioned problems, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach for cryptocurrency trading. The proposed trading system contains a self-attention network trained using an actor-critic DRL algorithm. Cryptocurrency markets contain hundreds of assets, allowing greater investment diversification, which can be accomplished if all the assets are analyzed against one another. Self-attention networks are suitable for dealing with the problem because the attention mechanism can process long sequences of data and focus on the most relevant parts of the inputs. Transaction fees are also considered in formulating the studied problem. Systems that perform trades in high frequencies cannot overlook this issue, since, after many trades, small fees can add up to significant expenses. To validate the proposed approach, a DRL environment is built using data from an important cryptocurrency market. We test our method against a state-of-the-art baseline in two different experiments. The experimental results show the proposed approach can obtain higher daily profits and has several advantages over existing methods. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

We test tail behaviour and how data-generating processes changed during the intraday trading period in both crisis and non-crisis periods. We also examine whether price asymmetry has a significant effect on the diffusion and jump characteristics of emerging market returns. The results identify a clear increase in jumps with infinite activity in crisis periods and a decreased identification of jumps with finite activity in non-crisis periods. In crisis periods, the proportion of large and small jumps increased and the proportion of Brownian motion decreased. We show that data-generating processes are not stable during the intraday trading period, which fluctuates slightly, particularly right after the market opening times in the morning and in the afternoon.

During the time liquidity, takers process information and send marketable limit orders (MLOs) to the exchange, the limit order book (LOB) might undergo updates, so there is no guarantee that MLOs are filled. We develop a latency-optimal trading strategy that improves the marksmanship of liquidity takers. The interaction between the LOB and MLOs is modeled as a marked point process. Each MLO specifies a price limit so the order can receive worse prices and quantities than those the liquidity taker targets if the updates in the LOB are against the interest of the trader. In our model, the liquidity taker balances the tradeoff between the costs of missing trades and the costs of walking the book. In particular, we show how to build cost-neutral strategies, that on average, trade price improvements for fewer misses. We employ techniques of variational analysis to obtain the price limit of each MLO the agent sends. The price limit of an MLO is characterized as the solution to a class of forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) driven by random measures. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the FBSDE and numerically solve it to illustrate the performance of the latency-optimal strategies.  © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company."

We denote the resulting estimator as realized quantile (RQ) and use it to forecast tail risk measures, such as Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES). The RQ estimator is built on the assumption that financial logarithm prices are subordinated self-similar processes in intrinsic time. The intrinsic time dimension stochastically transforms the clock time in order to capture the real “heartbeat” of financial markets in accordance with their trading activity and/or riskiness. The self-similarity assumption allows to compute daily quantiles by simply scaling up their intraday counterparts, while the subordination technique can easily accommodate numerous empirical features of financial returns, such as volatility persistence and fat-tailedness. Our method, which is built on a flexible assumption, is simple to implement and exploits the rich information content of high-frequency data from another time perspective than the classical clock time. In a comprehensive empirical exercise, we show that our forecasts of VaR and ES are more accurate than the ones from a large set of up-to-date comparative models, for both, stocks and foreign exchange rates. © 2021 The Author(s).

We analyze three different datasets for two highly studied market venues recorded in 2004 to 2006, 2010 to 2011, and 2018.

However, its volatility and brand new trading mode has made it challenging to devising an acceptable automatically-generating strategy. This study proposes a framework for automatic high-frequency bitcoin transactions based on a deep reinforcement learning algorithm — proximal policy optimization (PPO). The framework creatively regards the transaction process as actions, returns as awards and prices as states to align with the idea of reinforcement learning. It compares advanced machine learning-based models for static price predictions including support vector machine (SVM), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), long short-term memory (LSTM), temporal convolutional network (TCN), and Transformer by applying them to the real-time bitcoin price and the experimental results demonstrate that LSTM outperforms. Then an automatically-generating transaction strategy is constructed building on PPO with LSTM as the basis to construct the policy. Extensive empirical studies validate that the proposed method perform superiorly to various common trading strategy benchmarks for a single financial product. The approach is able to trade bitcoins in a simulated environment with synchronous data and obtains a 31.67% more return than that of the best benchmark, improving the benchmark by 12.75%. The proposed framework can earn excess returns through both the period of volatility and surge, which opens the door to research on building a single cryptocurrency trading strategy based on deep learning. Visualizations of trading the process show how the model handles high-frequency transactions to provide inspiration and demonstrate that it can be expanded to other financial products. © 2021 Elsevier B.V."

Method: We analyzed time series models such as ARMA and GARCH, gradient boosting tree model - which is a deep learning model - and machine learning models FFNN and GBM to compare each models' benefits and drawbacks. To determine the accuracy of each models' stock forecasting, we calculated the root mean square percentage error (RMSPE). The RMSPE reveals the magnitude of error in relation to the actual values; a lower value is wanted. Results & Conclusion: After evaluating the models against real market data, we found that the machine learning models outperformed the time series models. Machine learning models FFNN, and GBM have an RMSPE of roughly 0.20 and 0.21, respectively, while time series models Garch 1 and 2 had a RMSPE of 0.32 and 0.37, respectively. Therefore, feed-forward neural network and GBM forecast stock prices more accurately than LSTM and time series models. Unsupervised algorithms improve prediction accuracy.  © 2021 ACM."

All these make it more challenging to model appropriately the dynamics associated with high frequency data such as order arrival and price formation. To capture more accurately the microscopic structures and properties pertaining to the limit order books, this paper focuses on modeling high frequency data using Hawkes processes. Two models, one with exponential kernels and the other with power-law kernels, are introduced systematically, algorithmized precisely, and compared with each other extensively from various perspectives, including the goodness of fit to the original data and the computational time in searching for the maximum likelihood estimator, with search algorithm being taken into consideration as well. To measure the goodness of fit, a number of quantities are proposed. Studies based on both multiple-trading-day data of one stock and multiple-stock data on one trading day indicate that Hawkes processes with slowly-decaying kernels are able to reproduce the intensity of jumps in the price processes more accurately. The results suggest that Hawkes processes with power-law kernels and their implied long memory nature of self-excitation phenomena could, on the level of microstructure, serve as a realistic model for high frequency data. © Operational Research Society 2021."

It is practically desirable for investors, especially high-frequency traders, to consider cardinality constraints in portfolio selection, to avoid odd lots and excessive costs such as transaction fees. In this paper, a collaborative neurodynamic optimization approach is presented for cardinality-constrained portfolio selection. The expected return and investment risk in the Markowitz framework are scalarized as a weighted Chebyshev function and the cardinality constraints are equivalently represented using introduced binary variables as an upper bound. Then cardinality-constrained portfolio selection is formulated as a mixed-integer optimization problem and solved by means of collaborative neurodynamic optimization with multiple recurrent neural networks repeatedly repositioned using a particle swarm optimization rule. The distribution of resulting Pareto-optimal solutions is also iteratively perfected by optimizing the weights in the scalarized objective functions based on particle swarm optimization. Experimental results with stock data from four major world markets are discussed to substantiate the superior performance of the collaborative neurodynamic approach to several exact and metaheuristic methods. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

The research generated an updated database of fabricators, identified relevant challenges and prospects, and established a relationship between the education level of respondents and the types of food processing equipment fabricated. A total of 101 fabricators answered the structured questionnaire. Majority of respondents (81%) were married. 41% had junior high school and 20% senior high school education. Farming (31%) and trading (23.8%) provided the highest secondary sources of income to fabricators. 953 dependents were found to be direct beneficiaries of income generated from fabrication works. 33 food processing equipment were recorded with the fufu extruder and cassava grater obtaining the highest frequencies. 33.9% of respondents had not registered their businesses with the Registrar General's Department. Cross reference analysis depicted that education level of fabricators influenced the types of equipment fabricated; most especially in the fabrication of palm fruit boilers.

Further, we find that HFT activity is higher during periods of low efficiency. This supports the argument that HFTs seek profits and risk reduction by actively processing information, through limit order additions and cancellations, during periods of lower efficiency and revert to more passive market-making and rebate-generation during periods of higher efficiency. These findings support the argument that the adaptive market hypothesis (AMH) is an appropriate description of how prices evolve to incorporate information. © 2021 Meng, Li.

To do this, we utilize a precise timestamp of each tweet together with high-frequency financial data. We start by analyzing the impact of tweets in general, irrespective of their content. We find that tweets by President Trump are followed by increased uncertainty, increased trading and a decline in the US stock market. We utilize two methods in order to study whether the market reaction depends on the content of the tweets. First, classification of Trump's tweets depending on whether they contain a specific word reveals that market response is particularly negative for tweets containing the words “products” and “tariff”. Second, we use Latent Dirichlet Allocation to affiliate tweets with distinct topics. We find that while most topics do not impact financial markets, the US stock market responds to tweets related to the topic of a “trade war” by price decline, increased trading volume and increased uncertainty. The “trade war” tweets affect other financial markets too, as the Chinese stock market responds to these tweets negatively, while the price of gold responds positively.

We overcome this by designing a framework to detect mispricing, test informational efficiency and evaluate the behavioural biases within high-frequency prediction markets. We demonstrate this using betting exchange data for association football, exploiting the moment when the first goal is scored in a match as major news that breaks cleanly. There are pre-match and in-play mispricing and inefficiency in these markets, explained by reverse favourite-longshot bias (favourite bias). The mispricing tends to increase when the major news is a surprise, such as a goal scored by a longshot team late in a match, with the market underestimating their chances of going on to win These results suggest that, even in prediction markets with large crowds of participants trading state-contingent claims, significant informational inefficiency and behavioural biases can be reflected in prices. © 2021 International Institute of Forecasters"

Machine-aided and AI assisted technologies are currently involved in the so-called high frequency trading (HFT). The HFT systems are used to compute unconditional stylised facts of price returns to investigate co-movements within and across the market and to apply trading rules for buying and selling before the next set of price returns are due - now increasingly in the next micro or pico seconds. Unconditional statistics cannot be applied to markets with variance breaks, so it is equally important to calculate conditional stylised facts, especially a measure of variance that can be related to volatility; such iterative calculations can overload both data and compute resources but are essential for trading. A key contributor to market volatility is the impact of the so-called market sentiment expressed by the market stakeholders - this slow speed signal has to be integrated with much faster moving price returns and this will impose a new set of constraints on data and compute resources. In this paper we focus on the latency in the computation of (a) unconditional and conditional stylised facts and the impact on trading decisions; (b) the latency which is inherent in aggregating high speed signals (price movement at intra-day/hour level) and the discrete but arbitrarily timed sentiment. We describe the use of cloud-computing services to alleviate problems of latency in (a) and (b) and compare the results with that of local desktop solutions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

This study demonstrates how to optimize portfolios, asset allocation, and trading systems based on deep reinforcement learning using three frameworks. In the proposed deep learning structure, the input data are first decomposed through wavelet transformation (WT) to remove noise from stock price time-series data. Then, only the mother wavelet (high-frequency) data are used as input. Second, reinforcement learning is performed using the high-frequency data. The reinforcement learning network employs long short-term memory (LSTM). Actions are determined by the LSTM network or randomly. Third, it learns the optimal investment trading system using the actions of a given transaction and appropriate rewards. The structure of the optimal investment trading system obtained by the proposed deep reinforcement learning structure improves trading performance without requiring the construction of a predictive model. To investigate the performance of the proposed structure, we applied the S&P500, DJI, and KOSPI200 indices to the proposed structure (HW_LSTM_RL) and other reinforcement learning structures for comparison. We evaluated the difference in Sharpe ratio for various test periods (one to three years) and for different rewards. Using the decomposed high-frequency data as input, a portfolio of investment transactions was improved for highly volatile markets. In deep reinforcement learning, we found that network composition and appropriate rewards have significant influence on learning transactions in financial time-series data. Thus, the proposed HW_LSTM_RL structure demonstrates the importance of input data composition, learning network settings, and rewards. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature."

Researchers set up market mechanisms and behaviour rules for participating traders, modelled as agents, and observe the simulation results. However, these results can qualitatively change if trader incentives are ignored - an equilibrium analysis is key to ABM. Empirical game-theoretic analysis (EGTA) is widely adopted to compute the equilibria of these agent-based markets. In this paper, we investigate the equilibrium strategy profiles, including their induced market performance, and their robustness to different simulation parameters. For two mainstream trading mechanisms, continuous double auctions and call markets, we find that EGTA is needed for solving the game as pure strategies are not a good approximation of the equilibrium. Moreover, EGTA gives generally sound and robust solutions regarding different market and model setups, with the notable exception of agents' risk attitude. We also consider heterogeneous EGTA, a more realistic generalisation of EGTA whereby traders can modify their strategies during the simulation, and show that fixed strategies lead to sufficiently good analyses, especially taking the computation cost into the consideration.  © 2021 ACM."

Time-varying patterns of information share are identified across the period surrounding negative WTI prices. In particular, price discovery effects steadily abate after a sharp shock during the eight weeks before the negative pricing event. Peak price discovery differentials then re-occur within the negative-pricing event, before once again abating. Such results verify CFTC concerns surrounding the peculiarity of WTI futures trading conditions, that is, the conditions for the negative pricing event were well-established in the weeks before April 2020.

The extent of mean and volatility spillover prevalence varies across different scales. Hence, homogenous trading strategies for short-term and long-term investors may not be favorable. The finding further reveals that the risk transmissions are notable over the short run. In the context of cross spillover, there is greater evidence of exchange rate volatility impact on sectoral returns, whereas, few sectoral returns are found to affect exchange rate.

However, the existing trading models have many drawbacks. For example, the uniform pricing of network fees is difficult to fairly deal with the impact of different transactions on grid operation costs, and the centralized transaction form is difficult to process a large number of distributed transactions efficiently and economically. Therefore, it is especially important to establish a reasonable trading model. Therefore, this paper discusses the peer-to-peer transaction mode of multiple electricity sellers with the dynamic network fee mechanism. Considering the small-volume and high-frequency characteristics of peer-to-peer transactions, the min-max problem of dynamic network fees based on sensitivity coefficients is established and solved. Using the matching mechanism of continuous double auctions and considering the general-customized service provided by electricity sellers, the multi-round transaction mechanism of two continuous double auctions with dynamic network fees is proposed. In multi-round transactions, a real-time rolling network verification method is proposed for each round of transactions.

To capture fluctuations from external information and volatility of realized volatility (RV), we incorporate the trading volume and jumping into the HAR-V-J model in the first place and then incorporate a GARCH specification into the HAR-GARCH model. Results showed that there were large fluctuations in SHFE gold futures market before the launch of night trading sessions and mostly stemmed from overnight fluctuation in the international gold futures market. After the launch of night trading sessions, the realized volatility has a clear trend of moderation. In the in-sample estimation, both jump and external information are found to have significant explanatory power with the HAR-V-J model. Additionally, the volatility clustering and high persistence of the realized volatility were confirmed by the GARCH coefficients. Last but not the least, night trading sessions have significantly improved the out-of-sample forecasting performances of realized volatility models. Among them, the HAR-V-J model is the best-performing model. This conclusion holds for various prediction horizons and has great practical values for investors and policymakers. © 2020 The Authors.

All these applications require the detection to find all sequential anomalies possibly fast on potentially very large time series. In other words, the detection needs to be effective, efficient and scalable w.r.t. the input size. Series2Graph is an effective solution based on graph embeddings that are robust against re-occurring anomalies and can discover sequential anomalies of arbitrary length and works without training data. Yet, Series2Graph is no t scalable due to its single-threaded approach; it cannot, in particular, process arbitrarily large sequences due to the memory constraints of a single machine. In this paper, we propose our distributed anomaly detection system, short DADS, which is an efficient and scalable adaptation of Series2Graph. Based on the actor programming model, DADS distributes the input time sequence, intermediate state and the computation to all processors of a cluster in a way that minimizes communication costs and synchronization barriers. Our evaluation shows that DADS is orders of magnitude faster than S2G, scales almost linearly with the number of processors in the cluster and can process much larger input sequences due to its scale-out property. © 2021, The Author(s)."

For increasing the confidence in the integrity of audio files, the detection of fake-quality content is an important task. This paper proposes a method for detecting Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) compression on suspicious WAV files, in which the variance of the Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (MDCT) characterises four compression bitrates: uncompressed, 64 kbps, 128 kbps, and 256 kbps. This scheme takes advantage of the reduction of the variance of the high-frequency MDCT coefficients in compressed signals. Data obtained from MDCT coefficients generate a high-dimensional feature space. Hence, Principal Component Analysis, followed by Linear Discriminant Analysis, is used for projecting the high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional space. Besides, six supervised learning algorithms are compared for classifying four compression bitrates. The experiments show that using audio samples with 20 seconds and 1024 MDCT coefficients, an accuracy of 93% is reached with a Bayesian classifier. Collaterally, the detection between uncompressed and compressed signals attains an accuracy of 97% with Multinomial Logistic Regression. In conclusion, the proposed approach can detect previous AAC compression and can be potentially used when it is unfeasible to recover the suspicious signal completely. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Since the market events took place in electronic markets, and algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading, parts of FinTech, played significant roles, we handle the May 6 flash crash from the FinTech, SupTech, and financial supervision perspectives.

Different approaches have been used in the literature, the majority of which can be classified within the so-called econometric framework and sometimes also referred to as the macro-to-micro approach. Another strand of literature relies on the modelling of directly observable quantities, the so-called micro-to-macro approach. Based on this second line of research, we propose a new multivariate stochastic process to model simultaneously price returns, trading volumes and the time interval between changes in trades, price and volume. The proposed model is based on a generalization of semi-Markov chain models and copulas and is motivated by empirical evidence that the three mentioned variables are correlated and long-range autocorrelated. Utilizing Monte Carlo simulations, we compared our model with real data from the Italian stock market and show that it can reproduce many empirical pieces of evidence.

Had there been a predictor to accurately predict the final trading price of stocks, it could be an assurance to invest in the Stock Market. Thus we propose, a trustworthy hybrid model by cascading Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines(MARS) and Deep Neural Network(DNN), to predict closing prices of stock. The high-frequency KOSPI data set has been used and a customized pre-processing algorithm has been applied to clean the data. MARS is then been applied on this clean data and the attributes retained by MARS are passed to a DNN for training. Such application has resulted up to 92% closing price prediction accuracy. Thus, our hybrid model successfully has reduced the dimensional feature without compromising on accuracy as it gave better results than MARS and DNNs individually. Data-Augmentation has also been used to further verify the outcome of this application. Main metrics used for performance evaluation are Correlation(RHO) and R2 value. © 2021"

The empirical results based on the 5-minute high-frequency trading data of the Shanghai Composite Index indicate that signed range has a significant ""asymmetric"" impact on future volatility in the short term, with negative (positive) signed range leading to significantly higher (lower) future volatility. The out-of-sample prediction results show that the introduction of singed range can significantly improve the model's predictive ability, and the results are robust.

Using high-frequency 5-min data on 460 NASDAQ stocks from February to September 2017, we provide new evidence that sharp price movements during the day are also triggered by technical trading around special market configurations.

Whether there exists an anomaly caused by the tug of war between heterogeneous investors, similar to the US stock market, has become a common concern of both academic and industry. Based on the assumption of investor heterogeneity, this paper empirically examines whether the monthly intensity of the daily tug of war between individual investors and institutional investors can predict future stock returns. We decompose daily stock returns into an overnight component and a daytime component, and construct two measures of the intensity of this tug of war for a given stock by computing the abnormal frequency of daily reversals in a month that are characterized by either high or low opening prices, namely ""positive overnight returns followed by negative daytime reversals"" or ""negative overnight returns followed by positive daytime reversals"". We then examine whether either of these two measures contains predictive information about future stock returns. The main findings are as follows. There exists a significant anomaly of ""positive overnight returns followed by negative daytime reversals"" in the Chinese A-share market, for at least 6 months. In contrast, we find little evidence of such predictive relation when there is a high frequency of negative overnight returns followed by positive daytime reversals. It is more significant in the firms exhibiting smaller market capitalizations and higher PE ratios, in line with the characteristics of ""glamour stocks"". We find that investor sentiment, gambling preference and the limits of arbitrage are the main sources of the irrational mispricing in the above anomaly. Our analysis contributes to the research on the anomalies in the Chinese A-share market and provides new empirical evidence. Moreover, it has important practical significance in reducing the impact of anomalies, as well as improving market efficiency and regulatory effectiveness. © 2021, Editorial Board of Journal of Systems Engineering Society of China.

To estimate the empirical mutual information between time series of stock returns, we employ a novel kernel density estimator (KDE) based jackknife mutual information estimation (JMI), and compare it with the widely-used binning method. We then propose an average distance gradient change algorithm and an algorithm based on the average silhouette criterion that use pairwise and groupwise MI of high-frequency financial stock returns.

Alkylamide profiling of pericarps derived from Zanthoxylum armatum, Z. bungeanum, and some relative Zanthoxylum species from 72 plantations across China were tested using ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Then, several chemometrics were applied to classify the prickly ash pericarps to reveal potential indicators that distinguish prickly ash pericarps and to identify the key factors that affect pericarp alkylamide profiling. The dominating alkylamides in the prickly ash pericarps were Z. piperitum (ZP)-amide C (0–20.64 mg/g) and ZP-amide D (0–30.43 mg/g). Alkylamide profiling of prickly ash pericarps varied significantly across species and geographical variations. ZP-amide D in prickly ash pericarps was identified as a potential indicator to distinguish prickly ash species.

To achieve this objective, we measured a suite of physical, biotic and inorganic proxies of a lacustrine sequence. In general, between ~4130 to ~2640 cal yr BP proxy records reveal climate variability following a typical pattern of the northern hemispheric climate and appear to be dominated by westerlies. Thereafter, the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) forcing appears to dominate regional climate. The former period appears to have experienced human presence as evidenced by an invasive species of diatom –Didymosphenia and charcoal, likely originating from human activities on trading routes with Central Asia, China and Tibet. After ~2640 cal yr BP, when ISM started governing the climate of the Ladakh- Karakoram region, it probably induced high-frequency climate variability leading to disasters related to landslides, debris flows, avalanches etc., eventually reducing the intra-boundary trade. A similar situation appears to be gripping the region again as meteorologically recorded precipitation data from Ladakh reveals arrival of high-frequency monsoonal variability in the region with recurrent flash floods (e.g., 2010, 2013). © 2020 Elsevier B.V."

These include properties related to returns (leptokurtosis, absence of linear autocorrelation, volatility clustering), trading volumes (volume clustering, correlation between volume and volatility), and timing of trades (number of price changes, autocorrelation of durations between subsequent trades, heavy tails in their distribution, order-side clustering). Our model combines heterogeneous boundedly rational agents, endogenously activating on the basis of market events, with realistic assumptions on market microstructure. In particular, we introduce a strict event scheduling borrowed from the EURONEXT exchange. We study the model in a bottom-up fashion under alternative scenarios regarding the sophistication of agents’ strategies. These scenarios allow us to disentangle the role of microstructure characteristics from trading behaviour in the emergence of market statistical properties. Our results reveal that traders’ endogenous activation is crucial to jointly reproduce most of these properties. The ability of the model to replicate the main stylised facts of financial markets proves that it can be fruitfully used by policymakers as a test-bed for regulatory experiments aimed at improving market outcomes at different time-scales. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."

However, HFT trading marker prediction is a rarely investigated problem in Fintech literature. In this study, we first propose a novel manifold learning based HFT trading marker prediction model: M-SCAN to handle this challenge. Our study takes advantage of manifold embeddings of HFT data and seeks potential markers among the outliers in density-based clustering. We further propose HFT trading marker evaluation algorithms to validate the prediction effectiveness besides unveiling trading marker discovery via visualization. Our results demonstrate locally linear embedding (LLE) outperforms its peers in capturing trading markers in terms of accuracy and complexity for its local data structure keeping mechanism in embedding though different stocks may demonstrate their model preference under M-SCAN. Our studies also propose novel entropy and variance concentration ratios (VCR) to quantify HFT data and show that a high-entropy dataset is more likely to have better trading marker prediction than a low-entropy one. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first study in HFT trading marker prediction and will inspire coming studies in this area. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."

We calibrate and compare two multi-asset models with a systemic component: the model with co-jumps only and the model with both common and asset-specific jump components. We assume that jumps follow a compound Poisson process, and the jump sizes have a normal probability distribution. The Kullback–Leibler divergence and the Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests are used to compare the models and show that the model with common and asset-specific jumps provides a better fit to high-frequency data. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

The aggregate options order imbalance does not convey information after controlling for futures market trading.

However, there is no substantive ex-post oversight of the decisions made. During the specification of technical standards, we observe extensive hybrid accountability mechanisms between ESMA and industry stakeholders in which ESMA at times accommodates the interests of the latter. Procedural accountability mechanisms between national parliaments and supervisors are also extensively present during the implementation phase - i.e. market supervision - but they are not always used by politicians due to a lack of expertise and the high complexity of the subject. © The Editors and Contributors Jointly and Severally 2021."

Liquidity takers face a moving target problem as a consequence of their latency in the marketplace. They send market orders with a limit price that aim at a price and quantity they observed in the limit order book (LOB), and by the time their order is processed by the exchange, prices could have worsened, so the order may not be filled, or prices could have improved, so the order is filled at a better price. In this paper we provide a model to compute the price that liquidity takers would be willing to pay to reduce their latency in the marketplace. To this end, we derive a latency-optimal strategy that specifies the limit price of liquidity taking orders to increase the chances of filling orders if, due to latency, prices or quantities in the LOB have worsened. The latency-optimal strategy balances the trade-off between the costs of walking the LOB and targeting a desired percentage of filled orders over a period of time. We employ the cost of improving fills with the latency-optimal strategy to compute the shadow price of latency. Finally, we use a proprietary data set of foreign exchange (FX) to compute the maximum price that an FX trader would be willing to pay for colocation and hardware to reduce their latency in the marketplace. © 2021 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics Publications.

We quantify the probability of an adversarial trader being able to undertake the attack, based on the relative positioning of a transaction within a blockchain block. We find that a single adversarial trader can earn a daily revenue of over several thousand USD when performing sandwich attacks on one particular DEX - Uniswap, an exchange with over 5M USD daily trading volume by June 2020.

At a time when financial crime routinely crosses international boundaries, this book provides a novel understanding of its spread and criminalisation. It traces the international convergence of financial crime regulation with a uniquely comparative approach that examines key institutional and state actors including the European Union, the International Organization of Securities Commissions, as well as the United States, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, France, Italy and Germany, all countries that harbour some of the most influential stock exchanges in the Western world. The book describes and documents the phenomenon of internationalisation of securities frauds – such as insider trading and market manipulation – and the laws criminalising those acts, most notably those responding to recent dramatic transformations in securities markets, high frequency trading, and benchmark manipulation. At the European level, it shows the progressive uniformisation of laws culminating in the 2014 European Union Market Abuse Regulation. The book argues that criminal prohibitions against internationalised market abuse must be understood as an economic and legal imperative to protect financial markets against activities that imperil its integrity, compromising the confidence of investors and thus affecting the economy as a whole.

The analysis of literature has revealed the absence of the tested formalized methods and technological solutions that would allow for testing the algorithmic high-frequency trading (HFT) strategies in financial markets. The need for testing the HFT strategies is provided in the EU MiFID (Markets in Financial Instruments) II Directive, which aims to oblige the HFT trading operators to test all the trading algorithms and HFT strategies for possible errors. The authors of the paper attempt at creating and implementing the testing method for the automated high frequency statistical arbitrage trading, which would enable the analysis of a large amount of tick-by-tick data received from the electronic market in nanosecond time-stamp precision. The research task was to prepare a testing method for the automated HFT statistical arbitrage trading that would work with a large amount of high frequency data and offer the hardware prototype. The prototype demonstrates how the use of the graphics processing unit memory, code vectorization, parallel calculations and multidimensional arrays allow to analyze trading data on financial exchanges, to achieve the required calculation speed and therefore to make trading decisions faster than data transfer from electronic exchanges. © Vilnius University, 2002-2021."

Idiosyncratic volatility is increasing over time with some literature attributing this to the IT revolution. An understanding of the relationship between idiosyncratic risk and return is indeed relevant for idiosyncratic risk pricing and asset allocation, in a context of emerging technologies. The case of high-tech exchange traded funds (ETFs) is especially interesting, since ETFs introduce new noise to the market due to arbitrage activities and high frequency trading. This article examines the relevance of idiosyncratic risk in explaining the return of nine high-tech ETFs. The Markov regime-switching (MRS) methodology for heteroscedastic regimes has been applied. We found that high-tech ETF returns are negatively related to idiosyncratic risk during the high volatility regime and positively related to idiosyncratic risk during the low volatility regime. These results suggest that idiosyncratic volatility matters in high-tech ETF pricing, and that the effects are driven by volatility regimes, leading to changes across them. © 2021 by the authors.

The biggest difference between this paper and the existing literature is that this paper does not assume that the information shock is a white noise process but that the information shock comes from the news. This study does not use fiscal expenditure budget data and fiscal expenditure final data to estimate information friction but rather extends the standard Fève and Pietrunti (2016) theoretical framework to identify effective information and noise signals from market policy news by machine learning. A latent Dirichlet allocation model is employed to estimate the variance of effective information. China's carbon policy uncertainty as indicated by Chinese-language newspapers is used to estimate the variance of the noise signal. Therefore, we can calculate time-varying high-frequency information friction. The results of this study show that enterprises with different attributes in the same industry face different information friction. In China, state-owned industrial enterprises have the lowest levels of information friction. Joint-stock industrial enterprises have the highest levels of information friction. The higher the degree of policy information friction, the weaker the impact of effective information shocks and the greater the reduction in policy effects. These results have policy implications – the government should pay attention to enterprise attributes to reduce policy uncertainty and the degree of policy information friction, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of policy regulation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."

To identify the volatility and risk of the intraday market accurately and effectively, this paper proposes a method for intraday risk prediction based on generalized heterogeneity autoregressive for highfrequency spot volatility modeling. First, use the threshold kernel variation method to separate jumps and characterize the spot volatility, then redefine the heterogeneity characteristics of the high-frequency intraday market to construct the optimal generalized heterogeneity autoregressive model, and finally predict and assess the intraday market risk. The results show that the intraday jumps of the high-frequency crude oil futures mostly occur in the event window of geopolitical news and EIA announcements, and there are short-term jump aggregations. Separating the jumping components can establish a more accurate prediction model for the fluctuation process. The model proposed takes into account the characteristics of intraday heterogeneity and finds that weekly fluctuations have no information contribution to high-frequency traders. Compared with the ARMA and GARCH models, it ensures the validity and accuracy of the results. With easy operation and scalability, it is an effective risk management tool for crude oil intraday market transactions. © 2021 ICAE."

Due to the instantaneity and imperceptibility characteristics of intraday stock jumps, relevant studies on their predictability remain limited. This paper proposes a data-driven approach to predict intraday stock jumps using the information embedded in liquidity measures and technical indicators. Specifically, a trading day is divided into a series of 5-min intervals, and at the end of each interval, the candidate attributes defined by liquidity measures and technical indicators are input into machine learning algorithms to predict the arrival of a stock jump as well as its direction in the following 5-min interval. An empirical study is conducted using level-2 high-frequency data of 1271 stocks on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange of China to validate our approach. The results provide initial evidence of the predictability of jump arrivals and jump directions using level-2 stock data as well as the effectiveness of using a combination of liquidity measures and technical indicators for such prediction.

Due to attractiveness of Bitcoin in terms of returns and risk, Bitcoin price prediction is attracting a growing attention from both investors and researchers. Indeed, with the development of machine learning and especially deep learning, forecasting Bitcoin is receiving a particular interest. Methods: We implement and apply deep forward neural network (DFFNN) for the analysis and forecasting Bitcoin high-frequency price data. Importantly, we seek to investigate the effect of standard numerical training algorithms on the accuracy obtained by DFFNN; namely, the conjugate gradient with Powell-Beale restarts, the resilient algorithm, and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The DFFNN was applied to a big dataset composed of 65,535 samples. Results: In terms of root mean of squared errors (RMSEs), the simulation results show that the DFFNN trained with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm outperforms DFFNN trained with Powell-Beale restarts algorithm and DFFNN trained with resilient algorithm. In addition, the resilient algorithm is fast which suggests that it could be promising in online training and trading. Conclusions: The DFFNN trained with Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is effective and easy to implement for Bitcoin high-frequency price data forecasting. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature."

Frequency regulation ancillary service, which refers to the secondary frequency regulation reserve capacity of the generator, helps meet the system frequency stability requirements through the automatic generation control unit (AGC) automatic response area control error (ACE) [1]. Under the circumstance that the comprehensive performance index of frequency regulation of power generation units is not prominent enough, the power generation enterprises are faced with the complicated situation of high frequency of market transaction, fierce market competition, the cost of frequency regulation cannot be accurately calculated, and the trading strategy cannot be effectively evaluated. In the process of making trading strategy, they are faced with severe challenges. This article taking China Southern (starting from Guangdong Province) Regulation Ancillary Service Market as the background and a 600MW coal-fired unit as the research object, to propose a strategy analysis method which is based on trading interval decision-making model and opportunity cost analysis. It helps generation companies to optimize the combination of day-ahead trading periods under the strategy of revenue maximization through opportunity cost analysis and the actual operation of units, and effectively solves the problem that the unit frequency regulation cost cannot be accurately quantified. At the same time, through the establishment of the trading interval decision-making model, generating companies can accurately reduce the unit offer price range, significantly improve the generating unit transaction bid success rate, realize the scientific analysis and accurate decision of the regulation ancillary service market transaction, and effectively carry out the post-evaluation of the trading strategy, constantly optimize and improve the trading strategy. The effective application of the transaction decision-making method not only guarantees the generating unit to provide high quality regulation ancillary service for the safety and stable operation of the power system, but also maximizes the profit of the Regulation Market transaction of the generation company. It improve the management level of generation companies on Regulation Ancillary Service Market transaction, this strategy analysis method aims to improve the market competitiveness of generation company in Regulation Market, and provides theoretical analysis and practical exploration for the integration of the energy market and the Regulation Market in the future under the trading environment of electricity spot market in Yunnan Province, which can be used as a reference for the industry.  © 2021 IEEE."

Moreover, it is demonstrated that such capability operates better in nowcasting than h-step ahead forecasting, and remains prominent even after we account for commonly-used macroeconomic predictive factors.

To this end, we construct a set of features that encapsulate relevant microstructural information over short lookback windows. These features are subsequently leveraged, first to generate a leader–lagger network that quantifies how markets impact one another, and then to train linear models capable of explaining between 10% and 37% of total variation in 500 ms future returns (depending on which market is the prediction target). The results are then compared with those of various PnL calculations that take trading realities, such as transaction costs, into account. The PnL calculations are based on natural taker strategies (meaning they employ market orders) associated with each model. Our findings emphasize the role of a market's fee regime in determining both its propensity to lead or lag, and the profitability of our taker strategy. We further derive a natural maker strategy (using only passive limit orders) which, due to the difficulties associated with backtesting maker strategies, we test in a real-world live trading experiment, in which we turned over 1.5 M USD in notional volume.

Our findings indicate low inter-group connectedness, distinct group clustering, and high intragroup network-based connectedness in realized volatilities of sample commodities. We find more pronounced inter- and intra-group volatility connectedness for negative realized volatilities than positive ones. Besides, we show that volatility connectedness is a long-run phenomenon. Additionally, the time-varying net directional spillover connectedness reveals that the bad volatility connectedness dictates the good volatility connectedness for the total sample as well as for various frequency domains, both in terms of magnitude and length of time.

This contract aims at attracting liquidity on the platform. This is because the wealth of the exchange depends on the arrival of market orders, which is driven by the spread of market makers. We compute the optimal contract in quasi-explicit form and also derive the optimal spread policies for the market makers. Several new phenomena appears in this multi market-maker setting. In particular we show that it is not necessarily optimal to have a large number of market makers in the presence of a contracting scheme. © 2021 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics"

This article builds on original ethnographic research into a new class of algorithmic trading programs known as 'roboadvisors'-inexpensive, automated, digital financial platforms that enable ordinary people to invest very small minimum amounts and that rely to a large extent on passive, index strategies that follow the prescripts of Modern Portfolio Theory. The main argument of the article is that roboadvisors, representing an ethos of 'low-finance', are actively constructing passive investors by disciplining them through technologies that embody canonical models of financial economics. Roboadvisors and their algorithms reconfigure their users and objectify them through automating investment decisions and enforcing a principle of 'don't do' vis-à-vis the market.

This permits models of price dynamics at resolutions sufficient to capture the reactions of the fastest agents. Direct estimation of multivariate time series models at sub-millisecond frequencies nevertheless poses substantial challenges. To facilitate such analyses, this paper applies long distributed lag models, computations that take advantage of the inherent sparsity of price transitions, and bridged modeling. At resolutions ranging from 1 s down to 10 μs, I estimate representative models for two stocks (IBM and NVDA) bearing on three topics of current interest. The first analysis examines the extent to which the conventional source of market data (the consolidated tape) accurately reflects the prices observed by agents who subscribe (at additional cost) to direct exchange feeds. At a 1-s resolution, the information share of the direct feeds is indistinguishable from that of the consolidated tape. At resolutions of 100 and 10 μs, however, the direct feeds are totally dominant, and the consolidated share approaches zero. The second analysis examines the quotes from the primary listing exchange vs. the non-listing exchanges. Here, too, information shares that are essentially indeterminate at 1-s resolution become much more distinct at higher resolutions. Although listing exchanges execute about one-fifth of the trading volume, their information shares are slightly above one-half. The third analysis examines quotes, lit trades, and dark trades. At a 1-s resolution, dark trades appear to have a small, but discernible, information contribution. This vanishes at higher resolutions. Quotes and lit trades essentially account for all price discovery, with information shares of roughly 65% and 35%, respectively.  © 2019 The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press.

VMD eliminates the noise signals and stochastic volatility in the price data by decomposing the data into variational mode functions, while technical analysis uses statistical trends obtained from past trading activity and price changes to construct technical indicators. The support vector regression (SVR) accepts input from a hybrid of technical indicators (TI) and reconstructed variational mode functions (rVMF). The model is trained, validated, and tested in a period characterized by unprecedented economic turmoil due to the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing the evaluation of the model in the presence of the pandemic. The constructed hybrid model outperforms the single SVR model that uses only TI and rVMF as features. The ability to predict a minute intraday Bitcoin price has a huge propensity to reduce investors' exposure to risk and provides better assurances of annualized returns.  © 2021 Samuel Asante Gyamerah."

In this paper, we identify and characterize jump risks in the Canadian stock market using high-frequency data from the Toronto Stock Exchange. Our results provide a strong evidence of jump clustering–about 30% of jumps occur within first 30 minutes of trading hours, and about 25% of jumps are due to the overnight returns. While average intraday jump is negative, jumps induced by overnight returns bring a cancellation effect yielding average size of the jumps to zero. We show that the economic significance of jump component in volatility forecasting is significant but nominal. Our results further demonstrate that market jumps and overnight returns bring significant changes in systematic risk of stocks. From a cross-sectional perspective, while the average effect of market jumps on the beta is not significantly different from zero, the average effect of overnight returns is statistically significant. Overall, our results suggest that systematic risk induced by the market jumps could be hedged by combining value stocks and growth stocks in a portfolio whereas the systematic risk induced by overnight returns can not be hedged even with a well diversified portfolio. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

The proposed approach corresponds to an actual auction mechanism in which an electronic stock exchange terminal processes real-time data. The theoretical framework is based on the microeconomic model of an individual investor’s net demand. Equity resources and resources of “free” capital (exchanged for shares) owned by traders and the investors’ perception of the structure of the target portfolio are considered the initial variables of the model. The model differs from the classical theory of asset pricing in its notion of fundamental variables. The relations derived for the aggregated net demand in the stock market describe share pricing as a market exchange that results in the Walrasian equilibrium approximation. The authors offered an appropriate econometric technique for estimating the parameters of instantaneous aggregated net demand. The developed approach was tested using the Walrasian equilibrium concept, which demonstrated that the modeled share price corresponded with the observed share price for the Russian financial market. As an example, the authors presented the results of the investment strategy based on the developed approach for the Russian financial market during the 2008–2009 crash. The authors based their approach on identifying the expectations of the stock market participants through an analysis of high-frequency trading platform information. The microeconomic model describes the motives of traders for placing limit orders in the stock market and associates the price and volume of a particular limit order within the parameters of the capital capacity of the net demand of the trader. The application of the algorithm allows for the monitoring of the financial market situation and reveals the market expectations of traders based on the analysis of information transmitted by an order book of a trading platform © 2021,International Journal of Technology.All Rights Reserved"

Without trading costs, risk-adjusted profits are linear in the trading horizon and rise asymmetrically as the Hurst exponent departs from Brownian motion, remaining finite as the exponent reaches zero while diverging as it approaches one.

In this study, we apply carbon accounting methods, scaling hours to decades to 28-years of scientific CO2 eddy covariance data for the Harvard Forest (US-Ha1), located in central Massachusetts, USA and estab-lishing commercial carbon trading protocols and applications for similar sites. We illustrate and explain transactions of high-frequency direct measurement for CO2 net ecosystem exchange (NEE, gC m−2 year−1 ) that track and monetize ecosystem carbon dynamics in contrast to approaches that rely on forest mensuration and growth models. NEE, based on eddy covariance methodology, quantifies loss of CO2 by ecosystem respiration accounted for as an unavoidable debit to net carbon sequestration. Retrospective analysis of the US-Ha1 NEE times series including carbon pricing, interval analysis, and ton-year exit accounting and revenue scenarios inform entrepreneur, investor, and landowner forest carbon commercialization strategies. CO2 efflux accounts for ~45% of the US-Ha1 NEE, an error of ~466% if excluded; however, the decades-old coupled human and natural system remains a financially viable net carbon sink. We introduce isoflux NEE for t13 C16 O2 and t12 C18 O16 O to directly partition and quantify daytime ecosystem respiration and photosynthesis, creating new soil carbon commerce applications and derivative products in contrast to undifferenti-ated bulk soil carbon pool approaches.

This paper introduces a novel application of the Sequence Generative Adversarial Networks framework to model the order flow, such that random sequences of the order flow can then be generated to simulate the intra-day variation of prices. As a benchmark, a well-known parametric model from the quantitative finance literature is selected. The models are fitted, and then multiple random paths of the order flow sequences are sampled from each model. Model performances are then evaluated by using the generated sequences to simulate price variations, and we compare the empirical regularities between the price variations produced by the generated and real sequences.

It is stated that there is a spectrum between gambling and investment behaviour, and there are ‘‘speculative” investment tools in the middle of the spectrum. Considering that it presents a higher risk because of its high volatility compared to traditional investment instruments, trading cryptocurrencies can become pathological and gambling-like. This study aims to investigate the pathological trading behaviour and frequency among cryptocurrency investors, to investigate additional gambling disorders, and to investigate the relationship between cryptocurrency investment behaviour and impulsivity. An online questionnaire was created to investigate these issues. In the questionnaire, the Pathological Trading Scale, the South Oaks Gambling Screen Test and the Barratt Impulsivity Scale were all used. A total of three hundred persons were evaluated. We found that total pathological traders were 48.7% of all traders, impulsivity in 18-25 age group was higher, high- frequency traders were more pathological, and their impulsivity was higher; also margin traders and day traders show more pathological behaviour. It seems that an important part of cryptocurrency traders may be pathological, and certain of them may have cryptocurrency addiction, which can be evaluated as a subtype of gambling disorder. © 2021, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health.

It has caused a severe economic shock to both the Irish and global economy with shutdown measures implemented in most economies. This paper describes a high frequency database and model developed from both the econometric and medical literature to provide a relative measure of the path of the pandemic in Ireland and across the globe with the aim of adding to the real time evidence for policy makers. Model estimates are reported for the critical early and peak stages of the pandemic. The pandemic is modelled as a stochastic difference equation. The logistic form is chosen as it is found to be the most practical model with the flexibility to provide daily estimates for a large set of countries on a key aspect of the pandemic, the steepness of the curve. This characteristic of the pandemic, whereby a steep rise in cases results in “flatten the curve” policy responses, is most closely associated with a suppression of economic activity. As a small open economy, it is critical for policy makers in Ireland to track developments in external demand. It is a key variable that frames scenario analysis and forecasting for government budgeting. The high-frequency database and time series model developed in this paper provides a real time relative indicator of potential economic impacts from the global spread of COVID-19 by estimating well known properties of functions. In the early stages of the pandemic the model estimated a high value of steepness of the curve for Spain and Italy and a low level for Korea. Ireland’s measure showed a trend decline, in line with countries such as Denmark and Austria. As the situation improved in Ireland model estimates provided an early indication of a deteriorating situation in some of Irelands main trading partners indicating a more prolonged economic impact. Second wave estimates indicated lockdown measure would persist throughout 2020 in large European trading partners. © 2021, Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland. All rights reserved."

This can for example model a situation where the asset price is partially controlled by a company which intervenes when the price is reaching a certain lower barrier. See e.g. Jarrow and Protter (J Bank Finan 29:2803–2820, 2005) for an explanation and discussion of this model in the Brownian motion case. As already pointed out by Karatzas and Shreve (Methods of Mathematical Finance, Springer, Berlin, 1998) (in the continuous setting), this allows for arbitrages in the market. However, the situation in the case of jumps is not clear. Moreover, it is not clear what happens if there is a delay in the system. In this paper we consider a jump diffusion market model with a singular drift term modelled as the local time of a given process, and with a delay θ> 0 in the information flow available for the trader. We allow the stock price dynamics to depend on both a continuous process (Brownian motion) and a jump process (Poisson random measure). We believe that jumps and delays are essential in order to get more realistic financial market models. Using white noise calculus we compute explicitly the optimal consumption rate and portfolio in this case and we show that the maximal value is finite as long as θ> 0. This implies that there is no arbitrage in the market in that case. However, when θ goes to 0, the value goes to infinity. This is in agreement with the above result that is an arbitrage when there is no delay. Our model is also relevant for high frequency trading issues. This is because high frequency trading often leads to intensive trading taking place on close to infinitesimal lengths of time, which in the limit corresponds to trading on time sets of measure 0. This may in turn lead to a singular drift in the pricing dynamics. See e.g. Lachapelle et al. (Math Finan Econom 10(3):223–262, 2016) and the references therein. © 2020, The Author(s)."

Using statistical tests, we empirically confirm that a synchrony propensity appears in the market, where a buy order arrival tends to follow the sell order's long-term mean level and vice versa. This is presumably closely related to the drastic increase in the influence of high-frequency trading activities in markets. To solve the high-dimensional Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation, we propose a deep neural network approximation and theoretically verify the existence of a network structure that guarantees a sufficiently small loss function. Finally, we implement the terminal profit and loss profile of market-making using the estimated optimal strategy and compare its performance distribution with that of other feasible strategies.

It has wide applications in risk management, asset pricing, and asset allocation. In recent years, extreme volatilities occurred in the Chinese financial market from time to time. For example, during 2014-2015, the Chinese stock market underwent extreme market conditions: the stock market sharp rally was followed by a sharp plunged, which eventually evolved into a crash. In particular, the abnormal volatilities from June to August in 2015 caused investors and regulators to concern about financial risks. Existing volatility modeling methodologies are largely based on low-frequency data. The most widely used models include GARCH and stochastic volatility (SV) models. Although these models can capture the main characteristics of financial market volatility, they are subject to a few limitations. First, these models are parametric in spirit and thus may suffer from model misspecification. Second, these models only use low frequency returns to estimate and forecast volatility without considering intraday sample information. The estimates may be biased, leading to nontrivial forecast errors. Last, the parametric estimation procedure for these models remains very complicated, especially for the SV model. In the multivariate case, these models are constantly challenged by the curse of dimensionality, and therefore are of limited use in real applications. Recently, with easier access to high-frequency data and the rise of high frequency trading, an increasing number of studies begin to use high-frequency data to estimate, model and predict volatility. One of the most famous proxy variables for volatility is so-called realized volatility (RV). RV has several merits: it is nonparametric and thus requires less assumptions on model set-up. As a matter of fact, it only imposes the assumption of no arbitrage opportunities. Besides, RV is a direct proxy for volatility, it is not necessary to obtain the embedded volatility like the GARCH model. Last but not least, many studies find the forecasting performance of the simple time series model for RV can beat the GARCH model. However, there are several challenges when using high frequency data to estimate volatility. First, many studies show that jump should be included in asset prices. In the presence of jumps, RV is indeed an estimation of the sum of continuous volatility (CV) and jump volatility (JV). Since CV and JV represent different types of risk, it is necessary to disentangle them from each other in real applications. Two most famous estimations for CV are the multipower estimation and truncated realized variance estimation. Second, the observed high-frequency prices are usually contaminated by noise due to but not limited to bid-ask spread, information asymmetry, discreetness of price, etc. Under these scenarios, RV is no longer a consistent estimation of CV, and the size of bias determinates as the sampling frequency increases. There are several ways to alleviate the effects of noise when estimating CV. One common strategy is using the subsampling method, which, however, will lead to information loss. Other methodologies include the two-scale realized variance (TSRV) or multiscale realized variance (MSRV) estimation, the realized kernel estimation, the pre-averaging method, the quasi maximum likelihood estimation (QMLE), and the local moment estimation (LMM), etc. But most of them assume that noise process is independent of the underlying asset price and serially independent. For example, the TSRV (MSRV) and QMLE estimation assume that noise is i. i. d., while the pre-averaging method assumes that noise is conditionally independent. However, empirical studies reveal that noise is time varying, dependent and correlated with the underlying asset price. These stylized facts are much more complicated than the assumptions underlie the models. Therefore, it is important to improve the accuracy of volatility measurement, as well as to separate noise variance, CV and JV from noisy high frequency data. By doing so, we can improve the management of volatility and market risk surveillance. In view of these facts, this paper extends the pre-averaged threshold realized variance estimator for integrated volatility in Jing, et al[1] to the case with time-varying conditional variance of market microstructure noise and jumps. By using pre-averaging and threshold technique, we can remove the microstructure noise and jumps, respectively. The asymptotic properties of this new estimator, including the consistency and associated central limit theorems, are also provided. Monte Carlo simulations show that the estimator is robust to both microstructure noise and Levy jumps, and it provides less biased estimation, compared with existing estimators, of continuous variations in finite samples. We also illustrate, through Monte Carlo simulations, how the choice of threshold and preaveraging parameters, as well as noise with time-varying conditional variance (e. g. the moving average noise, rounding noise and dependent noise) affect the CV estimation. In the empirical analysis part, we use the improved pre-averaged threshold realized variance estimation on the Level-2 high frequency data for SSE 50 component stocks from 2014 to 2015. We separate noise variance, jump volatility and continuous volatility and study the relationships among these volatilities using panel vector autoregressive models. Then, we investigate the predictive power of noise variance on CV and JV using the extended HAR models. The main findings are summarized as follows. There exists bidirectional Granger causality between noise variance and CV. Both CV and noise variance Grangercause JV, but not vice versa. Noise variance has positive predictive power for underlying return volatility, and such predictability holds for both CV and JV, especially for the former. © 2021. All Rights Reserved."

This paper proposes an optimal limit order book analysis for five stocks, including Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), Intel (INTC), and Microsoft (MSFT). It is based on deep learning and an enhanced pigeon-inspired (PIO) algorithm. The system reduces the dimentaionlty of LOB data sets by using a pigeon-inspired optimizer to determine the most significant features. The fitness function is used to evaluate the fitness value of each solution based on TPR and FPR and the feature count. The optimized LOB feature selection is evaluated using the Decision Tree (DT) classifier. A new deep neural network with high-frequency order series includes convolutional, dense layers and Inception units to predict future stock price movements (Submission, Cancellation, Deletion, Execution visible and hidden orders) in an extensive high-frequency LOB database that supports improving the operational performance of the trading process. The proposed model is evaluated using the LOB dataset, and the results show that the model performs better in predicting the different classes. The analysis of variance ANOVA supports the obtained results that test for the significant difference among the means of all items according to their event types. © 2021, Success Culture Press.

Specifically, the previous night's return can significantly predict the day's return both in- and out-of-sample. Asset allocation and market timing exercises show that this finding is also economically significant.

Trading at the Speed of Light tells the story of this epic transformation. Donald MacKenzie shows how in the 1990s, in what were then the disreputable margins of the US financial system, a new approach to trading-automated high-frequency trading or HFT-began and then spread throughout the world. HFT has brought new efficiency to global trading, but has also created an unrelenting race for speed, leading to a systematic, subterranean battle among HFT algorithms. In HFT, time is measured in nanoseconds (billionths of a second), and in a nanosecond the fastest possible signal-light in a vacuum-can travel only thirty centimeters, or roughly a foot. That makes HFT exquisitely sensitive to the length and transmission capacity of the cables connecting computer servers to the exchanges’ systems and to the location of the microwave towers that carry signals between computer datacenters. Drawing from more than 300 interviews with high-frequency traders, the people who supply them with technological and communication capabilities, exchange staff, regulators, and many others, MacKenzie reveals the extraordinary efforts expended to speed up every aspect of trading. He looks at how in some markets big banks have fought off the challenge from HFT firms, and how exchanges sometimes engineer technical systems to favor certain types of algorithms over others. Focusing on the material, political, and economic characteristics of high-frequency trading, Trading at the Speed of Light offers a unique glimpse into its influence on global finance and where it could lead us in the future. © 2021 by Princeton University Press."

Two prominent binaural cues are the interaural level difference (ILD) and the interaural time difference (ITD). The ITD cue can further be subdivided into the ongoing envelope ITD cues and transient onset ITD cues. More is known about the sensitivity of single neurons to ongoing envelope ITDs compared to transient onset ITDs in the mammalian auditory system, particularly in bats. The current study examines the response properties of single neurons in the inferior colliculus (IC) of the big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, to onset ITDs in response to high frequency pure tones. Measures of neurons’ dynamic ITD response revealed an average change of 36% of its maximum response within the behaviorally relevant range of ITDs (±50 µs). Across all IC neurons, we measured an average time-intensity trading ratio of 30 µs/dB in the sensitivity of the ITD response function to changing ILDs. Minimum and maximum ITD responses were clustered within a narrow range of ITDs. The average peak in the ITD response function was at 268 µs, a finding that is consistent with other non-echolocating mammals. Some ITD-sensitive neurons also showed weak facilitation of maximum response during binaural stimulation, compared to monaural stimulation. These results suggest that echolocating bats possess the potential to use onset ITD cues to assist in the azimuthal sound localization of ultrasonic frequencies. © 2020"

Three statistical methods: Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD), and Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN), are implemented to decompose the stock index sequence and obtain several intrinsic mode function (IMF) components.

As a result, there is interest in using HF for high-frequency trading (HFT), to make trans-continental market decisions that leverage the lower latency path of HF channels. The HF skywave channel is a dynamic medium and is one of the most challenging communication channels. Latencies in existing HF modems from coding and interleaving over several packets are prohibitive for HFT, which motivates the development of receivers that provide good performance given a delay constraint. In this paper, we present receiver designs that can be employed for low-latency reliable communication. We introduce a multitrellis adaptive Viterbi algorithm (MAVA) for sparse and time-varying intersymbol interference (ISI) channels, where the conventional Viterbi algorithm would lead to a large trellis. While multitrellis receiver designs have previously been considered, MAVA also incorporates real-time channel tracking, which is necessary for a practical HF receiver. We combine the MAVA algorithm with maximum a posteriori (MAP) detection to obtain a hybrid receiver with high-fidelity, low-delay performance. Finally, we conduct an asymptotic efficiency analysis of the hybrid receiver to gain insight into how deferring decisions improves performance in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime.  © 2002-2012 IEEE."

Specifically, HFTs' aggressive purchases and sales lead those of other investors, and this effect is stronger at times when it is more difficult for non-HFTs to disguise their order flow. Consistent with some HFTs being more skilled or more focused on anticipatory strategies, I show that trades from a subset of HFTs consistently predict non-HFT order flow the best.

Combining the anthropological literature on traps and trapping, Simmel’s work on competitive relationships, film criticism, and a rereading of management consulting logic, we develop a theory of prizes as organizers and enforcers of competitive relationships. We argue that contests are traps, funnelling both the wary and unsuspecting into competitive relationships through the lure of material and symbolic rewards. Empirically, our argument proceeds through paired case studies. The first case examines how a straightforward (if technically daunting) educational project designed to teach newcomers the basics of laboratory techniques is transformed into a competitive project when a potential prize is introduced. The second case examines how people spontaneously organize and compete with each other around the promise of an amorphous and fictitious prize during the development of high-speed trading. © the several contributors 2021."

We apply the social force model built on pedestrian movement patterns to examine micro characteristics of the Chinese stock market.

In addition, we find that stock trading patterns with unbalanced buyers and sellers correspond to pedestrian counterflows with unbalanced flows from one side of the door to the other. Our results also show that stock trading patterns under various trading volumes are similar to pedestrian counterflows with different flow rates. In general, our results indicate that stock trading patterns are influenced by investor behaviors and conflicting interests similar to those present in the social force model of pedestrian counterflows.

According to the duplex theory of sound lateralization, ITD and ILD play a more significant role in low-frequency and high-frequency stimulations, respectively. In this study, ITD and ILD, which were extracted from a generic head-related transfer functions, were imposed on a complex sound consisting of two low- and seven high-frequency tones. Two-alternative forced-choice behavioral tests were employed to assess the accuracy in identifying a change in lateralization. Based on a diversity combination model and using the error rate data obtained from the tests, the weights of the ITD and ILD cues in their integration were determined by incorporating a bias observed for inward shifts. The weights of the two cues were found to change with the azimuth of the sound source.

In this study–using price changes from the EUR/USD currency pair traded on the Electronic Broking Services (EBS) interbank trading platform and the S&P 500 E-mini futures contract traded at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)–it is shown that the estimated branching ratio depends little upon window size and is usually far from criticality. This is done by controlling for exogenous non-stationarities/heterogeneities at inter- and intraday scales, accomplished by using information criteria to select the degree of flexibility of the Hawkes immigration intensity, either piecewise constant or adaptive logspline, estimated using an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The (positive) bias incurred by keeping the immigration intensity constant is small for time scales up to two hours, but can become as high as 0.3 for windows spanning days. This emphasizes the importance of choosing an appropriate model for the immigration intensity in the application of Hawkes processes to financial data and elsewhere. The branching ratio is also found to have an intraday seasonality, where it appears to be higher during times where market activity is dominated by supposedly reflexive automated decisions and a lack of fundamental news and trading. The insights into the microstructure of the two considered markets derived from our Hawkes process fits suggest that equity futures exhibit more complex non-stationary features, are more endogenous, persistent and traded at higher speed than spot foreign exchange.

However, it is well-known that in repetitive control, disturbance rejection at mid-frequencies, were non-periodic disturbances and noise may exist, is deteriorated. This study presents an enhancement, allowing to retain good disturbance rejection at mid-frequencies within the low-frequency portion of control bandwidth (relevant in practical systems) while trading-off the performance in the high-frequency control bandwidth part.

In this study, an intelligent decision support system is proposed for apple futures high-frequency trading. First, three eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) based models use the feature inputs from multiple time scales for return and direction prediction. Then, based on a pre-designed trading rule, the signals of long and short-selling are determined, and corresponding transactions are executed. In order to retain considerable profits in time and to avoid serious losses possibly caused by sudden and huge price changes toward the opposite direction as predictions, a position closing function is implemented in the trading rule. Meanwhile, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is employed to optimize the parameters of the trading rule as well as the XGBoost parameters. By evaluating the experimental results, we observed that the proposed approach successfully achieved the best performance in terms of direction prediction accuracy, transaction returns, as well as return/risk ratio.

Opponents counter by calling it an infringement on laissez-faire price discovery process citing the lack of conclusive evidence of their effectiveness in market crises. After nearly three decades of theoretical and empirical scrutiny, this discord persists. Most of the empirical focus in this domain revolves around ex-post performance of circuit breakers in cooling off the market, interference in trading, volatility splattering, and delayed assimilation of information. A less explored hypothesis is a potential for traders to hasten trading plans fearing illiquidity or trading blockade. Thus, the existence of the circuit breaker alone can induce its tripping. Known formally as the magnet effect, this hypothesis remains less explored due–inter alia–to paucity of data and methodological limitations. Greater availability of high-frequency datasets in recent times, however, has spurred a growth in empirical works focusing purely on the magnet effect hypothesis. As this nascent sub-discipline in market microstructure grows, this paper undertakes one of the first formal surveys looking to consolidate theoretical and empirical works on magnet effect. Moreover, we discuss methodological challenges and analytic limitations which strain the credibility of academic research findings in this domain; particularly among regulators. © 2020 Elsevier Inc."

However, the conditional probability of observing a price jump increases significantly, leading to a higher possibility of triggering market-wide circuit breakers, which is in support of the magnet effect hypothesis.

Researchers have identified share price, traded volume, market–capitalization, return volatility, and number of trades as the prime spread drivers. However, the validity of these determinants has not been explored in high-frequency trading. The present study attempts to articulate the validity of low-frequency determinants of the bid-ask spread in high-frequency trading. It used “bigglm” concept to estimate various determinants of spread, one of the study’s major contributions. The study found a positive relation between market–capitalization and spread, supporting the theory that a higher trading volume cannot decrease the bid-ask spread. Explanatory variables are all significant and show different impacts in different market conditions and sectors. For pooled data, share price, traded volume, quote return, trading frequency, and return volatility are in inverse relation with the spread. The study investigates sectoral determinants of the bid-ask spread to understand sector-specific influences. It also explores the influence of up and down market, settlement cycles, opening and closing intervals, and price and market-cap on determinants.

With the help of technical indicators, recent studies have shown that LSTM based deep learning models are able to predict price directions (a binary classification problem) with performance better than a random guess. However, only naive recurrent networks were adopted, and these works did not compare with the tools used by finance practitioners. Our experiments show that GARCH beats their LSTM models by a large margin. We propose to adopt an autoregressive recurrent network instead so that the loss of the prediction at every time step contributes to the model training; we also treat a rich set of technical indicators at each time step as covariates to enhance the model input. Finally, we treat the problem of price pattern forecast as a regression problem on the price itself; even for price direction prediction, we show that our performance is much better than if we model the problem as binary classification. We show that only when all these designs are adopted, an LSTM model can beat GARCH (and by a large margin). This work corrects the poor use of LSTM networks in recent studies, and provides ""the"" baseline that is able to fully unleash the power of LSTM for future work to compare with. Moreover, since our model is a price regressor with very good prediction performance, it can serve as a valuable tool for designing trading strategies (including day trading).

The results show the following: First, the low‐frequency factors include crude oil production, consumption, inventory, and natural gas spot price, and the high‐frequency factors include on‐market trading volume and off‐market spot price, which can significantly explain the volatility of oil price. Second, low‐frequency factors include crude oil inventory, consumption, crude oil production, and speculative factors, and high‐frequency factors include crude oil spot price and substitute prices. The increase in the volatility of trading volume is significantly positively correlated with oil price volatility, and the overall volatility model outperforms the horizontal effect model. Third, from the perspective of the combined effect of a single factor level and volatility, we find that supply and demand are the low‐frequency factors; the trading volume of on‐market factors, natural gas price, and crude oil spot price of off‐market factors, among the high‐frequency factors, are the most important factors affecting oil price volatility. Fourth, from the perspective of high‐frequency and low‐frequency effects combined, there is no significant difference between the various factor models, which shows that the mixed effect model of high and low frequency models has advantages in terms of the stability of the estimation results. © 2020 by the authors.

The ambitious goals of the Action Plan require private capital to be reoriented to more sustainable investment purposes. To this end, one key objective in the Action Plan is to foster transparency and long-termism in financial and economic activity, implemented among others through imposing new requirements on ESG-related disclosure on companies and financial market actors. This article investigates whether and how that policy objective is impacted by the ubiquitous market practice of high-frequency trading (HFT). Evidence suggests that HFT may have an inbuilt focus on short-term pricing signals. Furthermore, HFT can hamper the uptake of the new ESG-related disclosure requirements with negative effect for sustainable market outcomes. Neither the new regulatory initiatives nor the current regulatory measures in Directive 2014/65/EU (MiFID II) will alleviate these shortcomings. This constitutes a gap in the policy agenda relating to the institutional and organisational features of the current market structure. These issues should be given consideration in future policy-making assessments and efforts aiming to improve long-term sustainability in financial markets. Copyright © 2020 Author(s)."

Stock market prediction is one of the most popular and valuable areas in finance. In this paper, it proposes a stock prediction model using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) used as a generator that inputs historical stock price and generates future stock price and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as a discriminator to discriminate between the real stock price and generated stock price. Different from the traditional methods, which limited the forecasting on one-step-ahead only, by contrast, using the deep learning algorithm is possible to conduct the multi-step ahead prediction more accurately. In this study, it chose the Apple Inc. stock closing price as the target price, with features such as S&P 500 index, NASDAQ Composite index, U.S. Dollar index, etc. In addition, FinBert has been utilized to generate a news sentiment index for Apple Inc. as an additional predicting feature.

An event window approach is employed to capture the impact of these events on herding behavior and information uncertainty in the considered stock indices. Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA) is applied to compute the Hurst value in all the trading days of the event window. The results of both indices exhibit conclusive evidence of herding and bubble formation during the overall period of geopolitical tensions between India-China and India-Pakistan. However, the degree of herding in the stock indices intensifies to a profound pattern when the tensions between India and China escalated into deadly violent clashes, and also during the heightened tensions between India and Pakistan that eventually ended up in airstrikes across the boundaries.

However, relatively little is known about cryptocurrencies, their price behaviour, how quickly they incorporate new information and their corresponding market efficiency. To extend the current literature in this area, we develop four smart electronic Bitcoin markets populated with different types of traders using a special adaptive form of the Strongly Typed Genetic Programming (STGP)-based learning algorithm. We apply the STGP technique to historical data of Bitcoin at the one-minute and five-minute frequencies to investigate the formation of Bitcoin market dynamics and market efficiency. Through a plethora of robust testing procedures, we find that both Bitcoin markets populated by high-frequency traders (HFTs) are efficient at the one-minute frequency but inefficient at the five-minute frequency. This finding supports the argument that at the one-minute frequency investors are able to incorporate new information in a fast and rationale manner and not suffer from the noise associated with the five-minute frequency. We also contribute to the e-commerce literature by demonstrating that zero-intelligence traders cannot reach market efficiency, therefore providing evidence against the hypothesis of Hayek (1945; 1968). One practical implication of this study is that we demonstrate that e-commerce practitioners can apply artificial intelligence tools such as STGP to conduct behaviour-based market profiling. © 2020 Elsevier Inc."

We propose to model intraday log-prices through a multivariate local-level model with score-driven covariance matrices and to treat asynchronicity as a missing value problem. The main advantages of this approach are: (i) all available data are used when filtering the covariances, (ii) market microstructure noise is taken into account, (iii) estimation is performed by standard maximum likelihood.

It deals with any periodicity length, enables seasonality change over time, allows missing values, and is robust to outliers. However, it does not handle trading day variation by default. This study offers how to deal with this drawback. By applying multiple STL decompositions of 15-minute trading volume observations, three seasonal patterns were discovered: hourly, daily, and monthly. The research objective was not only to discover if multi-seasonality exists in trading volume by employing high-frequency data but also to determine which seasonal component is most time-varying, and which seasonal components are the strongest or weakest when comparing the variation in the magnitude between them. The results indicate that hourly seasonality is the strongest, while daily seasonality changes the most. A better understanding of trading volume multiple patterns can be very helpful in improving the performance of trading algorithms. ©2021 Croatian Operational Research"

Design/methodology/approach: After showing that market power exists in the financial market, this paper centers around the question of how market power is constructed in the financial market. To sharpen the answer to the question, the paper compares the conditions needed for market power construction in the financial market with those needed in the goods market. The paper selects spoofing, the frequently used order-based tactic in high-frequency trading strategies, to analyze in detail how spoof orders can ignite herding with market power building as the essence. The Flash Crash that occurred in the New York Stock Exchange on May 6, 2010 provides an excellent case of market power construction exhibited in spoofing. Findings: The behavioral mechanism of market power construction in the case of spoofing is perception alignment. It becomes effective when two necessary conditions are met: the spoof trader takes advantage of the incomplete order display set up by the exchange; and the behavioral weaknesses exhibited by numerous individual investors. In addition to these key conditions, this paper finds other ones for market power to be created in the financial market. They are easier, quicker, more secret, more flexible and less risky relative to the conditions for market power building in the goods market. Practical implications: The detailed analysis points to the behavioral mechanism, i.e. perception alignment, and microstructural mechanism, i.e. incomplete order display, that could be responsive to regulation. Originality/value: The originality of the findings is to uncover the mechanism of spoofing in taking advantage of behavioral biases of individual investors. The value is to gain more complete understanding of the essence of herding caused by spoofing. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited."

On the one hand, there was calculated the return from minute-level Bitcoin exchange quotes and use of both rolling variance and high-minus-low price to proxy for Bitcoin volatility per each trading hour. On the other hand, the mood signals from tweets were extracted based on a list of positive, negative, and uncertain words according to the Loughran-McDonald finance-specific dictionary. These signals were translated by categorizing each tweet into one of three sentiments, namely, bullish, bearish, and null. Then the total number of tweets were adopted in each category over one hour and their differences as potential Bitcoin price predictors. The empirical results indicate that after controlling a list of lagged returns and volatilities, stronger bullish sentiment significantly foreshadows higher Bitcoin return and volatility overthe time range of 24 hours. While bearish and neutral financial Twitter sentiments have no such consistent performance, the difference between bullish and bearish ratings can improve prediction consistency. Overall, this research results add to the growing Bitcoin literature by demonstrating that the Bitcoin pricing mechanism can be partially revealed by the momentum on sentiment in social media networks, justifying a sentimental appetite for cryptocurrency investment.  © Author(s) 2021."

It is the basis for formulating market policies and improving risk management capabilities. China's carbon price series are nonlinear and nonstationary, so it is difficult to predict accurately with traditional models. This paper proposes a multiscale ensemble prediction model based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD-ADD) to improve the prediction accuracy of carbon price. Firstly, EEMD is used to decompose the carbon price sequence into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), and these IMFs are divided into high-frequency component, low-frequency component and the trend component. Then, LSSVM, PSO-LSSVM, and BA-LSSVM are used to predict the three components respectively after comparative analysis. Finally, the results are combined to obtain the final prediction value. In the empirical analysis of the Hubei Emissions Exchange, the proposed model outperforms other comparative models. The RMSE, MAE, and MAPE values of the EEMD-ADD model are 0.6180, 0.4726, and 1.6342, and the DS, CP, and CD values are 94.36, 92.16, and 96.48. In addition, the model performed best in other time periods. The results suggest that the proposed model is effective and could predict carbon prices more accurately. © 2020 The Authors.

This can be considered a natural experiment, offering us the opportunity to explore the factors that affect the price discovery function of the Chinese futures market. Information shares, the price lead-lag relationship, intraday returns and volatility spillovers are tested to reflect the price discovery function at both the long- and short-term intraday levels. We further compare the two subsamples before and after the regulation using static and dynamic approaches. The results suggest that shortly after the new regulation, the futures market was more sensitive to new information which dominated the price discovery process. However, the price discovery function of a futures market became much weaker after the regulation in the long run, due to a lack of liquidity. The regulation increased only the short-run price leading effect of the futures market and stabilised the market by limiting intraday arbitrage. We find that margin trading in the stock market significantly affects the price discovery ability of the futures market.

The definition is rather broad and also encompasses “innovative ideas that improve financial service processes by proposing technological solutions according to different business situations, while the ideas could also lead to new business models or even new businesses.” Following the previous definitions, FinTech cannot be categorized as a brand new industry but rather as one that has evolved at an extremely rapid pace. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

The learning algorithm is used to determine the dynamics of a large population of technical trading strategies that can survive historical back-testing as well as form an overall aggregated portfolio trading strategy from the set of underlying trading strategies implemented on daily and intraday Johannesburg Stock Exchange data. The resulting population time-series are investigated using unsupervised learning for dimensionality reduction and visualisation. A key contribution is that the overall aggregated trading strategies are tested for statistical arbitrage using a novel hypothesis test, on both daily sampled and intraday time-scales. The (low frequency) daily sampled strategies fail the arbitrage tests after costs, while the (high frequency) intraday sampled strategies are not falsified as statistical arbitrages after costs. The estimates of trading strategy success, cost of trading and slippage are considered along with an offline benchmark portfolio algorithm for performance comparison. In addition, the algorithms generalisation error is analysed by recovering a probability of back-test overfitting estimate using a nonparametric procedure.

Using SPDR S&P 500 ETF datasets as a proxy for the market on regular volume trading days (November 3, 2016) and on high-volume trading days (November 9, 2016), we show that HFT, on average, has a disturbing action mainly on regular volume trading days, whereas on high-volume trading days, it appears to have a stabilizing effect by balancing both the volatility and bid-ask spread. That is, HFT as a whole has a more neutral impact on the market's volatility and bid-ask spread than the single aggressive and passive components. In fact, aggressive HFT has a consistent negative effect that increases, on average, both the volatility and bid-ask spread, whereas passive HFT displays a positive effect that decreases, on average, the volatility and bid-ask spread. © 2020 Elsevier Inc."

Likewise, FMD can spread to cattle farms via vehicles contaminated with the FMD virus. In Northern Thailand, the movement of manure transport vehicles and the circulation of manure bags among cattle farms are considered as potential risk factors for FMD outbreaks among cattle farms. This study aimed to determine the characteristics and movement patterns of manure tradesman using social network analysis. A structured questionnaire was used to identify sequences of farms routinely visited by each tradesman. A total of 611 participants were interviewed, including 154 beef farmers, 407 dairy farmers, 36 tradesmen, and 14 final purchasers. A static weighted directed one-mode network was constructed, and the network metrics were measured. For the manure tradesman-cattle farmer network, the tradesman possessed the highest value of in- and out-degree centralities (71 and 4), betweenness centralities (114.5), and k-core values (2). These results indicated that the tradesman had a high frequency of farm visits and had a remarkable influence on other persons (nodes) in the network. The movement of vehicles ranged from within local districts, among districts, or even across provinces. Unclean manure plastic bags were circulated among cattle farms. Therefore, both vehicles and the bags may act as a disease fomite. Interestingly, no recording system was implemented for the movement of manure transport vehicles. This study suggested that the relevant authority and stakeholders should be aware of the risk of FMD spreading within this manure trading network. The findings from this study can be used as supporting data that can be used for enhancing FMD control measures, especially for FMD endemic areas. © 2020 by the authors.

Such systems implement algorithmic trading strategies and are configured with predefined optimized parameters in order to generate entry and exit orders and execute trades on trading platforms. Three high-frequency automated trading systems were developed in the current research, using the MACD (oscillator), the SMA (moving average) and the PIVOT points (price crossover) technical indicators. The systems traded on hourly time frames, employing historical data of closing prices and the parameter optimization for each system was done using the d-Backtest PS method over weekly periods. With this work we intend to extend the methods of parameter selection for automated trading systems in high frequency trading. Through this research and the interpretation and evaluation of its results, we conclude that backtesting parameters’ optimization, especially through the d-Backtest PS method, is much more profitable than the default values of the parameters and that the optimization of parameters yields the highest profits through the implementation of restrictive relationships among them. It is also observed that the selection of the most profitable parameters of a trading system can be unrestricted, rendering the validation of the minor divergence occurring among slightly varying prices redundant. Meanwhile, other conclusions that can be drawn are that the most profitable classification system employed by the d-Backtest PS method is calibrated by means of two validation periods and that the most efficient profitability ratio between historical data period and validation period is 6:1 (in- and out-of-the-sample ratio). © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

Among the foremost such tasks in quantitative finance is the problem of optimal market making. Market making is the process of simultaneously quoting limit orders on both sides of the limit order book of a security with the goal of repeatedly capturing the quoted spread while minimizing the inventory risk. Most of the existing analytical approaches to market making tend to be predicated on a set of strong, naïve assumptions, whereas current machine learning-based approaches either resort to crudely discretized quotes or fail to incorporate additional predictive signals. In this paper, we present a novel framework for market making with signals based on model-free deep reinforcement learning, addressing these shortcomings. A new state space formulation incorporating outputs from standalone signal generating units, as well as a novel action space and reward function formulation, are introduced. The framework is underpinned by both ideas from adversarial reinforcement learning and neuroevolution. Experimental results on historical data demonstrate the superior reward-to-risk performance of the proposed framework over several standard market making benchmarks. More specifically, the resulting reinforcement learning agent achieves between 20-30% higher terminal wealth than the benchmarks while being exposed to only around 60% of their inventory risks. Finally, an insight into its policy is provided for the sake of interpretability.  © 2013 IEEE."

In this study, we used agent-based simulations to compare the major liquidity indicators in an artificial market where an HFT participated was compared to one where no HFT participated. The results showed that all liquidity indicators in the market where an HFT participated improved more than those in the market where no HFT participated. Furthermore, as a result of investigating the correlations between the major liquidity indicators in our simulations and the extant empirical literature, we found that market liquidity can be measured not only by the major liquidity indicators but also by execution rate. Therefore, it is suggested that it could be appropriate to employ execution rate as a novel liquidity indicator in future studies.  © 2014 IEEE."

Prompted by concerns that HFTs reap unfair advantages over other traders by using super-fast trading technologies, some regulatory proposals aim to curb HFTs’ ultra-low-latency activities. However, research suggests that HFTs also play beneficial roles in financial markets, including liquidity provision as voluntary market makers. Currently, little is known about their role in incorporating firm-specific fundamental information into prices. Employing a novel dataset that identifies trades by HFTs and non-HFTs, we find that earnings response coefficients are larger and abnormal price impact of trades are lower when HFTs trade more following earnings announcements, suggesting that HFTs facilitate efficient assimilation of earnings news. HFTs also enhance the forecasting capabilities of financial analysts. Furthermore, HFT participation increases return synchronicity around earnings announcements when multiple firms in the same industry announce earnings on the same day. The evidence suggests that HFTs help incorporate relevant industry information, and this effect arises from HFTs’ liquidity supplying function. We address the endogenous preference of HFTs for large and liquid stocks by including multiple controls for firm size and liquidity, implementing abnormal or change specification for the price impact tests, and performing pre-treatment placebo tests for all of our analyses. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

We show that high-frequency trading does not contribute to market instability, as measured by jump risk. The European bond market appears to be more vulnerable to downside (left-tail) jump risk, relative to the U.S. Treasury bond market. Market jump fear embedded in the VIX exhibits vertical clustering where both risk regimes at low frequencies remain unchanged at higher frequencies.

HFT activity poses a risk to the overarching regulatory objective of maintaining orderly trading conditions, because of its propensity to contribute to episodes of excessive volatility and flight of liquidity, popularly referred to as ‘flash crashes’. Such incidents could propagate and cause wider market turbulence and may - in worst case scenarios - become systemic. European legislators have responded to this risk by instituting regulation targeting HFT in MiFID II. This chapter identifies different characteristics of HFT activities that may challenge the efficacy of the European regulatory efforts. First, a lack of conceptual clarity and insight into HFT operations hampers the efforts of regulators to assess an appropriate level of regulation and to design effective rules. Furthermore, regulatory objectives are conflicting with each other, in particular the objectives of market efficiency and financial stability, which requires balancing them in this regulatory context. Moreover, novel traits of market structure and market functionality, including complexity, extreme velocity, cross-market connectivity and costly technology, challenge the ability of regulators and supervisors to uphold orderly HFT markets. Potential incentive problems might make any participation of market actors in designing relevant regulatory responses problematic. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Iris H-Y Chiu and Gudula Deipenbrock; individual chapters, the contributors."

The popularity of the Aussie dollar among currency traders belongs to the so-called three G’s-Geology, Geography and Government policy. The Australian economy is largely driven by commodities. The strength of the Australian dollar is counter-cyclical relative to other currencies and ties proximately to the geographical, commercial linkage with Asia and the commodity cycle. As such, we consider that the Australian dollar presents strong characteristics of the commodity currency. In this study, we provide an examination of the Australian dollar-US dollar rates.

Design/methodology/approach: Daily returns for 48 US industries over the period 1970–2019 from Kenneth French’s data library are used to calculate the higher moments and to construct short- and medium-term single-sort trading strategies. The analysis adjusts returns for common risk factors (market, size, value, investment, profitability and illiquidity) to confirm whether conventional asset pricing models can capture these relationships. Findings: Past skewness positively relates to subsequent industry returns and this relationship is unexplained by common risk factors. There is also a time-varying effect in which the predictive role of skewness is much stronger over business cycle expansions than recessions, a result consistent with varying investor optimism. However, there is no significant relationship between kurtosis and subsequent industry returns. The analysis confirms robustness using both value- and equal-weighted returns. Research limitations/implications: The calculation of realized moments conventionally uses high-frequency intra-day data, regrettably unavailable for industries. In addition, the chosen portfolio-sorting method may omit some information, as it compares only average group returns. Nonetheless, the close relationship between skewness and future returns at the industry level suggests variations in returns unexplained by common risk factors. This enriches knowledge of market anomalies and questions yet again weak-form market efficiency and the validity of conventional asset pricing models. One suggestion is that it is possible to significantly improve the existing multi-factor asset pricing models by including industry skewness as a risk factor. Practical implications: Given the relationship between skewness and future returns at the industry level, investors may predict subsequent industry returns to select better-performing funds. They may even construct trading strategies based on return distributions that would generate abnormal returns. Further, as the evaluation of individual stocks also contains industry information, and stocks in industries with better performance earn higher returns, risks related to industry return distributions can also shed light on individual stock picking. Originality/value: While there is abundant evidence of the relationships between higher moments and future returns at the firm level, there is little at the industry level. Further, by testing whether there is time variation in the relationship between industry higher moments and future returns, the paper yields novel evidence concerning the asymmetric effect of stock return predictability over business cycles. Finally, the analysis supplements firm-level results focusing only on the decomposed components of higher moments. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Consistent with findings in other markets, we show that the first half-hour return can readily predict the last half-hour return. We further demonstrate that the magnitude of this intraday momentum varies with volatility, trading volume, trade size, the sign of the first half-hour return, the type of commodity futures, and the launch of night trading.

Instead of using existing entropy measures, this paper proposed a new indicator based on transaction dataset that enables us to inspect both the direction and the magnitude of this imbalance at high frequency, which we call ""polarity"". The polarity aims to measure the unevenness of the very essence trading desire based on the most micro decision making units. We investigate the relationship between the polarity and the return at both market-level and stock-level and find that the autocorrelated polarities cause a positive relation between lagged polarities and returns, while the current polarity is the opposite. It is also revealed that these associations shift according to the market conditions. In fact, when aggregating the one-minute polarities into daily signals, we find not only significant correlations disclosed by the market polarity and market emotion, but also the reliability of these signals in terms of reflecting the transitions of market-level behavior. These results imply that our presented polarity can reflect the market sentiment and condition in real time. Indeed, the trading polarity provides a new indicator from a high-frequency perspective to understand and foresee the market's behavior in a data-driven manner. © 2020 by the authors."

The paper investigates the problem of price discovery on markets with trades recorded at sub-millisecond frequencies. The application of the popular information share measure of Hasbrouck (1995) to such data faces several difficulties, as the underlying vector error correction models would need a huge number of lags to capture dynamics at different time-scales. The problem is handled by imposing a set of restrictions on parameters inspired by the Heterogeneous Autoregressive model for realized volatility. We illustrate some potential drawbacks of the information share measure adopted in the paper and propose a modeling strategy aimed at dealing with such limitations. In particular, we introduce a structural multi-market model with a lagged adjustment mechanism describing lagged absorption of information across markets. The advantages of the method are shown in simulations. © The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. For permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oup.com"

The typical effects of futures expirations include the impact on the trading volume of the underlying asset, abnormally high volatility of the returns on expiration day, and price reversal after expiration. In line with observations of the effects for other markets, it can also be noticed that futures expiration is a source of rises in trading volume for the WSE. There is an observed significant abnormal trading volume and turnover of stocks that are underlying assets of futures as well as an increased volatility of these stocks’ returns on expiration day. An additional analysis conducted during three sub-periods (around April 15, 2013, and May 31, 2015) checks whether the implementation of a new transaction system on the WSE and the changes in short-selling rules influenced the expiration-day effects. The results suggest that the implementation of a new regulation by the EU on the WSE concerning short selling in trading on stock exchanges had a significant impact on expiration-day effects. © 2019, The Author(s)."

In this context, the limit orders, market orders, and cancel orders arrivals in the order book are modeled as point processes with intensities that only depend on the state of the order book. These are high-dimensional models which are realistic from a micro-structure point of view and have been recently developed in the literature. In this context, we consider a market maker who stands ready to buy and sell stock on a regular and continuous basis at a publicly quoted price, and identifies the strategies that maximize their P&L penalized by their inventory. An extension of the methodology is proposed to solve market-making problems where the orders arrivals are modeled using Hawkes processes with exponential kernel. We apply the theory of Markov Decision Processes and dynamic programming method to characterize analytically the solutions to our optimal market-making problem. The second part of the paper deals with the numerical aspect of the high-dimensional trading problem. We use a control randomization method combined with quantization method to compute the optimal strategies. Several computational tests are performed on simulated data to illustrate the efficiency of the computed optimal strategy. In particular, we simulated an order book with constant/ symmetric/ asymmetrical/ state dependent intensities, and compared the computed optimal strategy with naive strategies.

The innovation is successful, and HFT is highly and consistently profitable. However, the Flash Crash on 6 May 2010 exposed the unfamiliar side of HFT, thus illuminating the emergent need to unveil the negative impact that HFT has on other investors and the market. This paper examines data regarding quote-stuffing, spoofing, and market making provided by high-frequency (HF) traders, based on the increasing empirical literature. It first defines order-based manipulation (OBM) as the framework under which quote-stuffing, spoofing, and HF market making find common ground. It then provides details regarding how OBM is displayed in the three manipulation tactics. In essence, they all seek and exercise monopoly power in trading albeit through different ways of achieving it. The shared purpose is to gain monopolistic profit. The essence and common purpose explain why HF traders are not net liquidity providers, contrary to some proponents’ conclusions. Rather, this paper points out the three consequences that HF traders have brought to the market, i.e. increased volatility, increased frequency of unfairness, and instability potential.

Using high-frequency data for the US stock market in Wharton Research Data Services' Trade and Quote database, our empirical findings suggest a significant nonlinear and time-varying contemporary relationship between return and realized volatility, ranging from positive to negative with an up-down-up pattern, summarized as follows. First, the contemporary relationship is positive on inactive trading days when the trading volume is smaller than usual, in which case traders may face no new information or event uncertainty. Second, the relationship is significantly negative when the trading volume is large on active trading days, in which case traders may be overconfident and behave in a risk-seeking fashion. Third, the risk premium tends toward zero during extremely abnormal trading days. Finally, low and high levels of trading volume have asymmetrical influences on risk premia, with a larger absolute value of risk premia for high levels of trading volume. Furthermore, the nonlinear changing autocorrelation of returns is insignificant from zero on normal trading days and most likely different from zero on abnormal trading days.

The study attempts to document the recent theoretical developments and empirical findings from the literature exhaustively and identifies the research gaps for future research. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses seven reputable databases to select 2,514 research studies spanning over 1981-2018 (finally compressed to a pool of 103 articles, based on relevance and impact). The study uses bibliometric network visualization and text analytics to categorize and examine the literature. The chosen articles are compiled and analyzed to provide a comprehensive account of the current research on LOBs. Findings: The recent LOB literature is summarized on various criteria as follows: sub-areas, the types of economies and markets, methodologies and the LOB measures. The review identifies a dearth of studies on the LOBs in emerging markets. It suggests the potential research areas as intraday studies in emerging LOB markets; application of market indicators based on deeper levels of LOB, beyond the best prices; market fragmentation, order routing decision and its impact on order execution quality; optimal display of LOB levels; liquidity dynamics in quote-driven markets vis-à-vis LOB markets; effect of high-frequency trading on market microstructure; application of advanced techniques (e.g. machine learning models, zero-intelligent models); relationship between the trading speed, order aggressiveness, shape and resilience of the order book and informed trading; and information content of the auxiliary order submission strategies, including cancellation, amendments and hidden orders.

High-frequency trading could be seen as a manifestation of this development. A review of the main findings in the academic literature leads to the identification of four main systemic vulnerabilities related to high-frequency trading: (i) adverse selection in orders, with the potential of crowding-out non-HFT market makers in times of stress; (ii) correlation of positions and herd behaviour; (iii) market power that, via technological costs, may impose barriers to entry; and (iv) negative contribution, in some circumstances, to price discovery. The first vulnerability could create systemic risk and several scholars have discussed the introduction of a limit in the speed of trading to address it. This could also contribute to reduce market power of high-frequency traders and over-investment in information technologies. Despite intense research efforts, further data and research is still needed to better understand these vulnerabilities and the adequacy of policies to address them. © 2021 De Gruyter Oldenbourg.

We document and quantify the widespread and rising deployment of arbitrage bots in blockchain systems, specifically in decentralized exchanges (or ""DEXes""). Like high-frequency traders on Wall Street, these bots exploit inefficiencies in DEXes, paying high transaction fees and optimizing network latency to frontrun, i.e., anticipate and exploit, ordinary users' DEX trades.We study the breadth of DEX arbitrage bots in a subset of transactions that yield quantifiable revenue to these bots. We also study bots' profit-making strategies, with a focus on blockchain-specific elements. We observe bots engage in what we call priority gas auctions (PGAs), competitively bidding up transaction fees in order to obtain priority ordering, i.e., early block position and execution, for their transactions. PGAs present an interesting and complex new continuous-time, partial-information, game-theoretic model that we formalize and study. We release an interactive web portal, frontrun.me, to provide the community with real-time data on PGAs.We additionally show that high fees paid for priority transaction ordering poses a systemic risk to consensus-layer security. We explain that such fees are just one form of a general phenomenon in DEXes and beyond - what we call miner extractable value (MEV) - that poses concrete, measurable, consensus-layer security risks. We show empirically that MEV poses a realistic threat to Ethereum today.Our work highlights the large, complex risks created by transaction-ordering dependencies in smart contracts and the ways in which traditional forms of financial-market exploitation are adapting to and penetrating blockchain economies. © 2020 IEEE."

More importantly, we show that this effect is due to HFT's liquidity supplying role (i.e., passive HFT fulfilling market orders), not liquidity demanding role (i.e., HFT initiating market orders). The results also reveal that the effect is more pronounced when earnings surprises are extreme and large.

The purpose of this paper is to forecast the intraday values of stock indices using data mining techniques and compare the techniques’ performance in different markets to accomplish the best results. Design/methodology/approach: This study investigates the intraday values (every 60th-minute closing value) of four different markets (namely, UK, Australia, India and China) spanning from April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018. The forecasting performance of multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARSplines), support vector regression (SVR), backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and autoregression (1) are compared using statistical measures. Robustness evaluation is done to check the performance of the models on the relative ratios of the data. Findings: MARSplines produces better results than the compared models in forecasting every 60th minute of selected stocks and stock indices. Next to MARSplines, SVR outperforms neural network and autoregression (1) models. The MARSplines proved to be more robust than the other models. Practical implications: Forecasting provides a substantial benchmark for companies, which entails long-run operations. Significant profit can be earned by successfully predicting the stock’s future price. The traders have to outperform the market using techniques. Policy makers need to estimate the future prices/trends in the stock market to identify the link between the financial instruments and monetary policy which gives higher insights about the mechanism of existing policy and to know the role of financial assets in many channels. Thus, this study expects that the proposed model can create significant profits for traders by more precisely forecasting the stock market. Originality/value: This study contributes to the high-frequency forecasting literature using MARSplines, SVR and BPNN. Finding the most effective way of forecasting the stock market is imperative for traders and portfolio managers for investment decisions.

The research methodology employed includes wavelet correlation, wavelet multiple cross-correlation and wavelet coherence. Results show a positive correlation across intra and inter trading blocs in all investment horizons and over time, and they show that the linkage between stock returns increases with the time scale, implying that the international diversification benefits have largely disappeared in globalized world markets. Moreover, we found a high degree of co-movement at low frequencies in crisis and no crisis periods, which indicates a fundamental relationship between stock market returns. Finally, multiple cross-correlation analysis reveals that stock markets are positively correlated at all wavelet scales and at all lags, and it reveals that France’s stock market is the potential leader or follower of the other European and other major world stock markets at low and high frequencies. © 2021 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

The purpose of our study is to comparatively evaluate a plethora of Artificial Intelligence systems in forecasting high frequency Bitcoin price series. We employ three different sets of models, i.e., statistical machine learning approaches including support vector regressions (SVR) and Gaussian Poisson regressions (GRP), algorithmic models such as regression trees (RT) and the k-nearest neighbours (kNN) and finally artificial neural network topologies such as feedforward (FFNN), Bayesian regularization (BRNN) and radial basis function networks (RBFNN). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an extensive empirical investigation of the comparative predictability of various machine learning models is implemented in high-frequency trading of Bitcoin. The entropy analysis of training and testing samples reveals long memory traits, high levels of stochasticity, and topological complexity. The presence of inherent nonlinear dynamics of Bitcoin time series fully rationalizes the use of advanced machines learning techniques. The optimal parameter values for SVR, GRP and kNN are found via Bayesian optimization. Based on diverse performance metrics, our results show that the BRNN renders an outstanding accuracy in forecasting, while its convergence is unhindered and remarkably fast. The overall superiority of artificial neural networks is due to parallel processing features that efficiently emulate human decision-making in the presence of underlying nonlinear input-output relationships in noisy signal environments. © 2020"

The theoretical model shows that the information-based profits in secondary market make institutional investors bid inadequately. In order to reduce the moral hazard of the inadequate quotation, the market maxes the subscription share of institutional investors with high bidding price, resulting in a high tendency to overbid for institutional investors. In further empirical analysis, based on the detailed quotation data of 1234 IPO companies listed in China's A-shares from October 2010 to June 2018, this paper analyzes the overbidding behavior of different type of institutional investors and the overbidding behavior in different industries and in different stages, showing that the tendency of overbidding is affected differently by the information-based profits in secondary market. This paper considers firstly the influence of the information-based profits in secondary market on the institutional investors' quotes and finds that the institutional investors have the moral hazard of ""leave the information on the table"".

For instance, the return for Nigeria is denoted by ‘NGEr’.The denoised stock returns is denoted by ‘-rd’ where ‘-’ denote the stock variable. For instance, the denoised return for Nigeria is denoted by ‘NGErd’.We also looked at the effect of noise on the dynamics of the market. We used some wavelet based measures of co-movement to analyze the market dynamics. The data cover the period from 5th September 2017 to 24th of May 2019 a length of 512. This period falls in the period Nigeria experienced her second worst recession in history. The summary statistics shows that the Iranian stock (RANI3) has some quite interesting properties. The standard deviation of its price is the least with a value of 0.43 and highest positive skewness of 0.62. Its returns however has the highest standard deviation of 0.03, highest skewness of 2.08 and the highest kurtosis of 31.7. The wavelet power spectrum shows that most of the power and variability are concentrated at the lower scales (higher frequencies). It can be seen in the stock returns that most of the power as well as the variability is seen in the lower scales 0–16 (higher frequencies) while lower power is mostly seen at higher scale 32–128 (lower frequencies). The 1D scalogram, showed that for the return series. The energy peaks between 0 and 4 scale and decreases almost linearly. The denoised series has a very contrasting scenario; the energy is at its lowest at scale 0–32 and then rises sharply to its peak(s) and then descends again. We conclude that there is a very strong co-movement among the N11 countries and that the presence of noise has almost the same effect in the time frequency domain for all the N11 countries. It can be said that most of the market dynamics of the N11 countries in the lower scales (high frequency) are driven by noise while the dynamics of the higher scale (low frequency) are driven by market fundamentals. Finally, from our results, we deduced that the skewness and the kurtosis can be used to determine the energy distribution in a wavelet decomposition. © 2020"

Design/methodology/approach: This paper analyzes the basic characteristics of market yield volatility based on the five-minute trading data of the Chinese CSI300 stock index futures from 2012 to 2017 by Hurst index and GPH test, A-J and J-O Jumping test and Realized-EGARCH model, respectively. The results show that the yield fluctuation rate of CSI300 stock index futures market has obvious non-linear characteristics including long memory, jumpy and asymmetry. Findings: This paper finds that the LHAR-RV-CJ model has a better prediction effect on the volatility of CSI300 stock index futures. The research shows that CSI300 stock index futures market is heterogeneous, means that long-term investors are focused on long-term market fluctuations rather than short-term fluctuations; the influence of the short-term jumping component on the market volatility is limited, and the long jump has a greater negative influence on market fluctuation; the negative impact of long-period yield is limited to short-term market fluctuation, while, with the period extending, the negative influence of long-period impact is gradually increased. Research limitations/implications: This paper has research limitations in variable measurement and data selection. Practical implications: This study is based on the high-frequency data or the application number of financial modeling analysis, especially in the study of asset price volatility. It makes full use of all kinds of information contained in high-frequency data, compared to low-frequency data such as day, weekly or monthly data. High-frequency data can be more accurate, better guide financial asset pricing and risk management, and result in effective configuration. Originality/value: The existing research on the futures market volatility of high frequency data, mainly focus on single feature analysis, and the comprehensive comparative analysis on the volatility characteristics of study is less, at the same time in setting up the model for the forecast of volatility, based on the model research on the basic characteristics is less, so the construction of a model is relatively subjective, in this paper, considering the fluctuation characteristics of the model is more reasonable, characterization of volatility will also be more explanatory power. The difference between this paper and the existing literature lies in that this paper establishes a prediction model based on the basic characteristics of market return volatility, and conducts a description and prediction study on volatility. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Following Dittmar and Field (2015), this paper uses relative transaction prices to ascertain the relative performance of own stock transactions, in the open market and over the counter. Findings: Results show that firms can time both repurchases as well as resales. Firms repurchase (resell) at lower (higher) prices than those prevailing in the market.

However, their ability to use services such as cloud computing, VoIP, media streaming, high-frequency trading, network gaming, video conferencing and telemedicine, are sensitive to the network quality of service (QoS). We examine the effects of pro-competition regulation on Internet QoS - a measure of digital divide - using 23 indicators of competition from a panel of 160 countries covering 2008–2016. We find that pro-competition regulations had a stronger positive effect on QoS in developed countries compared to developing ones. A one-point increase in the pro-competition score increases QoS, measured as average connection speed, by at least 200 kbps in developed countries. Our results control for supply and demand factors, as well as country-fixed effects. The results are also robust to different measures of average connection speed. We attribute this variation to difficulties in the contracting environment in developed and developing countries, consistent with Levy and Spiller (1996). Countries with better institutional endowments – associated with developed economies - are better able to design and enforce complex regulatory contracts compared to developing countries. Ironically, this means that more pro-competition rules on paper will not necessarily narrow the digital divide between developed and developing countries and that there is a need to consider minimum quality standards as a means to effect improved Internet QoS. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"

These digital currencies have garnered significant interest from investment banks and portfolio managers as a potential option to diversify the financial risk from investing in other assets. This interest has also extended to the general public who have seen cryptocurrencies as a way of making a quick profit. This paper provides a first insight into the applicability of high frequency momentum trading strategies for cryptocurrencies. We implemented two variations of a signal-based momentum trading strategy: (i) a time series method; (ii) a cross sectional method. These strategies were tested on a selection of seven of the largest cryptocurrencies ranked by market capitalization. The results show that there exists potential for the momentum strategy to be used successfully for cryptocurrency trading in a high frequency setting. A comparison with a passive portfolio strategy is proposed, which shows abnormal returns when compared with the momentum strategies. Furthermore, the robustness of our results are checked through the application of the momentum strategies other sample periods. We also compare the performances of the signal-based momentum strategies with returns-based versions of the strategies. It is shown that the signal-based strategy outperforms the returns-based strategy. However, there appears to be no single parameterization of the signal-based strategies that can generate the greatest cumulative return over all sample periods. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."

(2020). We find that sorting on signed small jump variation leads to greater value-weighted return differentials between stocks in our highest-and lowest-quintile portfolios (i.e., high–low spreads) than when either signed total jump or signed large jump variation is sorted on. It is shown that the benefit of signed small jump variation investing is driven by stock selection within an industry, rather than industry bets. Investors prefer stocks with a high probability of having positive jumps, but they also tend to overweight safer industries. Also, consistent with the findings in Scaillet et al. (2018), upside (downside) jump variation negatively (positively) predicts future returns. However, signed (large/small/total) jump variation has stronger predictive power than both upside and downside jump variation. One reason large and small (signed) jump variation have differing marginal predictive contents is that the predictive content of signed large jump variation is negligible when controlling for either signed total jump variation or realized skewness. By contrast, signed small jump variation has unique information for predicting future returns, even when controlling for these variables. By analyzing earnings announcement surprises, we find that large jumps are closely associated with “big” news. However, while such news-related information is embedded in large jump variation, the information is generally short-lived, and dissipates too quickly to provide marginal predictive content for subsequent weekly returns. Finally, we find that small jumps are more likely to be diversified away than large jumps and tend to be more closely associated with idiosyncratic risks. This indicates that small jumps are more likely to be driven by liquidity conditions and trading activity. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

In this paper, we provide evidences on the magnet effect of circuit breaker using high-frequency market index returns and individual stock returns. Furthermore, our empirical tests for the individual stock returns suggest that magnet effect of circuit breaker does not only coexist but also interacts with the magnet effect of price ceiling limit. Based on a small group of stocks that hit their price ceilings during the market collapse, the magnet effect of price ceiling is found to accelerate when a trigger of market-wide circuit breaker is more likely.

A recent line of financial research centers around trading through financial data on the microscopic level, which is the holy grail of high-frequency trading (HFT), as the higher the data frequency, the more profitable opportunities may appear. The advancement in HFT modeling has also facilitated more understanding towards price formation because the supply and demand of a stock can be comprehended more easily from the microstructure of the order book. Instead of traditional statistical methods, there has been increasing demand for the development of more reliable prediction models due to the recent progress in Computational Intelligence (CI) technologies. In this study, we aim to develop novel CI-based methodologies for the forecasting task of price movement in HFT. Our goal is to conduct a study for autonomous genetic-based models that allow the forecasting systems to self-evolve.

We find that high frequency traders have a particularly high success rate on each transaction, measured by the likelihood that the following price change will go in their direction as well as by the amount of time they have to wait to realize their gain, when trading against low frequency traders. Contrary to common wisdom, we find that high frequency traders’ activity does not induce volatility or jumps. In fact, it is their absence that is problematic: volatility and jumps are more prevalent in periods when they trade less intensely. Conversely, we find that spikes in volatility and jumps cause high frequency traders to trade less intensely, decreasing their provision of liquidity. Finally, looking at the market microstructure noise component to the price model, we find that higher level of noise generates trading opportunities for high frequency traders and lead them to increase their trading activity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."

The results show that institutional investors react to negative environmental events prior to the announcements, indicating premature information leakage in the market; in addition, their trading behaviors mitigate the immediate effect of negative environmental event announcements on stock price. After the event is disclosed, institutional investors engage in short-term selling and long-term buy and hold. This trading strategy undermines the irrational selling of individual investors in the event of disclosure, short-term decline in stock price, and long-term reversal of market overreaction.

Because of its highly volatile nature, there is a need for good predictions on which to base investment decisions. Although existing studies have leveraged machine learning for more accurate Bitcoin price prediction, few have focused on the feasibility of applying different modeling techniques to samples with different data structures and dimensional features. To predict Bitcoin price at different frequencies using machine learning techniques, we first classify Bitcoin price by daily price and high-frequency price. A set of high-dimension features including property and network, trading and market, attention and gold spot price are used for Bitcoin daily price prediction, while the basic trading features acquired from a cryptocurrency exchange are used for 5-minute interval price prediction. Statistical methods including Logistic Regression and Linear Discriminant Analysis for Bitcoin daily price prediction with high-dimensional features achieve an accuracy of 66%, outperforming more complicated machine learning algorithms. Compared with benchmark results for daily price prediction, we achieve a better performance, with the highest accuracies of the statistical methods and machine learning algorithms of 66% and 65.3%, respectively. Machine learning models including Random Forest, XGBoost, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machine and Long Short-term Memory for Bitcoin 5-minute interval price prediction are superior to statistical methods, with accuracy reaching 67.2%.

Usually referred to as 'Long Memory', LRD has remained a key parameter even today since the mid-1970s. In November 2016, a sudden and drastic demonetization measure took place in the Indian market, aimed at curbing money laundering and terrorist funding. This study is an attempt to identify market behavior using long-range dependence during those few days in demonetization. Besides, it tries to identify nascent traces of bubble and embedded herding during that time. Auto Regressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average (ARFIMA) is used for three consecutive days around the event. Tick-by-tick data from CNX Nifty High Frequency Trading (CNX Nifty HFT) is used for three consecutive days around demonetization (approximately, 5000 data points from morning trading sessions on each of the three days). The results show a clear and profound presence of herd behavior in all three data sets. The herd intensity remained similar, indicating a unique mixture of both 'Noah Effect' and 'Joseph Effect', proving a clear regime switch. However, the results on the event day show stable and prominent herding.

We demonstrate the role of overnight volatility information by estimating heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) model specifications with and without a trading period market risk factor using ten years of high-frequency data for the 431 constituents of the S&P 500 index. The stocks’ own overnight squared returns perform poorly across stocks and forecast horizons, as well as in the asset allocation exercise. In contrast, we find overwhelming evidence that the market-level volatility, proxied by S&P Mini futures, matters significantly for improving the model fit and volatility forecasting accuracy. The greatest model fit and forecast improvements are found for short-term forecast horizons of up to five trading days, and for the non-trading period market-level volatility. The documented increase in forecast accuracy is found to be associated with the stocks’ sensitivity to the market risk factor. Finally, we show that both the trading and non-trading period market realized volatilities are relevant in an asset allocation context, as they increase the average returns, Sharpe ratios and certainty equivalent returns of a mean–variance investor. © 2019 International Institute of Forecasters"

The intensities of the orders she receives depend not only on the spreads she quotes but also on unobservable factors modelled by a hidden Markov chain. We tackle this stochastic control problem under partial information with a model that unifies and generalizes many existing ones under full information, combining several risk metrics and constraints, and using general decreasing intensity functionals. We use stochastic filtering, control and piecewise-deterministic Markov processes theory, to reduce the dimensionality of the problem and characterize the reduced value function as the unique continuous viscosity solution of its dynamic programming equation. We then solve the analogous full information problem and compare the results numerically through a concrete example. We show that the optimal full information spreads are biased when the exact market regime is unknown, and the market maker needs to adjust for additional regime uncertainty in terms of P&L sensitivity and observed order flow volatility. This effect becomes higher, the longer the waiting time in between orders. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Scaling up economic pressures for efficiency and reliability of the power system has necessitated a requirement for maintaining system frequency, and tie-line power flows as close as possible to scheduled values. High-frequency deviations may degrade load performance, damage equipment, resulting in overloading of transmission lines, which may interfere with system protection schemes, and, finally, may also result in an unstable condition of the power system. More so, Load Frequency Control (LFC) plays a vital role in the modern power system as an auxiliary service to support power exchanges and, at the same time, to provide better conditions for the trading of electricity. Therefore, the tuning of the dynamic controller (i.e., net frequency and net power interchange errors) is a significant factor in achieving optimum LFC performance. Appropriate tuning of the controller parameters is required in order to achieve excellent control action. In view of this, this paper introduces the dynamic tuning of controller parameters in a two-area multi-source power system with an AC-DC parallel tie line for optimum load-frequency control performance. Matlab/Simulink software is used to realize the system simulation. System dynamic performance is observed for conventional PID tuning by the Ziegler Nichols method and the Kitamori method, fuzzy logic controllers, fuzzy-logic PID controllers, fuzzy PID controllers, and polar-Fuzzy controllers. Furthermore, the frequency and tie-line power response of the interconnected areas were compared based on the setting-time, peak-overshoot, and peakundershoot. The simulation results show that the responses of the fuzzy-based controllers are faster than those of the classical controllers, resulting in minimized frequency and tie-line power deviations. © 2020 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland."

However, as in most of the classical forecasting methods, its accuracy is strongly tied to the degree of signal complexity. Specifically, stock market prices are commonly classified to be non-linear, non-stationary and chaotic signals, since they exhibit erratic behavior that conducts a poor performance in the long short-term memory (LSTM). In this paper, we propose a methodology to improve the predictability of financial time series by using the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise and the intrinsic sample entropy (SampEn). We evaluated the integrated model by applying it to SP 500 index stocks for the period between January 2018 and April 2020 and for each time series of stock closing prices, an LSTM model was trained to forecast the next closing price. The experimental results represent a dependency between the decomposed signal entropy and the performance of forecast accuracy. This suggests that in those cases where the short-term complexity in financial time series is smaller compared to the series energy, the forecasting capabilities are significantly improved after the removal of decomposed highest frequency. Furthermore, our results show an improvement in forecasting the direction of the stock price by 31% using the classical LSTM architecture. © 2013 IEEE."

Buy market orders (MOs) exert a short-lived upward pressure on the midprice, whereas sell MOs exert a short-lived downward pressure on the midprice. We employ Nasdaq high-frequency data to estimate model parameters and to illustrate the performance of the market making strategy. The market maker employs the alpha signal to minimise adverse selection costs, execute directional trades in anticipation of price changes, and to manage inventory risk. As the market maker increases their tolerance to inventory risk, the expected profits that stem from the alpha signal increase because the strategy employs more speculative MOs and performs more roundtrip trades with limit orders.  © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company."

Specifically, utilizing the single wavelet power spectrum, the multiple wavelet coherency, the partial wavelet coherency, also combined with the partial phase difference and the partial wavelet gains, this paper discovers the time-frequency interaction between three markets.

The BIMA framework uses Monte Carlo simulation, the Black-Scholes-Merton model, and the Heston model for performing financial, operational, and liquidity risk analysis and present outputs in the form of analytics and visualization. Our results and analysis demonstrate supplier bankruptcy modeling, risk pricing, high-frequency pricing simulations, London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) rate simulation, and speculation detection results to provide a variety of critical risk analysis. Our approaches to tackle problems caused by financial services and the operational risk clearly demonstrate that the BIMA framework, as the outputs of our data analytics research, can effectively combine integrity and risk analysis together with overall business performance and can contribute to operational risk research. © 2020 by the authors."

In the stock market, the daily trading activities of stocks are carried out at different frequencies and cycles, resulting in a multi-frequency trading mode of stocks , which provides useful clues for future price trends: short-term stock forecasting relies on high-frequency trading data, while long-term forecasting pays more attention to low-frequency data. In addition, stock series have strong volatility and nonlinearity, so stock forecasting is very challenging. In order to explore the multi-frequency mode of the stock , this paper proposes an adaptive wavelet transform model (AWTM). AWTM integrates the advantages of XGboost algorithm, wavelet transform, LSTM and adaptive layer in feature selection, time–frequency decomposition, data prediction and dynamic weighting. More importantly, AWTM can automatically focus on different frequency components according to the dynamic evolution of the input sequence, solving the difficult problem of stock prediction. This paper verifies the performance of the model using S&P500 stock dataset.

As one kind of innovative financial products in the Chinese fund market, its trading mechanism needs to be improved. This can be explored through experimental financial research. Although the existing literature by computational methods has analyzed arbitrage trading behavior of other financial products, there is no research to study Chinese ETF arbitrage by simulation tools, and most of the arbitrage models neglect the hedging cost, the impact cost of cross-market arbitrage, as well as different types of traders and so on. This study analyzed the data of fourteen ETF funds with different listing time and ETF 510300, which concerns component stocks of the CSI 300 in China. First, of all, we build the trading market simulation model and system based on Netlogo. It considers the hedging cost, the impact cost of cross-market arbitrage, trader type, and other factors simultaneously. Furthermore，it quantitatively analyzes cross-market arbitrage and future-spot arbitrage process and presents a comparative study by history and simulation results. In the first part of the article, after considering differences of investment strategies adopted by different investors, trading tactics in Netlogo will be divided into the following four types: noise investment strategy, the fundamental value investment strategy, flock investment strategy, and momentum investment strategy, a simulation system of Netlogo trading market is constructed accordingly. In the second part of the writing, we develop two main arbitrage models: ETF fund’s cross-market arbitrage and future-spot arbitrage, and calculate the positive and reverse arbitrage boundaries of these two methods through no-arbitrage equilibrium analysis. In the third part of the paper, the simulation results of the return rate of ETF and stock index future by Netlogo are analyzed to verify the accuracy of the simulation method. After the relevant model is previously established, we develop algorithm programming for two kinds of arbitrage process by Matlab. Finally, it makes a comparative analysis of results. The main conclusions are as follows. First of all, based on one-minute high-frequency data of fifteen ETF funds and CSI 300 stock index futures, it shows that the simulation results of Netlogo are close to the distribution characteristic of the ETF fund’s history price. Furthermore, using Netlogo to simulate the average return rate of different types of investors’ on the ETF market, this study finds that the highest is fundamental investor, and noise investors the lowest. The finding matches with the real situation of China’s securities market, and it also proves the Netlogo system constructed in this paper has a certain accuracy. Second of all, after analyzing the empirical results of fifteen ETF funds’ cross-market arbitrage, we find many important findings. First, for the average value of cross-market arbitrage, both the real data and analog data, all ETF funds’ reverse arbitrage opportunities increase as trading period increases, and the number of positive arbitrage chance is significantly less than the reverse arbitrage, which indicates that cross-market reverse arbitrage has much more opportunities than positive arbitrage. In addition, the simulation results of quotas, such as the number of arbitrage times of over bounds, the number of instantaneous arbitrage over bounds times, the average number of consecutive arbitrage over bounds, and the average daily return rate of consecutive arbitrage over the upper bounds, are significantly larger than those of historical price. However, the deviation of the historical value decreases as the sample duration increases, which also indicates that a short simulation period will cause poor simulation results. Second, from the average value of intra-market arbitrage and the condition of the full sample, the simulated deviation rate of continuous overbound return rate is minimal in the all quotas. It also shows that the volatility of the continuous arbitrage return rate is relatively small when the simulation period is longer, and the investment income tends to be stable. This finding is also consistent. The realistic characteristics of the low volatility degree of ETF fund show that the Netlogo simulation system built in this study is ideal. Third, for simulation or historical data, cross-market arbitrage result shows that the total number of consecutive arbitrage opportunities in 5 minutes is larger than the total number of consecutive arbitrage opportunities in 10 minutes, followed by the total number of consecutive arbitrage opportunities in 15 minutes, and the total number of consecutive arbitrage opportunities in 20 minutes. In the end, when using the ETF 510300 as a spot in future-spot arbitrage, we find that when using margin way of arbitrage, whether it is based on historical data or analog data by Netlogo, there is always a higher overbound rate. There are more arbitrage opportunities than cross-market arbitrage. From the arbitrage direction, the number of reverse arbitrage opportunities in the future-spot arbitrage, the longest duration arbitrage time, the instantaneous arbitrage average earnings, and the continuous arbitrage opportunities is higher than the positive arbitrage, and it is similar with the cross-market arbitrage conclusions. For both real data and simulation data, the number of arbitrage opportunities continuing for 5 minutes is more than that for 10 minutes. Delaying 10 minutes’ arbitrage average return rate is higher than 5 minutes’ arbitrage. The reverse arbitrage times is more than the number of positive arbitrage. © 2020"

For each type of jumps, we examine their relation with portfolio flows (in the form of equity and bond flows, and carry trade activity), and dispersion in beliefs for the future exchange rate level and key macroeconomic variables. We find that inflows to both equity and bond markets, and increasing carry trade activity significantly reduce the size of jumps and (partially) their intensity.

Using a dataset of orders and trades from the French stock market, we investigate whether HFT algorithms constitute a source of systematic liquidity risk. We demonstrate that, across securities, the liquidity offered by high frequency traders is significantly less diverse than that of traditional traders; this finding is in line with the cross-asset learning hypothesis. The excessive co-movement in liquidity is also partly explained by common market making rules. In periods of increased market stress, we find HFT, designated market making, and order size to be important sources of liquidity commonality. Our results have policy implications for market regulators in Paris, suggesting the inclusion of maximum spread-limit rules in market making contracts will reduce the possibility of liquidity drying up when markets are in turmoil. © 2019 Elsevier Inc."

The price reversal phenomenon is gaining importance rapidly due to the increasingly intensive use of IT/Fintech-based trading automation facilities on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. However, one knows little about how their trading affects volatility and liquidity pressures that cause price reversals. A new research approach uses the factors of market microstructure mechanism based on high-frequency data (HFD-intraday). The research method uses purposive random sampling, which classified price fractions into three groups, specifically low price, medium price, and high price, which are analyzed by logistic panel regression. The research variables used include price reversal (dependent), stock return, trading volume, transaction frequency, volume/ frequency (V/F) proxy, volatility, and liquidity. According to low price model research findings, all variables show a significant effect on price reversal; for medium price model, all variables except liquidity show a significant effect on price reversal; and for high price model, all variables have a significant effect on price reversal, except trading volume and volatility. In conclusion, low price shares tend to have higher price reversal probability compared to continuity because they tend to be liquid, low institutional ownership, and minimal reporting/analysis and are controlled by HFTs (uninformed traders). Some variables are not significant because of the bounce effect around the bid-ask spread. © Perdana Wahyu Santosa, 2020."

In order to be first to trading opportunities, firms invest in the fastest hardware and the shortest connections between their machines and the markets. Yet this is not enough: algorithms must be short, no more than a few instructions. As a result there is a trade-off in the design of optimal high frequency trading strategies: being the fastest necessitates being less sophisticated. To understand the effect of this tension a computational model is presented that captures latency, both of code execution and information transmission. Trading algorithms are modelled through genetic programming with longer programmes allowing more sophisticated decisions at the cost of slower execution times. It is shown that, depending on the market composition, short fast strategies and slower more sophisticated strategies may both be viable and exploit different trading opportunities. The relative profits of these different approaches vary, however, slow traders benefit and social welfare increase in the presence of HFTs. A suite of regulations are tested to manage the risks associated with high frequency trading, the majority are found to be ineffective, though constraining the ratio of orders to trades may be promising. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."

The memory with short and long term is verified in two recurrence intervals by conditional probability density and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), which indicate that the recurrence intervals can be predicted.

The rigour manifested in the analysis of up to 412538 data points that bred from the choice of five different time intervals spanning from 1-minute to 120-minutes.

We examine each study in detail, from the selection of the dataset to the interpretation of the results. We also include empirical analyses to illustrate the shortcomings of certain approaches. There are three main findings from our review. First, the number of selected papers is very low, which is surprising even when the strict selection criteria are taken into account. Second, there are hardly any relevant studies that use high-frequency data—despite the hype about financial big data and machine learning. Third, the economic significance of the findings—for example, their usefulness for trading purposes—is questionable. In general, apparently good forecasting performance does not translate into profitability once realistic transaction costs and the effect of data snooping are taken into account.

Although some consider HFT to be inherently bad, others view it as providing important liquidity to markets. Thus, the question regarding HFT's impact on market quality remains open. To address this, the authors conducted two sets of controlled laboratory experiments, one with and one without an HFT robot trader. The authors focus on two aspects of HFT trading strategies that have the potential to affect market quality negatively: arbitrage and directional trading. Indeed the authors designed the HFT robot to have a perfect view of the market before executing a trade to provide it the best chance to influence the market. The introduction of this HFT robot had a significant positive impact on trading volume and bid depth, but it had a negligible impact on other market quality indicators such as efficiency, price volatility, bid-ask spread, and book depth. Thus, the authors find that in this polar case, HFT is neither a drain on nor a boost to market quality, suggesting that HFT trading, in its worst case, has a benign effect on the market.

Existing methods such as those based on realized volatility depend primarily on reducing the observed intra-day price fluctuations to simple scalar summaries. In this study, we propose several methods that incorporate full intra-day price information as functional data objects in order to forecast value at risk (VaR). Our methods are based on the recently proposed functional generalized autoregressive conditionally heteroscedastic (GARCH) models and a new functional linear quantile regression model. In addition to providing daily VaR forecasts, these methods can be used to forecast intra-day VaR curves, which we considered and studied with companion backtests to evaluate the quality of these intra-day risk measures. Using high-frequency trading data from equity and foreign exchange markets, we forecast the one-day-ahead daily and intra-day VaR with the proposed methods and various benchmark models. The empirical results suggested that the functional GARCH models estimated based on the overnight cumulative intra-day return curves exhibited competitive performance with benchmark models for daily risk management, and they produced valid intra-day VaR curves. © 2020 International Institute of Forecasters"

High-frequency trading is of particular interest. But, obtaining a high rate of return poses a lot of challenges. Many of these challenges can be overcome by algorithmic means. Genetic algorithms are an interesting class of algorithms for this kind of problem. Also, there is a growing body of literature that recognizes their importance. In this article we combined a genetic algorithm with a high-frequency trading perspective to consider bandwidth indicator application profitability. We used a simple genetic algorithm and develop an analytical model that examines the impact of different indicators on investment performance. We considered the following indicators: turnover rate, short-sale/margin ratio, bandwidth index and bid-ask ratio. Using these indicators, we select the highest-reward combination of stocks and the most appropriate trading frequency. Furthermore, we train and test the profit and loss performance of each stock group. Data for this study come from the Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation (TWSE). We found the return rate of the bandwidth index is significantly better than other indicators. Five-minute intervals delivered the best trading results. Additionally, the findings show that the volatility of the bandwidth indicator has a high impact on the volatility of the return rate in high-frequency trading.  © 2020 ACM."

These characteristics of stocks impede most forecasting models from extracting valuable information from stocks data. Herein, a novel hybrid deep learning model integrating attention mechanism, multi-layer perceptron, and bidirectional long-short term memory neural network is proposed. First, the raw data including four types of datasets (historical prices of stocks, technical indicators of stocks closing prices, natural resources prices, and historical data of the Google index) are transformed into a knowledge base with reduced dimensions using principal component analysis. Subsequently, multi-layer perceptron is used for the fast transformation of feature space and rapid gradient descent, bidirectional long-short term memory neural network for extracting temporal features of stock time series data, and attention mechanism for making the neural network focus more on crucial temporal information by assigning higher weights. Finally, a comprehensive model evaluation method is used to compare the proposed model with seven related baseline models. After extensive experiments, the proposed model demonstrated its good forecasting performance.  © 2013 IEEE."

However, little attention has been paid to extreme losses in a higher frequency intraday setting. This paper proposes a novel marked point process model to capture extreme risk in intraday returns, taking into account a range of trading activity and liquidity measures. A novel approach is proposed for defining the threshold upon which extreme events are identified taking into account the diurnal patterns in intraday trading activity. It is found that models including covariates, mainly relating to trading intensity and spreads offer the best in-sample fit, and prediction of extreme risk, in particular at higher quantiles. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

As the noisy nature of economic trends complicates predictions, especially in speculative assets, our approach does not predict courses but instead uses a reinforcement learning agent to learn an overall lucrative trading policy.

The strategy employs, in addition to sell limit orders (LOs) and sell market orders (MOs), a large number of spoof buy LOs to manipulate the volume imbalance of the LOB. Spoofing is illegal, so the strategy trades off the gains that originate from spoofing against the expected financial losses due to a fine imposed by the financial authorities. As the fine increases, the investor relies less on spoofing, and if the fine is large, the investor does not spoof the LOB. The arrival rate of buy MOs increases because other traders interpret the spoofed buy-heavy LOB as an upward pressure on prices. When the fine is low, spoofing considerably increases the revenues from liquidating a position. Spoofing increases the PnL because (i) the investor employs fewer MOs to draw the inventory to zero and benefits from roundtrip trades, which stem from spoof buy LOs that are ‘inadvertently’ filled and subsequently unwound with sell LOs; and (ii) the midprice trends upward when the book is buy-heavy; therefore the spoofer sells the asset at better prices. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Real-time trading of major USDA reports has substantially increased the frequency and clustering of price jumps, and results in higher market liquidity costs. In contrast, although the presence of jumps on non-announcement days has doubled recently, their magnitude has declined as have transactions costs during their occurrence.

We examined the effects of the incidents on prices by employing event study analysis and using both daily and intraday data. The results of the intra-daily analysis demonstrated that the attacks that occurred during trading hours had the greatest negative effects in the first 30 min. Thereafter, the market ensured recovery by compensating its loss until the end of the day. When the daily effects of the attacks were observed, it was found that only four of the thirty-five attacks caused significant negative impacts on the days they occurred. Moreover, in the aftermath, the 6- and 11-day cumulative abnormal returns were significantly negative in only one among these four attacks. Therefore, the case-by-case findings showed that the Borsa Istanbul equity market is resistant to major terrorist attacks.

HF quoting–quickly cancelling posted limit orders and replacing them with new ones–emerges as a strategy for liquidity-providing traders. HF quoting can generate noise in price quotes which adds uncertainty to order execution and impairs the informational value of bid and ask prices. It can also lead to the perception that markets cannot be trusted for commercial transactions. Using intraday Best Bid Offer data for 2008–2013 and wavelet-based measures of volatility, we investigate the excess variance and co-movement discrepancies in the bid and ask prices. We find excess HF quoting variance exists. It is the highest at 250-ms scale–90% higher than the variance implied by a random walk–but declines quickly to 7% at the 32 s scale. But its economic magnitude is negligibly small. Bid and ask price co-movements show a low degree of discrepancy with average correlations at 0.67 at 250 ms and reaching 0.95 at 8 s. All measures indicate that HF quoting noise has declined through the period. Overall, HF quoting has not caused excess variance during the transition to electronic trading in the liquid corn futures market. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Secondly, it takes high-frequency tick-by-tick data to explore the causal relationship between the ordering situation and the probability of informed trading and analyzes the impact of the event on the probability of informed trading. Finally, the dynamic factor analysis method is used to quantify the pricing efficiency based on the probability of informed trading and the characteristics of limit order book, and the influence of the event on the pricing efficiency of stock index futures market is discussed. The results show that the reduction of maximum order volume has different effects on dominant contracts and nondominant contracts of stock index futures. After the event, the overall trading volume of the market increased, where the trading volume of dominant contracts decreased and that of nondominant contracts increased. For dominant contracts, the depth, slope, and liquidity decrease, the spread increases, and the probability of informed trading decreases so that the pricing efficiency becomes worse, while the results of nondominant contracts are the opposite. For Chinese stock index futures market, the pricing efficiency is greatly reduced and the resource allocation capacity is weakened under the influence of the event. Therefore, the adjustment of maximum order volume is not conducive to the healthy development of the stock index futures market. It is suggested that the reduction of the maximum order volume is only implemented for nondominant contracts.  © 2020 Liang Wang et al."

Specifically, the algorithm efficiently determines the optimal non-linear mapping and the corresponding lead–lag structure between two time series. Afterwards, this study explores the use of optimal causal paths as a means for identifying promising stock pairs and for generating buy and sell signals. For this purpose, the established trading strategy exploits information about the leading stock to predict future returns of the following stock. The value-add of the proposed framework is assessed by benchmarking it with variants relying on classic similarity measures and a buy-and-hold investment in the S&P 500 index. In the empirical back-testing study, the trading algorithm generates statistically and economically significant returns of 54.98% p.a. and an annualized Sharpe ratio of 3.57 after transaction costs. Returns are well superior to the benchmark approaches and do not load on any common sources of systematic risk. The strategy outperforms in the context of cryptocurrencies even in recent times due to the fact that stock returns contain substantial information about the future bitcoin returns. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

This paper contains three objectives; first objective is to display the pattern of intraday market liquidity through commonly used measures. Second objective is to explain the concept of intraday market concentration and its pattern. Intraday market concentration is calculated by GINI index in order to examine the extent to which trading volume is characterised by small-sized homogeneous trade or small number of larger-sized trades. And the third objective is to empirically analyse the dimensions of intraday market liquidity, i.e., tightness, market depth, resiliency and trading time using different proxies. Empirical investigation explains that intraday market tightness and time dimension follow a GARCH and TARCH model while depth and resiliency dimension follow an ARCH and GARCH models. The proxies of each dimensions, i.e., bid-asks spread (tightness), and return volatility (resiliency) explains that market is less liquid, whereas trading volume (depth) and waiting time between subsequent trades (trading time) is showing the high liquidity in the market.

While it is intuitively obvious and straightforward to prove that in the presence of sufficiently high transaction costs, buy and hold is the better strategy, is it possible that with no transaction costs, buy and hold can still be the better strategy When there is no delay in trade execution, we prove a theorem saying that the answer is no.

HFT strategies have reached considerable volumes of commercial traffic, so much so that it is estimated that they are responsible for most of the transaction traffic of some stock exchanges, with percentages that, in some cases, exceed 70% of the total. One of the main issues of the HFT systems is the prediction of the medium-short term trend. For this reason, many algorithms have been proposed in literature. The author proposes in this work the use of an algorithm based both on supervised Deep Learning and on a Reinforcement Learning algorithm for forecasting the short-term trend in the currency FOREX (FOReign EXchange) market to maximize the return on investment in an HFT algorithm. With an average accuracy of about 85%, the proposed algorithm is able to predict the medium-short term trend of a currency cross based on the historical trend of this and by means of correlation data with other currency crosses using techniques known in the financial field with the term arbitrage. The final part of the proposed pipeline includes a grid trading engine which, based on the aforementioned trend predictions, will perform high frequency operations in order to maximize profit and minimize drawdown. The trading system has been validated over several financial years and on the EUR/USD cross confirming the high performance in terms of Return of Investment (98.23%) in addition to a reduced drawdown (15.97 %) which confirms its financial sustainability. © 2019 by the authors."

Therefore, how to select the learning features of the market based on rapidly changing financial data is particularly important. In this paper, the real time financial data are first processed by K-line theory, which uses candlesticks as a generalization of price movements over a period of time, so this process can play the role of de-noising. Then, the candlesticks are decomposed into different subparts by mean of a specified spatio-temporal relationship, based on which cluster analysis of the subparts to get the learning features. Further, the learning features that are clustered by the above K-lines are put into the model, and the online adaptive control of the parameters in the unknown environment is realized by the deep reinforcement learning method, so as to realize the high frequency transaction strategy. In order to verify the performance of the model, the data on different financial derivatives transactions such as stocks, financial futures and commodity futures are used. The proposal approach is compared with other methods which are based on price, fuzzified price and K-lines for features learning.

Our work uses high frequency data from the National Stock Exchange, India, for the year 2014. To begin, we analyse the spectrum of the correlation matrix to establish the presence of linear relations amongst the stock returns. A comparison of correlations with pairwise mutual information shows the further existence of non-linear relations which are not captured by correlation. We also see that the non-linear relations are more pronounced at the high frequency level in comparison to the daily returns used in earlier work. We provide two applications of this approach. First, we construct minimal spanning trees for the stock network based on mutual information and study their topology. The year 2014 saw the conduct of general elections in India and the data allows us to explore their impact on aspects of the network, such as the scale-free property and sectorial clusters. Second, having established the presence of non-linear relations, we would like to be able to exploit them. Previous authors have suggested that peripheral stocks in the network would make good proxies for the Markowitz portfolio but with a much smaller number of stocks. We show that peripheral stocks selected using mutual information perform significantly better than ones selected using correlation. © 2019 Sharma, Habib.

In Alsayed and McGroarty (2012) they are the first to demonstrate that arbitrage opportunities exist between stocks and their ADRs, through convergence pairs trading. Given that such arbitrage opportunities exist, we pose the question as to why such pair trades occur, rather than be eliminated by the law of one price? Using high frequency data over a 3 year sample period, with over 3.7 million 1-min observations, we investigate stock-ADR arbitrage pair trading. In this paper, we find pair trading returns exhibit substantial asymmetry in returns: pair trades involving ADR shorts (compared to stock shorts) have significantly less probability of loss, substantially higher returns but higher convergence risk. The asymmetric results are consistent with the market microstructure of ADR trading, specifically the sourcing of ADRs. Whilst long and short stocks can be easily sourced from the relevant markets, long and short ADR sourcing is less viable due to the market microstructure, but also, ADR's microstructure directly impacts the stock's price. We test our microstructure hypothesis further for robustness, with respect to specific investor types (such as retail traders), as well as during different market conditions (before, during and after the commencement of the global financial crisis), and find our results are consistent with our ADR microstructure hypothesis. This is also supported by CFD (contracts for difference) and ADR pairs trading results. Our results also confirm the results of Alsayed and McGroarty (2012) by conducting trades over a substantially longer and more varied trading period. Our results have implications for ADR markets, as well as market microstructures upon financial innovations such as exchange traded funds. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."

To achieve such a scheme, it is necessary to expand the sphere of activity of designated market makers, which is currentlywww.earticle.net limited to the nearest expiration contract of low-liquidity products and Korea Exchange (KRX) members. In-troducing a request for quote can replenish a liquidity trap in the market in which the provision of continuous quotes of the designated market maker has been occasionally interrupted. However, despite improve-ments, if market making schemes do not motivate designated market makers to improve liquidity and price efficiency, it may be difficult to materially improve the quality of a domestic derivatives market. Technological developments, which have made it possible to trade automatically using algorithms at ever-increasing speeds, have eroded the relative value of the privileges that designated market makers have traditionally enjoyed. Therefore, this study reconsiders the obligation of designated market makers in a high-frequency trading environment and examines the direction of improvements of detailed standards in market making schemes. The major conclusions drawn from the empirical results are summarized as follows. The behavior of designated market makers is more conservative than that of endogenous liquidity providers that supply liquidity as a profitable activity. Designated market makers may provide liquidity conservatively because current obligations and incentive schemes of market making motivate market makers to focus more on their quote obligation duty than on active trading profits. A detailed standard of contractual obligations can explain the specific passive behaviors of market makers for continuous quotes. Because committed quotation times are based on seconds for an average of 80 percent of the trading period, designated maker makers are hesitant to cancel orders after submitting them and tend to avoid submitting orders matched in less than 1 second. In contrast, high-frequency traders have a tendency to cancel many orders, and most of the trading volumes are matched in less than 1 second in high-frequency trading environments. Therefore, market makers’ potential responses to the increased challenges that they face are to ease their obligations in markets where high-frequency traders act as informed active traders or informal market makers, and to improve the benefits through market making compensation. This can be achieved by aligning and coordinating designated market makers’ obligations and benefits with the specific microstructural features of the market in which they operate. The incentives for the liquidity provider and the general requirements that need to be fulfilled to receive these incentives can be differentiated by a liquidity provider agreement. For example, market makers of the equity index options of Eurex can choose between three types of market making obligation schemes: regular market making, permanent market making and advanced market making. Regular market making focuses only on responses to quote requests by request for quote functionality, which allows market participants to request a one-or two-sided quote to the central order book of a specified instrument. Permanent market making consists of continuous quotation of a set of strikes for a predefined set of expirations and responses to quote requests for all strikes and expirations of a given product. The benefits and risks of implementingwww.earticle.net new fee structures in the presence of high frequency traders can be reviewed to attract higher frequency and other trading volume. The most common new fee structures use maker-taker fee models that charge asymmetric fees to participants who demand and supply liquidity. Markets offer a rebate to participants who supply liquidity and charge a fee to those who demand liquidity. However, these new fee structures have led to concerns that high-frequency traders are the prime beneficiaries of these fee rebates due to their ability to (almost) always place their orders at the top of the queue. © 2019, Korean Finance Association.

Economic applications include trading and nowadays particularly high frequency trading. Of outstanding importance are applications in insurance, where arrival times of successive claims are of vital importance. It turns out, however, that real data do not always support the genuine Poisson process. This has lead to variants and augmentations such as time dependent and varying intensities, for example. This paper investigates the fractional Poisson process. We introduce the process and elaborate its main characteristics. The exemplary application considered here is the Carmér–Lundberg theory and the Sparre Andersen model. The fractional regime leads to initial economic stress. On the other hand we demonstrate that the average capital required to recover a company after ruin does not change when switching to the fractional Poisson regime. We finally address particular risk measures, which allow simple evaluations in an environment governed by the fractional Poisson process. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Consequently, we develop a typology for various interpretations of algorithms as ethnographic objects, accounting for their structural ignorance and shedding light on a continuum of the changing human-machine/trader-algorithm relation. To this end, we use the concepts of ‘quasi-object’ and ‘quasi-subject’ as developed by Michel Serres, and make the point that in order to study financial algorithms ethnographically, we need to think anew the dynamic relationship they embody, and acknowledge their constitutive heterogeneity. © The Author(s) 2018."

This applies with particular force to securities regulation, in which regulators must constantly adapt to rapid financial innovation. In an era of high-frequency trading and unprecedented market connectivity, the SEC has struggled to apply its existing regulatory framework. Specifically, the Commission's tiered civil-penalty regime-a remnant of the 1990 Penny Stock Reform Act-is outdated and presents a number of challenges as applied to sophisticated trading violations. Primarily, the current structure, which allows Administrative Law Judges to punish financial misconduct for each illegal ""act or omission"" that has occurred, permits excessive discretion to impose monetary penalties and can result in varying penalty amounts. This lack of predictability introduces too much uncertainty into market behavior and also accelerates settlement rates, depriving industry members of valuable precedent. Punishing for each ""act or omission"" can also be an improper proxy for the severity of a particular offense, such as when a single act causes severe damage to market confidence. This Note argues that Congress should alter this outdated tier structure in favor of a gain-based penalty system, which would reduce variability and more accurately punish wrongdoing. © 2019 Samuel N.

In so doing, the study provides insights into the nature of market-moving information and the role of financial news flows in shaping market reactions in today’s high-frequency news and information environment. Design/methodology/approach: Using a multi-method case study approach, combining quantitative intraday event studies with a qualitative text analysis of financial online news and tweets by Elon Musk and Twitter, the authors shed light on the complex interaction between market events, financial information and stock market reactions. The analysis covers a period of four days, encompassing the announcement and introduction of the new battery pack for Model S and X by Tesla as well as the accompanying and follow-up reporting by the financial news media. Findings: Findings show that market reactions are driven by business events and expectations among the market rather than the follow-up reporting by financial news media. Financial online news instead seems to heavily rely on Elon Musk’s attention-triggering news to sustain its 24-h airtime with a variety of reporting tools, keeping the highly demanded audience engaged. Eventually, Twitter accounts of media visible companies and personalities, such as Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk, have been found to be useful market information sources for day traders and shareholders to trade at a profit. Originality/value: The study is a response to recent discussions about the legitimacy of Twitter communication by CEOs or representatives of listed companies. The findings show that Twitter communication needs to be well considered in light of strict market regulations (e.g. SEC in the USA) regarding insider-trading and the publication of market-relevant information. In addition, corporate financial communication should avoid impetuous communication via social media channels as this could have deterrent effects on the market valuation of a listed company. © 2019, Nadine Strauss and Christopher Holmes Smith."

Two main features distinguish the proposed approach from its alternatives. First, a shrinking horizon framework is implemented to update intraday parameters by incorporating new incoming information while maintaining standard nonanticipativity constraints. The method is data-driven, numerically tractable and reactive to the market. Second, lower partial moments, a downside risk measure, is used. Unlike symmetric measures, such as variance, this captures traders’ increased risk aversion to losses. The performance of the proposed strategies is tested using historical, high-frequency New York Stock Exchange data. All proposed strategies outperform classic strategies such as a time-weighted average price strategy as well as more unrealistic strategies such as an ex-post volume-weighted average price strategy that violates nonanticipativity on days with unfavorable market conditions; this strongly supports the use of lower partial moments as a risk measure.

In this paper, we propose and compare two Birnbaum–Saunders autoregressive conditional duration models specified in terms of time-varying conditional median and mean durations. These models provide a novel alternative to the existing autoregressive conditional duration models due to their flexibility and ease of estimation. Diagnostic tools are developed to allow goodness-of-fit assessment and to detect departures from assumptions, including the presence of outliers and influential cases. These diagnostic tools are based on the parameter estimates using residual analysis and the Cook distance for global influence, and different perturbation schemes for local influence. A thorough Monte Carlo study is presented to evaluate the performance of the maximum likelihood estimators, and the forecasting ability of the models is assessed using the traditional and density forecast evaluation techniques. The Monte Carlo study suggests that the parameter estimators are asymptotically unbiased, consistent and normally distributed. Finally, a full analysis of a real-world financial transaction data set, from the German DAX in 2016, is presented to illustrate the proposed approach and to compare the fitting and forecasting performances with existing models in the literature. One case related to the duration time is identified as potentially influential, but its removal does not change resulting inferences demonstrating the robustness of the proposed approach. Fitting and forecasting performances favor the proposed models and, in particular, the median-based approach gives additional protection against outliers, as expected. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

These new models take into account not only the common influence of endogenous factors and external information, but also the asymmetric effect of multi-information on high frequency volatility.

Focusing on the high frequency trading (HFT) industry, it analyses a series of interviews with HFT employees (managers, computer programmers and traders). It shows that regulations and firm rules profoundly affect HFT practices. However, they do not provide employees with answers for their ethical questions. To judge the ethicality of HFT, employees choose reference stakeholder groups and assess the way HFT impacts them. The perception that HFT has a positive effect on stakeholder groups is associated with moral satisfaction, whereas the perception that it has a negative effect is related to emotional detachment, sense of meaninglessness and turnover intent. The high variance in employees’ choices of stakeholder reference groups emphasizes the subjectivity and uncertainty that HFT ethicality entails. Therefore, this study suggests that the financial industry may lack moral leadership.

The first example is the probability of information-based trading (PIN) of Easley and O’Hara (1987). However, the structural model, PIN, has been criticized since the mid 2000s for not reflecting the data characteristics of the stock market, which has been turned into a surge of high frequency trading (HFT). Then, Duarte and Young (2009) proposed a modified PIN model, which extends the PIN model to overcome its shortcomings, and Odders-White and Ready (2008) suggested a model which is based on a fully different theoretical approach. This paper examines the validity of PIN, adjusted PIN (AdjPIN), and Odders-White and Ready (OWR), which have been extensively used as private information measures, in the Korean stock market. Applying them to the information asymmetry situation of the securities market before and after the merger announcement, we verify whether the estimates of these models are appropriate as private information measures. For this, we use the “Conditional Probability of an Information Event (CPIE)” of Duarte, Hu, and Young (2015, 2017). CPIE is estimated by model to enable to judge whether the private information reaches the market on a daily basis. The analyses in this paper include 29 cases of merger disclosures for the targeted companies listed on the KOSPI Market over an eight-and-a-half year period (2007. 5~2015. 10). We employ regression analysis, comparison between CPIE and its expected value, and the CPIE determinants analysis using the TAQ data for a total of 340 trading days before and after each event. As a result, only the OWR model among the three models appears to be useful as a measure of private information in the Korean securities market. Although there are differences in detail, this is essentially the same result as the US stock market. It suggests that in the Korea stock market, the OWR model based on orderflow imbalance, and day and over-night returns, is more appropriate as a measure of private information, rather than the PIN /AdjPIN model. The more detailed results are as follows. First, as a result of CPIE determinants analysis, the PIN-model-based CPIE is affected mostly by trade turnover and somewhat by order imbalance, while the AdjPIN-model-based CPIE is affected by trade turnover. Accordingly, the PIN/AdjPIN models are affected mainly by trade turnover, rather than order imbalance, on which they are theoretically based. On the other hand, most of the explanatory power of the OWR-model-based CPIE comes from over-night and intraday returns. The OWR-model-based CPIE reflects information consistent with its theoretical rationale, although it contrasts somewhat with the U.S. stock market, which is much more affected by either overnight return (in regression analysis) or intra-day return (in the comparison analysis between CPIE and its predicted value). Second, the PIN-/AdjPIN-model-based CPIEs are estimated at the boundary values 0 or 1 at least 81% of the time due to numerical overflow problems in the parameter estimation. This makes PIN or AdjPIN measurements more difficult to trust, even if the models are valid. Third, in all three models, the CPIE persists for up to 5~6 trading days after the announcement of the merger. However, after the announcement, the pattern shows a gradual decline to a lower level than before the announcement. Also, in all three models, the CPIE peaks one day after the announcement, rather than on the day of the announcement. This reflects a degree of inefficiency in the Korean stock market. Altogether, these results suggest that, among the PIN, AdjPIN, and OWR models, the OWR model best reflects the private information flow in the Korean stock market. In other words, they suggest that the OWR model based on order flow imbalance, over-night return, and intraday return, rather than the PIN/AjdPIN models based on order flow imbalance, is more appropriate as a measure of private information. The results on the Korean stock market are essentially the same as those of the U.S. stock market, though there are differences in detail, such as the relative importance of overnight and intraday returns. © 2019, Korean Finance Association.

Around these corporate events, information is revealed, and analyst estimates are confirmed or rejected. Conversely, share repurchase announcements happen less frequently and the timing of these announcements are unpredictable.

The EAEU meets challenges and creates legal and institutional framework for single financial services market within a relatively short timeframe. By 2025 both Supranational Eurasian financial regulator should be established and EAEU legislation on financial services should be harmonized. These tasks require international and national regulation experience. Therefore through the use of comparative analysis some advantages of the European Union law in the field of financial services market regulation are pointed out alongside with particular national legislation aspects of the EAEU member states in the similar or relative fields. Comparative analysis provides for determination of modern approaches to financial services market regulation in the EAEU and its member states, and allows to emphasize advantages and disadvantages of such regulation. Comparative analysis is applied to specifically investigate three subject areas of high relevance for global financial community: institutional forms of trade in financial instruments; organized trade in financial derivatives; organization of algorithmic and high-frequency algorithmic trading. Conclusion drawn is that the EU experience in the matters of financial markets regulation is of particular interest for the EAEU and its member states. © 2020, Supporting Academic Initiatives Foundation.

To tackle this problem, two completely opposite approaches, namely technical and fundamental analysis, emerged. Technical analysis bases its predictions on mathematical indicators constructed on the stocks price, while fundamental analysis exploits the information retrieved from news, profitability, and macroeconomic factors. The competition between these schools of thought has led to many interesting achievements, however, to date, no satisfactory solution has been found. Our work aims to combine both technical and fundamental analysis through the application of data science and machine learning techniques. In this paper, the stock market prediction problem is mapped in a classification task of time series data. Indicators of technical analysis and the sentiment of news articles are both exploited as input. The outcome is a robust predictive model able to forecast the trend of a portfolio composed by the twenty most capitalized companies listed in the NASDAQ100 index. As a proof of real effectiveness of our approach, we exploit the predictions to run a high frequency trading simulation reaching more than 80% of annualized return.

To address these concerns, researchers have employed a number of scientific data analysis tools to monitor the risk of such cascading events. As an example, the authors of this article investigate the natural gas (NG) futures market in the frequency domain and the interaction between weather forecasts and NG price data. They observe that Fourier components with high frequencies have become more prominent in recent years and are much stronger than could be expected from an analytical model of the market. Additionally, a significant amount of trading activity occurs in the first few seconds of every minute, which is a tell-tale sign of time-based algorithmic trading. To illustrate the potential of cascading events, the authors further study how weather forecasts drive NG prices and show that, after separating the time series by season to account for the different mechanisms that relate temperature to NG price, the temperature forecast is indeed cointegrated with NG price. They also show that the variations in temperature forecasts contribute to a significant percentage of the average daily price fluctuations, which confirms the possibility that a forecast error could significantly affect the price of NG futures. © 2019, With intelligence.

Design/methodology/approach: First, this study introduces a new model of price formation in a call auction with insider information. In this call auction model, insider trading gives rise to an asymmetric information component of transaction costs. Next, this study estimates the model using 20 stocks from Euronext Paris and investigates if the asymmetric information component is present. Findings: The theoretical analysis reveals that call auctions incorporate asymmetric information into prices. The empirical analysis finds strong evidence for the asymmetric information component. Testable implications provide further support for the model. Practical implications: Call auctions have recently been proposed as an alternative to continuous limit order book markets to overcome problems associated with high-frequency trading. However, it is still an open question whether call auctions efficiently aggregate asymmetric information. The findings of this study imply that call auctions facilitate price discovery and, therefore, are a viable alternative to continuous limit order book markets. Originality/value: There is no generally accepted measure of trading costs for call auctions. Therefore, the measure introduced in this study is of great value to anyone who wants to quantify trading costs in call auctions, understand the determinants of trading costs in call auctions or compare trading costs and their components between continuous markets and call auctions.

A market maker is in charge of adjusting prices (on a fast scale) and of setting closing prices and transaction costs on a daily basis, controlling for the volatility of returns and market activity. We first show that a baseline version of the model with no frictions is able to generate returns endowed with several stylized facts. This achievement suggests that the two time scales used in the model are one (possibly novel) way to obtain realistic market outcomes and that high-frequency trading can amplify liquidity shocks. We then explore whether transaction costs can be used to control excess volatility and improve market quality. While properly implemented taxation schemes may help in reducing volatility, care is needed to avoid excessively curbing activity in the market and intensifying the occurrence of abnormal peaks in returns. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

The theoretical part introduces a set of equations and presents an Agent Based Model implemented via a computer-based simulation. The wide spread leads to the appearance of unusual phenomena caused by the relative speed difference between the fast and slow traders. The latter agents tend to quote limit orders that look irrational, as they are distant more than one tick from the top-of-book. The same relative speed difference causes slow traders to post market orders that execute at price worse than originally intended. Both these abnormal orders tend to increase local volatility. Other results found by the simulation are an increase in global volatility (computed both as the difference of maximum less minimum price and as standard deviation of price distribution) and in volatility at sub-second timescales. These occurrences penalise slower traders and affect market stability. All the results are consistent both under quiet and stressed market conditions. The results found are then compared with audit trail data to verify the soundness of theory against practice. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."

The paper firstly reviews the development history of blockchain technology, and deeply explores the theory of blockchain technology. At the same time, based on an analysis of the distributed energy development, the paper summarizes some requirements for building a distributed energy trading market. Then, the distributed power trading mechanism and model are constructed with consideration of security constraints. Finally, a blockchain-based distributed power trading method is proposed to ensure the transparency and information symmetry of transactions, and the intelligent contracts for distributed power multilateral transactions are designed.

We discuss the predictability of the isolated system and open systems, respectively. Evidence from the analysis of the logistic map, Hénon map, and the Lorenz system manifests that the MED method is accurate, robust, and has a wide range of applications. We apply the new method to five-minute high-frequency data and the daily data of Chinese stock markets. Results show that the logarithmic change of stock price (logarithmic return) has a lower possibility of being predicted than the volatility. The logarithmic change of trading volume contributes significantly to the prediction of the logarithmic change of stock price on multiple time scales.

Special attention is paid to the potential asymmetries in the causal effects between oil and forex markets. The wavelet-based Granger causality method proposed by Olayeni (2016) is applied to quantify the causal relations in the time and frequency domains simultaneously. Moreover, the realized semivariance approach of Barndoff-Nielsen et al. (2010) is used to account for possible asymmetries in the transmission of volatility shocks. The empirical results show that the significant causal links between oil prices and exchange rates are mainly concentrated in the long-run and during periods of increased economic and financial uncertainty such as the global financial crisis and the subsequent European sovereign debt crisis. Further, the causal effects from currency markets to the crude oil market are stronger than in the opposite direction, consistent with the forward-looking nature of exchange rates, the role of the U.S. dollar as the key invoicing currency for global oil trading and the expanding financialization of the oil market since the mid-2000s. In addition, significant asymmetries coming from good and bad volatility are found at longer horizons. Specifically, bad volatility seems to dominate good volatility in terms of the importance of transmission of volatility shocks. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."

Our null hypothesis, commonly adopted in work on volatility modeling, is that volatility follows a stationary process combined with a constant time-of-day periodic component. We construct time-of-day volatility estimates and studentize the high-frequency returns with these periodic components. If the intraday periodicity is invariant, then the distribution of the studentized returns should be identical across the trading day. Consequently, the test compares the empirical characteristic function of the studentized returns across the trading day. The limit distribution of the test depends on the error in recovering volatility from discrete return data and the empirical process error associated with estimating volatility moments through their sample counterparts. Critical values are computed via easy-to-implement simulation. In an empirical application to S&P 500 index returns, we find strong evidence for variation in the intraday volatility pattern driven in part by the current level of volatility.

The bid-ask spread increases as the MRT increases because market makers (MMs) increase the depth of their LOs to protect them from being picked off by other traders. We also show that the expected profits of the MMs increase when the MRT increases. The intuition is as follows. As the MRT increases, there are two opposing forces at work. One, the longer the MRT, the more likely the LOs are to be filled and, on average, shares are sold at a loss. Two, because the depth of the posted LOs increases, the probability that the LO is picked off by other traders before the end of the MRT decreases. The net effect is that a longer MRT leads to a higher expected profit. We also show that the depth of LOs increases when the volatility of the price of the asset increases. Also, the depth of LOs increases when the arrival rate of market orders increases because it is less likely that LOs will be picked off by the end of the MRT. Finally, our model also makes predictions about the overall liquidity of the market. We show that MMs choose to supply the minimum amount of shares per LO allowed by the exchange because expected profits are maximised when liquidity provided is lowest. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

At times of increasing order toxicity, however, HFTs may withdraw liquidity due to higher probability of adverse selection.

In this study, a novel hybrid model with the strength of fractional order derivative is presented with their dynamical features of deep learning, long-short term memory (LSTM) networks, to predict the abrupt stochastic variation of the financial market. Stock market prices are dynamic, highly sensitive, nonlinear and chaotic. There are different techniques for forecast prices in the time-variant domain and due to variability and uncertain behavior in stock prices, traditional methods, such as data mining, statistical approaches, and non-deep neural networks models are not suited for prediction and generalized forecasting stock prices. While autoregressive fractional integrated moving average (ARFIMA) model provides a flexible tool for classes of long-memory models. The advancement of machine learning-based deep non-linear modelling confirms that the hybrid model efficiently extracts profound features and model non-linear functions. LSTM networks are a special kind of recurrent neural network (RNN) that map sequences of input observations to output observations with capabilities of long-term dependencies. A novel ARFIMA-LSTM hybrid recurrent network is presented in which ARFIMA model-based filters having the linear tendencies better than ARIMA model in the data and passes the residual to the LSTM model that captures nonlinearity in the residual values with the help of exogenous dependent variables. The model not only minimizes the volatility problem but also overcome the over fitting problem of neural networks. The model is evaluated using PSX company data of the stock market based on RMSE, MSE and MAPE along with a comparison of ARIMA, LSTM model and generalized regression radial basis neural network (GRNN) ensemble method independently. The forecasting performance indicates the effectiveness of the proposed AFRIMA-LSTM hybrid model to improve around 80% accuracy on RMSE as compared to traditional forecasting counterparts. © 2013 IEEE."

This has produced highly competitive and fragmented financial markets. It is in this market environment that the ultra-fast segment of high-frequency trading (HFT) has materialised. European regulators have addressed the potential adverse market impact of HFT in terms of increased systemic risk (e.g. 'flash crashes') and market abuse through provisions in MiFID II and in the MAR. But there is also an additional concern that so far has received less regulatory attention-the question of whether HFT is fair. This article explores whether and how HFT raises fairness-related concerns against the backdrop of the overarching policy goal of maintaining confidence in the financial markets. Finding that HFT does indeed raise such concerns, it then asks whether the newly instituted provisions on algorithmic trading and HFT in MiFID II and MAR do anything to alleviate this problem. The answer is to a certain extent yes. However, significant concerns remain unaddressed by the new regulatory context. The article suggests other provisions in MiFID II that in the author's view should be assessed with a view to target fairness-related concerns raised by HFT. © 2020 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands."

The findings show that market efficiency is significantly related to certain variables for individual stocks, such as return volatility, trading volume, closing price, and trading costs. Furthermore, one specific characteristic of the Chinese stock market, prevalent speculative trading, causes these relations to differ from those in the US stock market. The stocks with high return volatility and high price level are more efficiently priced in short horizons because they have an elevated level of speculative trading, which gradually loses its effect on market efficiency in the Chinese stock market after 15–20 min. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

The main idea is to introduce special encoding schemes on the observed prices in order to obtain an efficient estimation of the forward conditional probability distribution performed by a feedforward neural network. Based on these estimations, a trading signal is launched if the probability of price change becomes significant which is measured by a quadratic criterion. The performance analysis of our method tested on historical time series (NASDAQ/NYSE stocks) has demonstrated that the algorithm is profitable.

This gives us important insights into a class of market participant who has come to be very influential in present markets. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use the weekly natural gas (NG) storage report for the test because the information contained in the release often has a large effect on prices. Moreover, the NG market is heavily traded and liquid, and prone to high volatility. These factors make trading in this market attractive to HFT. The authors test for the profitability of those who trade in the first milliseconds after the report’s release; and for information leakage prior to the report. Findings: The authors find those who trade within the first 50 ms accurately incorporate the information contained in the storage report into prices, and earn the majority of profits. In fact, HFT profits are decreasing in the time it takes them to trade after the announcement (measured to 200 ms). Further tests find no evidence of informed trading prior to the release of the report, and so the HFT reaction to the report incorporates the information contained therein into prices.

In this paper, we utilise algorithms for detecting turnings points to identify both bull and bear phases in high-frequency markets for the three largest cryptocurrencies of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. We also examine the market efficiency and liquidity of the selected cryptocurrencies during these periods using high-frequency data. Our findings show that the hourly returns of the three cryptocurrencies during a bull market indicate market efficiency when using the detrended-fluctuation-analysis (DFA) method to analyse the Hurst exponent with a rolling window. However, when conditions turn and there is a bear-market period, we see signs of a more inefficient market. Furthermore, our results indicated differences between the cryptocurrencies in terms of their liquidity during the two market states. Moving from a bull to a bear market, Ethereum and Litecoin appear to become more illiquid, as opposed to Bitcoin, which appears to become more liquid. The motivation to study the high-frequency cryptocurrency market came from the increasing availability of higher-frequency cryptocurrency-pricing data. However, it also comes from a movement towards higher-frequency trading of cryptocurrency. In addition, the efficiency of cryptocurrency markets relates not only to whether prices are predictable and arbitrage opportunities exist, but, more widely, to topics such as testing the profitability of trading strategies and determining the maturity of cryptocurrency markets. © 2020 by the authors."

The increase in liquidity comovement is consistent with HFT liquidity providers being better able to monitor other stocks and adjust their liquidity provision accordingly.

The new method uses quantization and volatility information together with feedforward neural networks for achieving high-frequency trading (HFT). The proposed procedures are based on estimating the Forward Conditional Probability Distribution (FCPD) of the quantized return values. From past samples, the conditional expected value can be learned, from which FCPD can be obtained by using a special encoding scheme. Based on this estimation, a trading signal is triggered if the probability of price change becomes significant as measured by a quadratic criterion. Due to the encoding scheme and quantization, the complexity of learning and estimation has been reduced for HFT. Extensive numerical analysis has been performed on financial time series and the new method has proven to be profitable on mid-prices.

This article identifies both the magnitude and the duration of the bias caused by market microstructure noise in measuring efficient price variance in the live cattle futures market from 2011 to 2016, with emphasis on price variance behavior in recent years. Market microstructure noise increases observed price variance, but its effects are not large and do not last more than three to four minutes in response to changing information. Intraday price variance has increased in recent years, but the findings provide little evidence that high frequency traders were responsible for economically meaningful market noise. Informatively, steps taken by the CME and cattle producers to mitigate noise have not been fruitful to date, and signal that the magnitude of noise will likely vary with the magnitude of changes in demand and cyclical supply. © The Author(s) 2018.

We show how the agent replicates the payoff of the claim and also speculates in the asset to maximize expected utility of terminal wealth. In the strategy, MOs are used to keep the inventory on target, to replicate the payoff, and LOs are employed to build the inventory at favorable prices and boost expected terminal wealth by executing roundtrip trades that earn the spread.

Here, the advertisements of turtles for sale in Vietnamese Facebook groups were monitored for the period 2013-2018, obtaining a total of 481 advertisement cases concerning 5,758 individuals belonging to 53 species and 12 families. There has been a rapidly rising trade of turtles online, especially in the last two years. Many traded species were allochthonous, but native species accounted for 22 species and over 36 % of the traded individuals. Most allochthonous species were traded as hatchlings and juveniles, whereas most of the native species were traded as subadults and adults, thus suggesting a high frequency of illegal trade in wild caught animals. Five traded native species are considered among the 50 most threatened turtle species in the world. Turtle trade occurred mostly in the two biggest cites of Vietnam (Ho Chi Minh city and Hanoi), which accounted for 68 % of the total trade.

It focuses on the UK regime. The insights derived are envisaged to be helpful guides for participants and regulators in financial markets. Design/methodology/approach: This paper used the legal-economics perspective. It relied on primary data from statutes and regulations and secondary data from the public domain to analyze the phenomenon. The analytical framework comprised the following sections: Introduction, MiFID I review, MiFID II scope, MiFID II key concerns and concluding remarks. Findings: Only half of the EU Member States including the UK managed to transpose MiFID II within the 3rd January 2018 effective date. At this early stage of implementation, various teething problems were encountered. These pertained to costs and charges reporting, firm governance, product governance, transaction reporting, best execution and research. Owing to the sheer scale and complexity of MIFID II, most entities barely coped with their reporting obligations. Noting the situation, the Financial Conduct Authority assured firms taking all sufficient steps that they would be treated fairly. Research limitations/implications: The paper was not sufficiently empirical. However, the study benefited reasonably from triangulation of data and perspectives to provide good insights on the implementation effects of the complex and voluminous EU rules for governing financial markets with global implications. Practical implications: Investors could gain from the enhanced transparency and best execution rules. Investment banks could gain from the emerging resilient, integrated and efficient financial markets. Regulators with better access to more and higher quality reporting could intervene more effectively when required. Originality/value: This paper assembled and critically analyzed currently available research insights in these areas so as to provide useful guidance to those needing to work and comply with MiFID II rules and academics teaching financial services law. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited."

In this paper, we apply higher-order Factorization Machines, for which efficient training algorithms have only been available since 2016. As Factorization Machines require hyperparameters to be specified, we also introduce a novel adaptive-order algorithm for automatically determining them. Our study is the first one to make use of social media data for predicting minute-by-minute stock returns, namely the ones of the S&P 500 stock constituents. We show that, unlike a trading strategy employing support vector machines, Factorization-Machine-based strategies attain positive returns after transactions costs for the years 2014 and 2015.

Regulators claim limits curb volatility, allay stressed markets, and encourage reflection on information to trade rationally. Opponents contend saying limits delay the inevitable by postponing volatility, deferring equilibrium price discovery, and obtrude investors’ trading plans. While these undesired effects are all ex-post in nature, some argue that limits–by very existence–threaten to invite trading activities towards themselves and govern trade-flow such that the limit’s prophecy is fulfilled. This is known as magnet effect. Theoretical development of this ex-ante effect has been in hibernation since the 1990s. Thus, empirical attempts have been made to test its existence–mostly in East-Asian exchanges with tight limits. Bursa Malaysia, however, defends its ±30% limit for ~30 years based on internal (unpublished) studies. This paper employs a battery of tests to examine the existence and magnitude of magnet effect and–its counterpart–repellent effect in Malaysia. Our findings suggest a weak form of magnet effect and comparable degrees of repellent effect.

This analysis highlights that the effects of HFT on market liquidity, trading strategies and speed, implications for market structure changes, and the relationship between the “scriptability” of corporate disclosure and HFT short-term information advantage, are key themes. The analysis also suggests that many open questions remain unanswered including more recent HFT trading strategies and complex techniques applied to analyse the content of both voluntary and mandatory corporate disclosure.

To this end, this paper mainly proposes a distributed power trading method based on blockchain considering security constraints. The paper first reviews the development history of blockchain technology, and explores the theory of blockchain technology. At the same time, it combines the analysis of distributed energy features and summarizes some requirements for building a distributed energy trading market. Then the mechanism and model of distributed power trading considering security constraints are constructed. Finally, a distributed power trading method based on blockchain is proposed to ensure the transparency of transactions, and to provide smart contracts for distributed power multilateral transactions.

This is a major issue, as trading speed overwhelming the capability of the server to cope with the incoming orders might jeopardise the orderly functioning of the markets. It will be shown how, by raising the speed of trading and increasing the number of the agents operating in the market, it is possible to generate a crisis, no matter how performing the exchange server is. The paper presents a theoretical framework and then verifies its occurrence by analysing audit trail data. The theoretical framework shows a scenario in which under certain, heavy but by no means uncommon, conditions, the excess speed of the trading agents with respect to servers is capable of exacerbating price volatility, leading to vicious feedback loops capable of potentially creating a financial crisis. The empirical part analyses data taken from a particularly volatile day and compares them with much less volatile days. It results that, because of excessive speed, one of the most widely used techniques for minimising risk, order churning, can cause a major crisis. © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

We assume that brokers are risk-neutral and they quote spreads so that losses to latency arbitrageurs are recovered from other traders in the FX market. These losses are reduced if the broker can reject, ex-post, loss-making trades by enforcing the Last Look option which is a feature of some trading venues in FX markets. For a given rejection threshold the risk-neutral broker quotes a spread to the market so that her expected profits are zero. When there is only one venue, we find that the Last Look option reduces quoted spreads. If there are two venues we show that the market reaches an equilibrium where traders have no incentive to migrate. The equilibrium can be reached with both venues coexisting, or with only one venue surviving. Moreover, when one venue enforces Last Look and the other one does not, counterintuitively, it may be the case that the Last Look venue quotes larger spreads. © 2018, The Author(s)."

Building a model that expresses the trading behaviors of the different types of players and the price actions in turmoil is important to set regulations to maintain fair markets. Firstly, we represent trading behaviors of the three types of players, algorithmic traders, general traders, and market makers as well as the mid price process of a risky asset by a linear quadratic stochastic differential game. Secondly, we obtain a Nash equilibrium by solving a forward–backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE) derived from the stochastic maximum principle. Finally, we present numerical examples of the Nash equilibrium and the corresponding price action of the risky asset, which agree with the empirical findings on trading behaviors of players in high frequency markets.

This suggests that the possible causative agent(s), including genetic factors such as HLA-B51, might have had spread along this route. Seven cross-sectional and population-based field studies showed that the prevalence of BS was between 19 and 421 among 100, 000 adolescent/adult population in Turkey. The lower three frequencies (19, 20, and 80/105) come from Thrace, the European part. The disease is less common in Western Europe, the USA, and in the rest of the world but perhaps not as rare as it had previously been thought. A recent study showed that BS was as frequent (7.1/105) as other vasculitic diseases - 9/105 for the combination of polyarteritis nodosa, microscopic polyangiitis, Wegener’s granulomatosis, and Churg-Strauss syndrome - in a suburb of Paris, France. This chapter focuses on the epidemiological features of the field surveys of BS in Turkey and the rest of the globe as well as regional differences in some of the clinical and laboratory features. Gastrointestinal disease is frequent in patients from the Far East (especially Japan), while it is rather infrequent among those from Turkey. Moreover, a high frequency of both pathergy test positivity and being a carrier of HLA-B5 (51) is observed in patients from Japan and the Mediterranean countries, in contrast to the patients from the UK and the USA. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020."

Moreover, we derive an explicit singular optimal strategy for the special case of an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck signal and an exponentially decaying transient market impact. The combination of a mean-reverting signal along with a market impact decay is of special interest, since they affect the short term price variations in opposite directions. Later, we show that in the asymptotic limit where the transient market impact becomes instantaneous, the optimal strategy becomes continuous. This result is compatible with the optimal trading framework which was proposed by Cartea and Jaimungal (Appl. Math. Finance 20:512–547, 2013).

Monte-Carlo simulations reveal that HFT-targeted policies imply a trade-off between market stability and resilience.

Moreover, the asymmetry of volatility–volume relationship is investigated. The results show that there is strong positive correlation between volatility and trading volume when realized volatility and its continuous component are considered. The relationship between trading volume and discontinuous jump component is ambiguous. The expected and unexpected trading volumes have positive influence on volatility. Furthermore, the unexpected trading volume, which is caused by arrival of new information, has a larger influence on price volatility. The findings also show that an asymmetric volatility–volume relationship indeed exists, which can be interpreted by the fact that trading volume has more explanatory power in positive realized semi-variance than negative realized semi-variance.

This paper proposes a multi-scale combined forecast method for carbon price based on manifold learning of unstructured data. Firstly, the unstructured data related to carbon price is extracted using the network search index, and dimensionality reduction is performed based on the isometric mapping manifold learning. Then, the structured data of other influencing factors and the carbon trading price are decomposed into a variable number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) respectively. The IMF is reconstructed to get high frequency sequence, low frequency sequence and trend item based on the fine-to-coarse method. Moreover, autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA), Partial least squares (PLS) regression and neural network are used to forecast high-frequency data, low-frequency data and trend items, which are aggregated to get the final forecast result.

Although intraday returns have attracted much attention in recent years, handling these data is challenging because of their unique characteristics. When dealing with ultra-high frequency or tick-by-tick observations the enormous amount of data needs to be processed prior to estimation of integrated variance for two reasons: eliminating microstructure noise and finding appropriate unbiased estimator. This paper contributes to the existing literature in a two ways. First, we propose how to handle quality issues of the high frequency data due to non-frequent trading and lower liquidity of emerging markets. Second, we find the optimal sampling frequency at slow time scale that should be used to obtain two-time scale estimator of integrated variance for each emerging market under consideration: Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria and Croatia. Empirical results indicate that intraday returns should be sampled every 7 to 10 minutes at slow time scale while the fast time scale should be fixed at the highest possible frequency. Realized variance estimator at the fast time scale mostly overestimates the integrated variance on all stock markets except Bulgaria; on average between 70% and 90% of the time. Moreover, the robustness of the results with respect to the price jumps has been verified for Romania and Hungary, unlike Croatia and Bulgaria, for which we recommend a robust version of two-time scale estimator of integrated variance within truncation technique. It is additionally found that intraday returns should be sampled more frequently in a highly volatile periods. These findings offer valuable information to market participants, as they are able to apply the most accurate ex-post volatility measure, as unbiased and consistent estimate of integrated variance. © 2019, UNIVRIJEKA.

So far, there have been very limited attempts for extracting relevant features based on the limit order book data. In this paper, we address this problem by designing a new set of handcrafted features and performing an extensive experimental evaluation on both liquid and illiquid stocks. More specifically, we present an extensive set of econometric features that capture the statistical properties of the underlying securities for the task of mid-price prediction. The experimental evaluation consists of a head-to-head comparison with other handcrafted features from the literature and with features extracted from a long short-term memory autoencoder by means of a fully automated process. Moreover, we develop a new experimental protocol for online learning that treats the task above as a multi-objective optimization problem and predicts: 1) the direction of the next price movement and; 2) the number of order book events that occur until the change takes place. In order to predict the mid-price movement, features are fed into nine different deep learning models based on multi-layer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks, and long short-term memory neural networks. The performance of the proposed method is then evaluated on liquid and illiquid stocks (i.e., TotalView-ITCH US and Nordic stocks). For some stocks, results suggest that the correct choice of a feature set and a model can lead to the successful prediction of how long it takes to have a stock price movement. © 2019 IEEE."

We find that the vote causes an increase in the correlation among the safe-haven currencies of the Swiss franc and Japanese yen as well as gold, and also find a decrease in their correlation with the directly involved currencies of British sterling and the Euro. These changes are due to the appreciation of the former group and the depreciation of the latter group which represents a flight to quality of investors. We also observe a substantial decrease in volatility transmission between British sterling and the Euro following the Brexit vote due to lower levels of market integration. However the volatility transmission among the currencies has increased in general and their net spillover is positively correlated with their level of volatility and trading activities. Therefore we document the significant impact of the politically important Brexit vote on the high frequency correlation and volatility spillover in the foreign exchange market. © 2018 Elsevier B.V."

To allow for different effects on the propagation mechanism of uncertainty shocks, we apply a time-varying Bayesian VAR approach.

Using order-level data from the National Stock Exchange of India, we find that proprietary algorithmic traders increase limit order supply following periods of both high short-term stock-specific volatility and extreme stock price movement. Even following periods of high marketwide volatility, they do not decrease their supply of liquidity. We define orders from high-frequency traders as a subclass of orders from proprietary algorithmic traders that are revised in less than three milliseconds. The behavior of high-frequency trading mimics the behavior of its parent class. This is inconsistent with the theory that fast traders leave the market when stress situations arise, although their limit-order-supplying behavior becomes weaker when the increase in short-term volatility is more informational than transitory. Agency algorithmic traders and nonalgorithmic traders behave opposite to proprietary algorithmic traders by reducing the supply of liquidity during stress situations. The presence of faster traders in the market possibly instills the fear of adverse selection in them. We document that the order imbalance of agency algorithmic traders is positively related to future short-term returns, whereas the order imbalance of proprietary algorithmic traders is negatively related to future short-term returns. © 2018 Financial Management Association International"

Approximate computing is a promising solution to accelerate computation by trading off energy and accuracy. In this paper, we propose a resistive content addressable memory (CAM) accelerator, called RCA, which exploits data locality to have an approximate memory-based computation. RCA stores high frequency patterns and performs computation inside CAM without using processing cores. During execution time, RCA searches an input operand among all prestored values on a CAM and returns the row with the nearest distance. To manage accuracy, we use a distance metric which considers the impact of each bit indices on computation accuracy. We evaluate an application of proposed RCA on CPU approximation, where RCA can be used as a stand-alone or as a hybrid computing unit besides CPU cores for tunable CPU approximation. We evaluate the architecture of the proposed RCA using HSPICE and multi2sim by testing our results on x86 CPU processor. Our evaluation shows that RCA can accelerate CPU computation by 12.6× and improve the energy efficiency by 6.6× as compared to a traditional CPU architecture, while providing acceptable quality of service. © 2013 IEEE."

The market microstructure approach focuses on analysis of market frictions impacting on how new equilibriums are being come upon. Market frictions exist due to fragmented market structure and information asymmetries. Respectively, the article (Part 1) compares ""market microstructure"" and ""market structure""; reveals drivers of spatial and temporal fragmentation (including breakdown of modern trading protocols and participation models); analyzes information (self-)learning of market and adverse selection; makes distinctions between ""market quality"", ""market efficiency"" and ""market liquidity""; and traces how the market efficiency and equilibrium concepts were evolving when market frictions drew attention. How the market microstructure approach may work is demonstrated in the course of a high-frequency trading (HFT) case study in Part 2 of the article. HFT has brought new evidence that market structure matters-both as an environment where tech innovations are only possible and as mechanisms to be adjusted to new challenges-and has outlined directions for further elaborations on basic microstructural concepts.

In this paper, the power-law distribution that the Bitcoin network obeys is given, while traditional de-anonymous methods such as clustering fail to satisfy it. Therefore, considering the profit-oriented characteristics of Bitcoin traders in such occasion, we put forward a deanonymous heuristic approach that recognizes and analyzes the behavioral patterns of financial High-Frequency Transactions(HFT), with real-time exchange rate of Bitcoin involved. Basing on the heuristic approach, finally we established the de-anonymous method that matches the activity information of the IP with the transaction records in blockchain.

High levels of order flow toxicity can culminate in market makers providing liquidity at a loss or in the suboptimal execution of trades. From a regulatory perspective, high levels of toxicity can be harmful to overall market liquidity and precede precipitous drops in asset prices. The bulk volume-volume-synchronized probability of informed trading (BV-VPIN) model is one way of measuring the “toxicity” component of order flow, and it has been successfully applied in high-frequency trading environments. We apply the BV-VPIN to daily data from a range of international indexes in order to extend previous analyses of its properties.We find that a rise in BV-VPIN effectively foreshadows high levels of volatility in the equity indexes of several countries. If a BV-VPIN futures contract were to exist, we show that it would exhibit safe haven characteristics during market downturns.

Firstly, there is evidence of the presence of informed trading through persistent effects of trade size for both purchases and sales. The magnitude of effects and the seasonality of informed trading vary among varieties, which support the importance of night trading for price smoothing. Secondly, the impact of liquidity costs on returns does not permanently persist. For example, there appears a significant Friday effect with a linear negative relationship in the soybean market, while an exact opposite effect can be found in the corn market for Monday. Thirdly, while the results show no effect of holding position on asset returns in the corn market, the market size of soybean futures exerts a positive Thursday effect, which is prior to the Friday effect of transaction cost.

Therefore, the drivers of carbon prices need to be disentangled to analyze the price formation process, which is important for both policy makers and investors. By applying the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) method, we decompose the historical carbon price data of the five ETS pilots in China into five groups of the independent Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) sequences and the residue, respectively. Then, the IMFs and the residue in each pilot are reconstructed into a high frequency component, a low frequency component and a trend component, thus disentangling the effects of short-term market fluctuations, significant events, and the long-term trend. The main findings are as follows. First, the IMF with a period around one year is the most influential factor, which reflects that pilots are characterized by the yearly cycle. Second, significant events have greater impacts than short-term market fluctuations, and are the dominant driver in Shanghai and Beijing pilots. Third, the long-term trend plays a decisive role in Shenzhen, Guangdong and Hubei pilots.

In the literature, it has been long assumed that informed investors rely solely on market orders. Theoretical modeling of order choice under conditions of information asymmetry has been widely perceived to be complicated so far. Few empirical studies have been done on this subject, and even fewer have considered non-high-frequency data, primarily because detailed order and transaction data are rarely available. This builds on the implications of several studies, and this article www.earticle.net tests the hypothesis that investors with long-term private information prefer limit orders. When investors have information that is unlikely to spread among other market participants in the near future, the execution risk is low. In that case, the investors would wait discreetly for their limit orders to be executed at hopefully favorable prices and avoid influencing the market price, rather than rushing to take trading opportunities at a premium by placing market orders. As investors have information, the risk of adverse selection problem also remains low. To test this hypothesis, I investigate the trading practices of domestic institutional and individual investors. Compared with individual investors, institutional investors have been widely assumed to be better informed about future stock returns, at least for the intermediate-term of under a year. As institutional investors manage larger funds, they are more likely to spend resources to produce long-lived private information, and are concerned about the possibility of impacting prices. Individual investors are not usually considered to have superior information, but some evidences support their ability to predict future returns. In my simple preliminary analysis, I find that institutional investors are commonly able to predict the future returns for large stocks, and individual investors are often able to predict the future returns for small stocks. To provide empirical evidence regarding the aforementioned hypothesis, I use a unique dataset that includes every order and transaction of equity shares on the Korean Stock Exchange between January of 1999 and August 2009. I find that institutional investors make significantly more limit orders in purchasing (selling) stocks whose ex-post four-week returns are in the highest (lowest) quintile, and that they also return to use more limit orders after prices start to rise (fall) rapidly along with the general increase in market orders. In addition, according to our Fama-MacBeth (1973) cross-sectional regressions similar to those of Kelley and Tetlock (2013), institutional investors’ limit order imbalance positively predicts the following 4-to 12-week returns. In particular, the institutional investors’ return predictability on the biggest 30% stocks in particular is significant, both statistically and economically. These predictions do not reverse until 52 weeks later. These findings are robust when the order imbalances of individual and foreign investors are included as additional explanatory variables. The market order imbalances of institutional investors generally do not predict future returns. Concerning individual investors, no evidence is found that they use more limit orders when purchasing the stocks whose ex-post four-week returns are in the highest quintile. These investors use more limit orders in selling ex-post loser stocks, but the insignificant predictability of their negative limit order imbalances for predict future returns suggests that this increase in limit orders is unrelated to having private information. During the upward (downward) price movements, individual investors only tend to increase their market orders steadily for purchasing (selling) those winner (loser) stocks. Thus, on average, individual investors seem to be no better informed than the market as a whole. However, the limit order imbalances of individual investors strongly predict the 4-to 52-week returns on small stocks, especially when these limit order imbalances are positive. These overall results of individual investors can be compatible if a small number of individual investors do hold superior information on small-cap stocks, whereas it is more difficult for average investors to acquire information on these stocks, due to their deeper information asymmetry. In general, the market order imbalances of individual investorswww.earticle.net do not predict these stocks’ future returns. In summary, institutional investors prefer limit orders when they trade on the basis of private information on large stocks, and individual investors prefer limit orders when they trade small stocks on the basis of positive private information. Only a small fraction of the institutional investors and a smaller fraction of the individual investors seem to acquire high-quality long-lived information before prices fully converge to the reservation prices. My findings suggest that in some situations, investors can take profits due to having superior information. Such information can remain unrevealed to the public for longer periods than has been previously assumed according to efficient market theory. This article contributes to the discussion of order choice problems under information asymmetry. My findings can also help to reconcile the inconsistencies that domestic institutional and individual investors’ predictions on future returns show mixed results. © 2019, Korean Finance Association.

More investors put their effort to the development of a systematic approach, i.e., the so called ""Trading System (TS)"" for stocks pricing and trend prediction. The introduction of the Trading On-Line (TOL) has significantly improved the overall number of daily transactions on the stock market with the consequent increasing of the market complexity and liquidity. One of the most main consequence of the TOL is the ""automatic trading"", i.e., an ad-hoc algorithmic robot able to automatically analyze a lot of financial data with target to open/close several trading operations in such reduced time for increasing the profitability of the trading system. When the number of such automatic operations increase significantly, the trading approach is known as High Frequency Trading (HFT). In this context, recently, the usage of machine learning has improved the robustness of the trading systems including HFT sector. The authors propose an innovative approach based on usage of ad-hoc machine learning approach, starting from historical data analysis, is able to perform careful stock price prediction.

The intraday momentum findings are not only theoretically explained by the trading behavior of infrequent rebalancing or late-informed investors, but also consistent with the empirical evidence of a U-shaped volume pattern and significantly more useful information contained in the first and seventh half-hour returns.

The output from the evolved strategies is a rebalancing signal which is conditioned upon a range of dynamic non-linear factors related to market conditions including liquidity and volatility. When this signal exceeds threshold values during the trading day, the hedge position is rebalanced. The performance of the GP-evolved strategy is evaluated against a number of commonly used, time-based, deterministic hedging strategies where the hedge position is rebalanced at fixed time intervals ranging from 5 min to 1 day. Assuming the delta hedger pays the bid-ask spread on the futures contract whenever the portfolio is rebalanced, this study finds that the GP-evolved hedging strategy out-performs standard, deterministic, time-based approaches. Empirical analysis shows that the superior performance of the GP strategy is driven by its ability to account for non-linear intra-day persistence in high frequency measures of liquidity and volatility.

The effort in developing formal verification methods is justified considering the large code-base, the complexity in synchronization required in a monolithic kernel and the support for multiple architectures, along with the usage of Linux on critical systems, from high-frequency trading to self-driven cars. Despite recent developments in the area, none of the proposed approaches are suitable and flexible enough to be applied in an efficient way to a running kernel. Aiming to fill such a gap, this paper proposes a formal verification approach for the Linux kernel, based on automata models. It presents a method to auto-generate verification code from an automaton, which can be integrated into a module and dynamically added into the kernel for efficient on-the-fly verification of the system, using in-kernel tracing features.

In 2019, most securities trading is conducted electronically on digital markets. One type of trading strategy, high-frequency trading, utilizes algorithms, data centers, fiber optic cables, and supercomputers to obtain an edge in the market. High-frequency trading has leveraged advancements in technology to constitute over half of all trading volume in a given day. High-frequency trading, however, has come under scrutiny in recent years as it has increased market susceptibility to certain forms of criminal conduct. In 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld the first conviction of a high-frequency trader for spoofing, a type of trader misconduct that is made more susceptible by high-frequency trading. While scholars have debated whether high-frequency trading should be regulated more than other types of trading and if so, what the regulations might look like, no one has analyzed criminal law as a vehicle to regulate high-frequency trading. This Comment makes the case that individual criminal liability is an ideal tool to regulate misconduct in the high-frequency trading space. Two features of high-frequency trading make the strategy particularly challenging to regulate: 1) it is difficult to draw a line between legitimate and illegitimate behavior in high-frequency trading; and 2) it is difficult to pinpoint an exact definition of what high-frequency trading is. Criminal liability has several advantages over civil liability with respect to these challenges. First, the mens rea component and higher standard of proof required in criminal liability will ensure that high-frequency traders found criminally liable engaged in illegitimate behavior with a higher degree of certainty. Second, the threat of criminal prosecution will better serve the goal of deterring high-frequency trader misconduct. Within the context of criminal liability, individual criminal liability is preferable to corporate criminal liability because the former better furthers the goal of deterrence. The identity problem that corporate liability helps to solve—in some corporate contexts it is impossible to pinpoint culpability on any single individual—is not an issue in high-frequency trading; and individual criminal liability is socially more preferable as a matter of policy. Accordingly, the government should increase criminal enforcement of high-frequency traders to promote its goal of safeguarding market integrity. © 2019 by Orlando Cosme Jr."

When generalized to multiple agents, the resulting stochastic game is notoriously difficult to solve in closed-form. Here, we circumvent the difficulties by investigating a mean-field game framework containing (i) a major agent who is liquidating a large number of shares, (ii) a number of minor agents (high-frequency traders (HFTs)) who detect and trade against the liquidator, and (iii) noise traders who buy and sell for exogenous reasons. Our setup accounts for permanent price impact stemming from all trader types inducing an interaction between major and minor agents. Both optimizing agents trade against noise traders as well as one another. This stochastic dynamic game contains couplings in the price and trade dynamics, and we use a mean-field game approach to solve the problem. We obtain a set of decentralized feedback trading strategies for the major and minor agents, and express the solution explicitly in terms of a deterministic fixed point problem. For a finite N population of HFTs, the set of major-minor agent mean-field game strategies is shown to have a ϵN-Nash equilibrium property where ϵN→0 as N→∞. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Therefore, the A-type SVAR models are identified and estimated after setting up constraints, and all the models are tested stable.

It is evident from the literature that only a handful of methods had been proposed for stock market manipulation detection. Most of those methods either used supervised training or focused only on specific manipulation schemes. This paper introduces a semi-supervised learning method based on a hybridization of an altered dendritic cell immune system inspired approach and Kernel Density Estimation based clustering technique. Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DCA) mimics the human immune system in data processing using the danger theory model for anomaly detection. An important advantage of the proposed approach is that the DCA is adapted for scaling down the dimension of the input data set to a set of only three outputs that are then clustered using KDE clustering. This avoids the need for assigning different threshold parameters as in a conventional DCA, hence automating the detection process. Another important advantage is that supervised training is not required for signal categorization during the preprocessing phase of DCA. The proposed approach is validated on Level 1 stock price tick data obtained from the LOBSTER project which contains highly volatile and high frequency trading (HFT) time series. The considered manipulation schemes are Pump and Dump and Gouging or Spoof trading. The proposed approach is benchmarked against existing stock market manipulation detection approaches as well as existing anomaly detection techniques based on KNN, OCSVM, PCA and k-means. The obtained results show substantial improvements in terms of the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and the false alarm rate. © 2019 IEEE."

In this paper, the authors adopt the rule to analyze intraday trading, in which an open position is not left overnight. This paper aims to explore the relationship between intraday filter trading profitability and intraday realized volatilities. The bivariate thin plate spline (TPS) model is chosen to fit the predictor-response surface for high frequency data from the Hang Seng index futures (HSIF) market. The hypotheses follow the adaptive market hypothesis, arguing that intraday filter trading differs in profitability under different market conditions as measured by realized volatility, and furthermore, the optimal filter size for trading on each day is related to the realized volatility. The empirical results furnish new evidence that range-based realized volatilities (RaV) are more efficient in identifying trading profit than return-based volatilities (ReV). These results shed light on the efficiency of intraday high frequency trading in the HSIF market. Some trading suggestions are given based on the findings. Design/methodology/approach: Among all the factors that affect the profit of filter trading, intraday realized volatility stands out as an important predictor. The authors explore several intraday volatilities measures using range-based or return-based methods of estimation. The authors then study how the filter trading profit will depend on realized volatility and how the optimal filter size is related to the realized volatility. The bivariate TPS model is used to model the predictor-response relationship. Findings: The empirical results show that range-based realized volatility has a higher predictive power on filter rule trading profit than the return-based realized volatility. Originality/value: First, the authors contribute to the literature by investigating the profitability of the filter trading rule on high frequency tick-by-tick data of HSIF market. Second, the authors test the assumption that the magnitude of the intraday momentum trading profit depends on the realized volatilities and aims to identify a relationship between them. Furthermore, the authors consider several intraday realized volatilities and find the RaV have the higher prediction power than ReV. Finally, the authors find some relationship between the optimal filter size and the realized volatilities. Based on the observations, the authors also give some trading suggestions to the intraday filter traders. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited."

The market microstructure approach focuses on analysis of market frictions impacting on how new equilibriums are being come upon. Market frictions exist due to fragmented market structure and information asymmetries. Respectively, the article (Part 1) compares ""market microstructure"" and ""market structure""; reveals drivers of spatial and temporal fragmentation (including breakdown of modern trading protocols and participation models); analyzes information (self-) lear ning of market and adverse selection; makes distinctions between ""market quality"", ""market efficiency"" and ""market liquidity""; and traces how the market efficiency and equilibrium concepts were evolving when market frictions drew attention. How the market microstructure approach may work is demonstrated in the course of a high-frequency trading (HFT) case study in Part 2 of the article. HFT has brought new evidence that market structure matters-both as an environment where tech innovations are only possible and as mechanisms to be adjusted to new challenges-and has outlined directions for further elaborations on basic microstructural concepts.

The purpose of this work is to develop an agent that will be able to negotiate given partial information about the user’s preferences. First, we present a new partial information model that is supplied to the agent, which is based on categorical data in the form of pairwise comparisons of outcomes instead of precise utility information. Using this partial information, we develop an estimation model that uses linear optimization and translates the information into utility estimates. We test our methods in a negotiation scenario based on a smart grid cooperative where agents participate in energy trade-offs. The results show that already with very limited information the model becomes accurate quickly and performs well in an actual negotiation setting.

This paper utilizes panel data from China's stock market in an attempt to answer whether the illiquidity risk in various dimensions—including price impacts, the transaction speed, trading volume, transaction costs, and asymmetric information—can explain stock returns. We find that almost all dimensions of stock illiquidity are positively associated with excess stock returns. More importantly, smaller, less-liquid stocks suffer more liquidity costs, providing a strong evidence for “flight-to-liquidity.” Additionally, the transaction costs and asymmetric information, denoted by bid-ask spreads, robustly account for these illiquidity effects on stock pricing and differ from the findings in the U.S. market. We also find that the “flight-to-liquidity” can partially explain the idiosyncratic volatility puzzle, investors’ gambling, and herding psychologies.

In this paper, we propose a neural network layer architecture that incorporates the idea of bilinear projection as well as an attention mechanism that enables the layer to detect and focus on crucial temporal information. The resulting network is highly interpretable, given its ability to highlight the importance and contribution of each temporal instance, thus allowing further analysis on the time instances of interest.

An important area in the domain of price impact research is high-frequency trading (HFT), which contrary to many opinions and controversies (e.g. the false responsibility in the Flash-Crash of 6 May 2010) may in fact have a positive effect in market efficiency. In addition, they may also reduce transaction costs (spread) as a result of, for example, better price synchronization of financial instruments across markets. Performing literature research on both theoretical and empirical studies on market and limit orders and their impact in the price discovery process, it is shown that the choice between the order types is a strategic decision - even when considering that limit orders have the most long-term price impact. In addition, limit orders are preferred by informed traders as it limits adverse selection exposure. Similar reactions will be seen with HFT traders through limit orders aiming to reduce adverse selection risk and transaction costs, which in turn leads to an increase in transaction profits. © 2019 Narodowy Bank Polski.

Basically, a grid trading strategy is a method that seeks to make profit on the market movements of the underlying financial instrument by positioning buy and sell orders properly time-spaced (grid distance). The main advantage of the grid trading strategy is the financial sustainability of the algorithm because it provides a robust way to mediate losses in financial transactions even though this also means very complicated trades management algorithm. For these reasons, grid trading is certainly one of the best approaches to be used in high frequency trading (HFT) strategies. Due to the high level of unpredictability of the financial markets, many investment funds and institutional traders are opting for the HFT (high frequency trading) systems, which allow them to obtain high performance due to the large number of financial transactions executed in the short-term timeframe. The combination of HFT strategies with the use of machine learning methods for the financial time series forecast, has significantly improved the capability and overall performance of the modern automated trading systems. Taking this into account, the authors propose an automatic HFT grid trading system that operates in the FOREX (foreign exchange) market.

The Blockchain eschews a bank or other intermediary and allows parties to transfer funds directly to one another, using a peer-to-peer system. This disruptive technology has done for money transfers what email did for sending mail — by removing the need for a trusted third party just as email removed the need for using the post office to send mail. This technology mainly used for peer-to-peer money transfers, can also be extended to accomplish other forms of transfers. Blockchain technology can be used to buy and sell stocks. Real world stocks can be tokenized into digital stocks which can be easily transferred using peer-to-peer. These digital stocks act similar to digital currency whose price is real time and fluctuates.

However, there are only very few works considering the stability of the EFSs, and these studies were limited to certain types of membership functions with specifically predefined parameters, which largely increases the complexity of the learning process. At the same time, stability analysis is of paramount importance for control applications and provides the theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the learning algorithms. In this paper, we introduce the stability proof of a class of EFSs based on data clouds, which are grounded at the AnYa type fuzzy systems and the recently introduced empirical data analytics (EDA) methodological framework. By employing data clouds, the class of EFSs of AnYa type considered in this paper avoids the traditional way of defining membership functions for each input variable in an explicit manner and its learning process is entirely data driven. The stability of the considered EFS of AnYa type is proven through the Lyapunov theory, and the proof of stability shows that the average identification error converges to a small neighborhood of zero. Although, the stability proof presented in this paper is specially elaborated for the considered EFS, it is also applicable to general EFSs. The proposed method is illustrated with Box-Jenkins gas furnace problem, one nonlinear system identification problem, Mackey-Glass time series prediction problem, eight real-world benchmark regression problems as well as a high-frequency trading prediction problem. Compared with other EFSs, the numerical examples show that the considered EFS in this paper provides guaranteed stability as well as a better approximation accuracy. © 1993-2012 IEEE."

The prediction was made through the extreme learning machine optimized by the adaptive whale optimization algorithm based on the multi-resolution singular value decomposition. The multi-resolution singular value decomposition was used to eliminate the high frequency components of the previous carbon price data. Afterwards, the carbon price was successfully decomposed into two time series—the approximation series and the detailed series. The partial auto-correlation function was employed in the approximation series for determining the input variables of the extreme learning machine. The adaptive whale optimization algorithm was utilized to optimize both the input weight matrix and the bias matrix to improve the robustness and accuracy of extreme learning machines. The empirical simulation based on four diverse types of carbon prices under carbon trading pilot programs in China found that the proposed model outperformed the other benchmark methods. Four different matured carbon future prices under the European Union national emissions trading scheme (EU ETS) were also selected for forecasting. The results showed that the proposed model performed fairly well in forecasting the EU carbon price. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"

However, due to the high level of complexity regarding the forecasting of day trading trends, the use of traditional financial analysis or technical indicators for the forecasting of short-term market trends is often ineffective. The main reason is that in addition to the technical analysis of market physical trends, financial market trading behaviors are also often affected by psychological factors such as greed and fear, which are emotions displayed by investors during the transaction process. For this reason, this study will use the neural network to integrate into the financial engineering technology analysis of the physical momentum behavior and market profile theory to quantify controlled learning. The goal is to be able to provide an empirical explanation of the discoveries related to trading behaviors by using trading strategies. Our experiments showed that trading behaviors in the financial market could be explained by the physical trends of a quantitative and technical analysis of the market profile theory.

We prove that when the first three of these stylized facts are considered within the framework of our microscopic model, it behaves in the long run as a Heston stochastic volatility model, where a leverage effect is generated.

The hypothesis states that, in large price swing scenarios, circuit breakers (limits or halts), by their very existence, invite trading activities toward themselves in a way that the prophecy of the trigger is fulfilled. Most empirical works testing this effect hail from East Asian exchanges, which typically employ a tight price band. Our empirical venue, Bursa Malaysia, is a marked exception, sticking to a ±30% limit since 1989. Employing high-frequency (millisecond) proprietary intraday data from 2015 to 2017, we examine the magnet effect through order aggression and price velocity as the possibility of a limit draws closer. We find evidence of moderate magnet effect for most stocks, suggesting accelerated trading activities proportionate to likelihood of a limit-hit. The effect is more pronounced for lower limit stocks. Interestingly, several upper limit scenarios also exhibit the opposite of magnet effect: the repellent effect, suggesting investors recoil from trading when a limit-hit appears imminent.

In contemporary stock markets, high frequency trading bots that continuously buy and sell stocks, increasingly perform the role of market makers. These bots provide the market with liquidity by usually being ready to take the buy or sell end of a stock trade. However, these algorithms are also reading news stories and social media posts at lightning speed, and when they detect uncertainty they will pull out of the market causing a stock, or group of stocks, to drop rapidly in value. This text examines the technical and legal aspects of the contemporary networked stock exchange system that make Public Dissentiment’s intervention possible and provides a context for these factors through an analysis of how they produced a space for artistic intervention. Locating this work in the frames of hacktivism, tactical media, and other historical precedents for both network and financial interventions further contextualizes this project. Public Dissentiment falls into the category of mass action hacktivism, which is closely associated with tactical media and culture jamming, and typically includes a performative element.

We study the US dollar, the British pound and the Japanese yen vs the euro over the period 2002–2016 using weekly data and we find that both types of agents react to the same transition variable, viz. the absolute distance of the actual exchange rate to its relative PPP value. The spot foreign currency demand of fundamentalists is driven by the size of the misalignment both directly and through a transition function, which models the adoption of fundamental strategies by newcomers. The number of chartists also varies according to the absolute distance of the exchange rate change from its fundamental PPP value.

It is expected to stabilize the stock markets and enhance the efficiency of the market allocations. The existence of the cooling-off effect or the magnet effect, induced by the price limit trading rule, is the main controversy of this policy. In this paper, we investigate the cooling-off effect (opposite to the magnet effect) from two aspects. Firstly, from the viewpoint of dynamics, we study the existence of the cooling-off effect by following the dynamical evolution of some financial variables over a period of time before the stock price hits its limit. Secondly, from the probability perspective, we investigate, with the logit model, the existence of the cooling-off effect through analyzing the high-frequency data of all A-share common stocks traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange from 2000 to 2011 and inspecting the trading period from the opening phase prior to the moment that the stock price hits its limits. A comparison is made of the properties between up-limit hits and down-limit hits, and the possible difference will also be compared between bullish and bearish market state by dividing the whole period into three alternating bullish periods and three bearish periods. We find that the cooling-off effect emerges for both up-limit hits and down-limit hits, and the cooling-off effect of the down-limit hits is stronger than that of the up-limit hits. The difference of the cooling-off effect between bullish period and bearish period is quite modest.

Going beyond existing literature, our focal point here is the rebalancing frequency which we include as an additional parameter in the maximization. The problem is first set up in a control-theoretic framework, and then, the main question we address is as follows: In the absence of transaction costs, does high-frequency trading always lead to the best performance? Related to this question is our prior work on Kelly betting which examines the impact of making a wager and letting it ride. Our prior results indicate that it is often the case that there are no performance benefits associated with high-frequency trading. In the present paper, we generalize the analysis from the single-asset case to a portfolio with multiple risky assets. We show that if there is an asset satisfying a certain dominance condition, then an optimal portfolio consists of this asset alone; i.e., if the trader puts 'all eggs in one basket,' performance becomes a constant function of rebalancing frequency. Said another way, the problem of rebalancing is rendered moot. The paper also includes simulations which address practical considerations associated with real stock prices vis-a-vis the dominance condition. © 2018 IEEE."

As a result, most volatility plays are for option sellers, but the profit they can achieve is limited and the sellers carry unlimited risk. This paper aims to demonstrate the dynamics of implied volatility (IV) as being influenced by effects of persistence, leverage, market sentiment and liquidity. From the exploratory factor analysis (EFA), they extract four constructs and the results from the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) indicated a good model fit for the constructs. Design/methodology/approach: This section describes the methodology used for conducting the study. This includes the study area, study approach, sources of data, sampling technique and the method of data analysis. Findings: Although there is extensive literature on methods for estimating IV dynamics during earnings announcement, few researchers have looked at the impact of expected market maker move, IV differential and IV Rank on the IV path after the earnings announcement. One reason for this research gap is because of the recent introduction of weekly options for equities by the Chicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE) back in late 2010. Even then, the CBOE only released weekly options four individual equities – Bank of America (BAC.N), Apple (AAPL.O), Citigroup (C.N) and US-listed shares of BP (BP.L) (BP.N). The introduction of weekly options provided more trading flexibility and precision timing from shorter durations. This automatically expanded expiration choices, which in turned offered greater access and flexibility from the perspective of trading volatility during earnings announcement. This study has demonstrated the impact of including market sentiment and liquidity into the forecasting model for IV during earnings. This understanding in turn helps traders to formulate strategies that can circumvent the undefined risk associated with trading options strategies such as writing strangles. Research limitations/implications: The first limitation of the study is that the firms included in the study are relatively large, and the results of the study can therefore not be generalized to medium sized and small firms. The second limitation lies in the current sample size, which in many cases was not enough to be able to draw reliable conclusions on. Scaling the sample size up is only a function of time and effort. This is easily overcome and should not be a limitation in the future. The third limitation concerns the measurement of the variables. Under the assumption of a normal distribution of returns (i.e. stock prices follow a random walk process), which means that the distribution of returns is symmetrical, one can estimate the probabilities of potential gains or losses associated with each amount. This means the standard deviation of securities returns, which is called historical volatility and is usually calculated as a moving average, can be used as a risk indicator. The prices used for the calculations are usually the closing prices, but Parkinson (1980) suggests that the day’s high and low prices would provide a better estimate of real volatility. One can also refine the analysis with high-frequency data. Such data enable the avoidance of the bias stemming from the use of closing (or opening) prices, but they have only been available for a relatively short time. The length of the observation period is another topic that is still under debate. There are no criteria that enable one to conclude that volatility calculated in relation to mean returns over 20 trading days (or one month) and then annualized is any more or less representative than volatility calculated over 130 trading days (or six months) and then annualized, or even than volatility measured directly over 260 trading days (one year). Nonetheless, the guidelines adopted in this study represent the best practices of researchers thus far. Practical implications: This study has indicated that an earnings announcement can provide a volatility mispricing opportunity to allow an investor to profit from a sudden, sharp drop in IV. More specifically, the methodology developed by Tan and Bing is now well supported both empirically and theoretically in terms of qualifying opportunities that can be profitable because of the volatility crush. Conventionally, the option strategy of shorting strangles carries unlimited theoretical risk; however, the methodology has demonstrated that this risk can be substantially reduced if followed judiciously. This profitable strategy relies on a set of qualifying parameters including liquidity, premium collection, volatility differential, expected market move and market sentiment. Building upon this framework, the understanding of the effects of persistence and leverage resulted in further reducing the risk associated with trading options during earnings announcements. As a guideline, the sentiment and liquidity variables help to qualify a trade and the effects of persistence and leverage help to close the qualified trade. Social implications: The authors find a positive association between the effects of market sentiment, liquidity, persistence and leverage in the dynamics of IV during earnings announcement. These findings substantiate further the four factors that influence IV dynamics during earnings announcement and conclude that just looking at persistence and leverage alone will not generate profitable trading opportunities. Originality/value: The impact of volatility crush can be devastating to the option buyer with substantial capital loss, even for a directionally correct strategy. As a result, most volatility plays are for option sellers; however, the profit is limited and the sellers carry unlimited risk. The authors demonstrate the dynamics of IV as being influenced by effects of persistence, leverage, market sentiment and liquidity. From the EFA, they extracted four constructs and the results from the CFA indicated a good model fit for the constructs.

The following sentences have been corrected in the published article: Page 461, footnote 5: See “Fast Traders Are Getting Data from SEC Seconds-Early,” Wall Street Journal, October 29, 2014. Page 461, footnote 7: Refer to the letter from SEC Chair, Mary Jo White. Page 464, footnote 13: Our paper, along with contemporaneous work by JM, was prominently covered in a front page article in the Wall Street Journal on October 29, 2014, in a story that publicized the fact that EDGAR provided PDS subscribers with a timing advantage (“Fast Traders Are Getting Data from SEC Seconds Early,” Wall Street Journal, October 29, 2014). Our interactions with the SEC in the early fall of 2014 suggest that it was not aware of the timing advantage available to the PDS subscribers prior to seeing our paper. On December 19, 2014, Mary Jo White, the SEC Chair, announced plans to enhance the system and that these enhancements were expected to be in place in the first quarter of 2015 (refer to the letter from SEC Chair, Mary Jo White, available at http://freepdfhosting.com/If29e3046a.pdf). Page 469, footnote 17: As noted above, the SEC made changes to the EDGAR/PDS in February 2015, at least in part due to the publicity that resulted from our study. Page 469, footnote 18: The SEC describes EDGAR as follows: “EDGAR, the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system, performs automated collection, validation, indexing, acceptance, and forwarding of submissions by companies and others who are required by law to file forms with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).” Page 470, second paragraph: Our discussions with SEC staff indicate the EDGAR initially transmits filings to the PDS and waits for an (automated) acknowledgment of receipt. Page 471, footnote 23: We initially obtained these times using real-time “scrapes” of the EDGAR site. Page 472, figure 2 caption: The sample included in the plot are all Form 4 insider trade filings between March 1, 2012 and December 31, 2013 that are unique to a firm within a five-minute window and that we can match to the SEC filing on EDGAR (i.e., line 3 from table 1). Page 473, last paragraph: We then use the insider name and company Central Index Key (CIK) to match to the SEC filing, which reduces the sample to 88,841 trades. Page 476, third paragraph: Most firms have stringent policies that govern trading by corporate officers and board members, and typically handle Form 4 filings in a routine way to ensure compliance with SEC requirements (Bettis, Coles, and Lemmon [2000], Jagolinzer, Larcker, and Taylor [2011]). Page 482, fourth paragraph: Across all SEC filings for our sample period (March 2012 through December 2013), there are 142,443 (261,132) Form 4 filings and 422,454 (385,766) filings of other types made during (outside) trading hours. Page 495, third paragraph: Thus, the weekday period during which the SEC accepts new filings and the markets are open for extended trading is between 8:00 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. Page 497, second paragraph: We provide evidence on the timeliness of the EDGAR process used by the SEC to publicly disseminate Form 4 insider filings. Page 497, second paragraph: Although we focus on Form 4 filings, the SEC uses the same dissemination process for all regulatory filings, and the timing advantages extend to other filing types. Page 498, first paragraph: First, if all filings were indeed publicly available on the FTP server prior to being disseminated to paying PDS subscribers, one might argue that the SEC has (at least theoretically) provided a level playing field (i.e., anyone with a computer and some programming knowledge could technically be the first person to find a new filing). Second, if this was true, researchers would not need access to private PDS feeds when researching HFT around SEC filings. Page 500, second paragraph: Third, the SEC has never refuted our findings and it has agreed to remedy the issue that we identified.

Two types of agents, which consist of fundamental traders and technical analysts, are considered in the proposed model. They differ in the expectation of future asset returns and the perceived risk. This paper incorporates the unique characteristics of high-frequency data into the model for the purpose of having a reliable and accurate empirical result. In particular, a two-test procedure is developed to test the market fractions hypothesis that distinguishes the heterogeneous agent model from the representative agent model. The proposed heterogeneous agent model is estimated on the Taiwan Stock Exchange data. The results suggest that fundamental traders expect the correction of over- or under-pricing in the future. Technical analysts act as contrarian traders. Technical analysts also believe that buyer-initiated (seller-initiated) trading will further raise (lower) future prices. The bid-ask spread has a crucial effect on the investment risk for the technical analysts. Moreover, technical analysts are short-sighted, have less market fraction, but perform slightly better. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Firstly, we categorize the virtual servers in the trading system of TSE, each of which is linked to a single trading participant, by the ratio of cancellation and execution in the order placement as well as the number of executions at the opening of the afternoon session. Then, we analyze ordering patterns of the servers in the categories in short intervals for the top 10 highest trading volume stocks. By classifying the intervals into four cases by returns, we observe how different types of market participants submit or execute orders in the market situations. Moreover, we investigate the shares of the executed volumes for the different types of servers in the swings and roundabouts of the Nikkei 225 index, which were observed in September in 2015. The main findings of this study are as follows: Server type A, which supposedly includes non-market making proprietary traders with high-speed algorithmic strategies, executes and places orders along with the direction of the market. The shares of the execution and order volumes along with the market direction increase when the stock price moves sharply. Server type B, which presumably includes servers employing a market making strategy with high cancellation and low execution ratio, shifts its market making price ranges in the rapid price movements. We observe that passive servers in Server type B have a large share and buy at low levels in the price falls. Also, Server type B, as well as Server type A, makes profit in the price falling days and particularly, the aggressive servers in the server type make most of the profit. Server type C, which is assumed to include servers receiving orders from small investors, constantly has a large share of execution and order volume. © 2018, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature."

For this reason, there are various Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models worldwide that are run on either a local or a global scale. NWP models typically take hours to finish a complete run, however, depending on the input parameters and the size of the forecast domain. Provenance information is of central importance for detecting unexpected events that may develop during the course of model execution, and also for taking necessary action as early as possible. In addition, the need to share scientific data and results between researchers or scientists also highlights the importance of data quality and reliability. This can only be achieved through provenance information collected during the entire lifecycle of the data of interest. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model is a Numerical Weather Prediction model developed as open source. In this study, we develop a framework for tracking the WRF model and for generating, storing and analyzing provenance data. The proposed system enables easy management and understanding of numerical weather forecast workflows by providing provenance graphs. By analyzing these graphs, potential faulty situations that may occur during the execution of WRF can be traced to their root causes.

We challenge and complicate this account of the relation between consciousness, affect and media technologies by drawing on the recent work of N. Katherine Hayles and by focusing in detail on the ways in which the ‘costs of consciousness’ are accounted for and negotiated in high-frequency trading.

The change in trader price focus around the euro introduction addresses an open debate in the clustering literature on whether the presence of clustering is a bias related to the current prices or anchoring to past prices. Our findings of a decline in drachma clustering, but lack of switch to euro effects supports the case for clustering being a trading feature that is slow to transfer to new pricing regimes.

We show the security properties that guarantee an Exchange's economic viability (availability of trading information, liquidity, confidentiality of positions, absence of price discrimination, risk-management) and an attack when traders' anonymity is broken. We describe all key operations for a secure, fully distributed Futures-Exchange, hereafter referred to as simply the ''Exchange''. Our distributed, asynchronous protocol simulates the centralized functionality under the assumptions of anonymity of the physical layer and availability of a distributed ledger. We consider security with abort (in absence of honest majority) and extend it to penalties. Our proof of concept implementation and its optimization (based on zk-SNARKs and SPDZ) demonstrate that the computation of actual trading days (along Thomson-Reuters Tick History DB) is feasible for low-frequency markets; however, more research is needed for high-frequency ones. © 2018 IEEE."

Based on a large data-set of ultra-high-frequency transaction prices time-stamped to the millisecond of the S&P500 index and its two most liquid tracking ETFs, we find that their lead–lag relationship is affected by the rate of information arrival whose proxy is the unexpected trading volume of these instruments. Specifically, when information arrives, the leadership of the leading instrument may strengthen or weaken depending on whether the leading or lagging instrument responds to that information. An increase in the unexpected volume of the leader strengthens its leadership whereas an increase in the unexpected volume of the lagger weakens this leadership. In addition to the strength of leadership, an increase in the unexpected volume in response to information arrival may also have opposite effects on the lead–lag correlation coefficient depending on whether that volume increase belongs to the leader or the lagger. Finally, we find that sophisticated investors have a more significant effect on the lead–lag relationship than non-sophisticated ones. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Third, the article demonstrates the contingency of these features by briefly comparing HFT in share trading to HFT in futures, Treasurys, and foreign exchange.

Such events occur very frequently, several hundred times a day for actively traded stocks. We find significant price impact associated with these market maker initiated events, about five times higher than during non-burst periods. Bursts in quotes are concurrent with short-lived structural breaks in the informational relationship between market makers and market takers. During bursts, market makers no longer passively impound information from order flow into quotes—a departure from the traditional market microstructure paradigm. Rather, market makers significantly impact prices during bursts in quotes. Further analysis shows that there is asymmetry in adverse selection between the bid and ask sides of the limit order book and only a sub-population of market makers enjoys an informational advantage during bursts. Market makers on the side opposite the burst suffer elevated adverse selection costs, while market makers on the side of the burst realize positive spread, irrespective of the order flow direction. Our results call attention to the need for a new microstructure perspective in understanding modern high-frequency limit order book markets and the quote manipulation strategies at the disposal of the fast market makers. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

This approach allows us to generalize the multiple-stage risk measures of value at risk and conditional value at risk for the feature-decomposed processes, and implement them into portfolio selection using high-frequency data of U.S. DJIA stocks.

Although efforts to develop an effective prediction method have a long history, recent developments in artificial intelligence and the use of artificial neural networks have increased our success in nonlinear approximation. When we study financial markets, we can now extract features from a big data environment without prior predictive information. We here propose to further improve this predictive performance using a combination of a deep-learning-based stock index futures prediction model, an autoencoder, and a restricted Boltzmann machine. We use high-frequency data to examine the predictive performance of deep learning, and we compare three traditional artificial neural networks: 1) the back propagation neural network; 2) the extreme learning machine; and 3) the radial basis function neural network. We use all of the 1-min high-frequency transaction data of the CSI 300 futures contract (IF1704) in our empirical analysis, and we test three groups of different volume samples to validate our observations. We find that the deep learning method of predicting stock index futures outperforms the back propagation, the extreme learning machine, and the radial basis function neural network in its fitting degree and directional predictive accuracy. We also find that increasing the amount of data increases predictive performance. This indicates that deep learning captures the nonlinear features of transaction data and can serve as a powerful stock index futures prediction tool for financial market investors. © 2013 IEEE."

Adjusting HAR model with measurement error promotes model persistence. Further combine the model with time-varying parameter model which is nonlinear, so that structure change and reduction of heteroscedasticity are achieved. Realized range-based volatility is computed based on high-frequency data of CSI300 (2652 trading days) to test the effect of the models. Among the fixed parameter models, the out-of-sample forecasting performance is significantly improved by adding measurement error as adjustment variable. Among the time-varying parameter models, most of the models with measurement error dominate their corresponding models without measurement error.

Many machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network, and Hidden Markov Model, have been applied to it and achieved positive results. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), as a variant of RNN, can obtain hidden dependencies in data and has shown a significant performance in processing time series data. In this paper, we apply LSTM networks to predict the price movement of a short-term and test it by an experiment on some stocks randomly selected from CSI 300 constituent stocks. The experiment shows that the precision, recall rate and critical error of LSTM are all better than that of the random prediction.

To model the structural dependence, the mid-price processes follow a multivariate reflected Brownian motion on the closure of a no-arbitrage region which is dictated by the bid-ask spreads of the assets. We provide a mathematical framework for such an economy and solve for the value function and optimal control for an investor who takes positions in these assets. The optimal strategy exhibits two dominant features which depend on how far the vector of mid-prices is from the no-arbitrage bounds. When mid-prices are sufficiently far from the no-arbitrage edges, the strategy behaves as that of a market maker who posts buy and sell limit orders. And when the mid-price vector is close to the edge of the no-arbitrage region, the strategy executes a combination of market orders and limit orders to profit from statistical arbitrages. We discuss a numerical scheme to solve for the value function and optimal control, and perform a simulation study to discuss the main characteristics of the optimal strategy. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company."

In this paper, we examine the out-of-sample point and density forecasting performance of Bayesian Autoregressive Conditional Volume (ACV) models for intra-day volume data. Based on 5-min traded volume data for stocks quoted on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, a leading stock market in Central and Eastern Europe, we find that, in terms of point forecasts, the considered linear ACV models significantly outperform benchmarks such as the naïve and Rolling Means methods but not necessarily Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) models. Moreover, the point forecasts obtained within the exponential error ACV model are significantly superior to those calculated in other competing structures for which Burr or generalized gamma distributions are specified. The main finding from the analysis of density forecasts is that, in many cases, the linear ACV models with the Burr and generalized gamma distributions provide significantly better density forecasts than the linear ACV model with exponential innovations and the ARMA models in terms of the log-predictive score, calibration and sharpness. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Our paper uses recent high-frequency data (HFD) and investigates price comovements in the context of normal times and crisis periods. To this end, we applied a non-Gaussian Asymmetrical Dynamic Conditional Correlation (ADCC)-GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity) model and the Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES) approach. This choice has three advantages: (i) With the development of high-frequency trading (HFT), it is more appropriate to use HFD to test price linkages for overlapping and nonoverlapping data. (ii) The ADCC-GARCH model captures further asymmetry in price comovements. (iii) The use of the MES enables to measure systemic risk contributions around the distribution tails. Accordingly, we offer two interesting findings. First, while the hypothesis of asymmetrical and time-varying stock return linkages is not rejected, the MES approach indicates that both European and US indices make a considerable contribution to each other's systemic risk, with significant input from Frankfurt to the French and US markets, especially following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Second, we show that the propagation of systemic risk is higher during the crisis period and overlapping trading hours than during nonoverlapping hours. Thus, the MES test is recommended as an indicator to help monitor market exposure to systemic risk and to gauge expected losses for other markets. Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2017."

Furthermore, with non-synchronous trading and contamination of microstructure noise, we propose a nonparametrically eigenvalue-regularized integrated covariance matrix estimator (NERIVE) which does not assume specific structures for the underlying integrated covariance matrix. We show that NERIVE is positive definite in probability, with extreme eigenvalues shrunk nonlinearly under the high dimensional framework p∕n→c>0. We also prove that in portfolio allocation, the minimum variance optimal weight vector constructed using NERIVE has maximum exposure and actual risk upper bounds of order p−1∕2. Incidentally, the same maximum exposure bound is also satisfied by the theoretical minimum variance portfolio weights. All these results hold true also under a jump–diffusion model for the log-price processes with jumps removed using the wavelet method proposed in Fan and Wang (2007). They are further extended to accommodate the existence of pervasive factors such as a market factor under the setting p3∕2∕n→c>0. The practical performance of NERIVE is illustrated by comparing to the usual two-scale realized covariance matrix as well as some other nonparametric alternatives using different simulation settings and a real data set. © 2018 Elsevier B.V."

For instance, by allowing expectations about the future to become more harmonized and orderly, they act as stabilizers for the provision of liquidity. Conventions might, of course, change at any time. Nonetheless, by being attached to the daily trading routine and/or integrated within the institutional structure, the confidence in their relevance and validity can be long-lasting. In the foreign exchange market, in particular, where prices are quoted to end-users on demand, market-making banks rely on a convention to quote prices to each other to maintain liquidity. However, the rise of algorithmic and high-frequency trading poses a practical as well as a theoretical challenge to such conventions. By reacting ultra-fast to new information, including to new limit orders submitted by others, markets largely populated with algorithmic traders have become susceptible to a withdrawal of liquidity at an unprecedented speed and scale. Using a high-frequency dataset provided by Electronic Broking Services (EBS), we investigate the process of liquidity withdrawal from the foreign exchange spot market. By doing so, we consider the crowding out of conventions associated with liquidity provision, traditionally upheld through mutual understanding among financial institutions–in other words, reciprocity and trust among humans. © 2018, © 2018, Journal of Economic Issues / Association for Evolutionary Economics."

Several studies, using daily stock prices, have presented predictive system applications trained on fixed periods without considering new model updates. In this context, this study uses a machine learning technique called Support Vector Regression (SVR) to predict stock prices for large and small capitalisations and in three different markets, employing prices with both daily and up-to-the-minute frequencies. Prediction errors are measured, and the model is compared to the random walk model proposed by the EMH.

As a result, the better performing assets will receive more investment. The proposed PPT objective can be formulated as a fast backpropagation algorithm, which is suitable for large-scale and time-limited applications, such as high-frequency trading. Extensive experiments on several benchmark data sets from diverse real financial markets show that PPT outperforms other state-of-the-art systems in computational time, cumulative wealth, and risk-adjusted metrics.

Aiming at the discreteness, non-normality, high-noise in high-frequency data, a support vector machine regression (SVR) algorithm is introduced in this paper. However, the characteristics in different periods of the same stock, or the same periods of different stocks are significantly different. So, SVR with fixed parameters is difficult to satisfy with the constantly changing data flow. To tackle this problem, an adaptive SVR was proposed for stock data at three different time scales, including daily data, 30-min data, and 5-min data. Experiments show that the improved SVR with dynamic optimization of learning parameters by particle swarm optimization can get a better result than compared methods including SVR and back-propagation neural network. © 2013 IEEE."

Due to the high frequency, impulse radio (IR) in this band is better suited for positioning than other existing low-frequency bands. Besides precision positioning, the exceptionally wide bandwidth also enables concurrent use of multiple center frequencies in the same application, which opens up additional avenues of information encoding in IR mmWave networks. In this paper, we propose a new mmWave IR framework that can simultaneously detect direction of arrival (DOA) as well as the center frequency of the transmitted pulse. Based on the emerging graphene-based transceivers, we evaluate the performance of the proposed framework in the higher frequency region of mmWave band (100-300GHz). Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can detect the DOA of a 0.1 µW mmWave pulse within 1 degree of precision at 20 meters, and classify three different center frequencies with 100% accuracy from a distance of 10 meters. These performances could be further improved by trading off the pulse rate of the system. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery."

For this purpose, transaction data for individual traders are studied recently as empirical analyses. However, there are few empirical studies addressing how traders submit limit and market order at the level of individual traders. Since limit and market orders are key ingredients finally leading to transactions, it would be necessary to understand what kind of strategies are actually employed among traders before making transactions. Here we demonstrate the variety of limit-order and market-order strategies and show their roles in the financial markets from an ecological perspective. We find these trading strategies can be well-characterized by their response pattern to historical price changes. By applying a clustering analysis, we provide an overall picture of trading strategies as an ecological matrix, illustrating that liquidity consumers are likely to exhibit high trading performances compared with liquidity providers. Furthermore, we reveal both high-frequency traders (HFTs) and low-frequency traders (LFTs) exhibit high trading performance, despite the difference in their trading styles; HFTs attempt to maximize their trading efficiency by reducing risk, whereas LFTs make their profit by taking risk. © 2018 Sueshige et al.

This method is based on intraday data and can easily be used to conduct a short-run analysis of volatility spillovers. This new approach consists of three steps: first, the removal of intraday periodicity, then, the estimation of intraday volatility, and, finally, the calculation of volatility spillovers. We use the IVSI approach to examine the influence of the Brexit vote on volatility spillovers among five major European stock markets. Empirical results show no apparent changes in the connectedness of these markets, in a sample period after the vote that is three months long. But when the period is reduced to one month, the volatility spillovers in these markets clearly increase, with a changed spillover mechanism. Further dynamic studies indicate that after the vote the volatility spillovers increase in the first month and then decrease in the second month. More interestingly and unexpectedly, on the first trading day after the Brexit vote, the volatility spillover among these European markets largely diminishes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V."

In combination, regulatory reform to encourage competition has resulted in market fragmentation, such that a single financial instrument can now be traded across multiple venues. This has led to the proliferation of high-frequency trading (HFT), and the ability to engage in latency arbitrage (taking advantage of accessing and acting upon price information before it is received by others). The impact of HFT and the consequences of latency arbitrage is a contentious issue. In 2013, Wah and Wellman used an agent-based model to study latency arbitrage in a fragmented market. They showed: (a) market efficiency is negatively affected by the actions of a latency arbitrageur; and (b) introducing a discrete-time call auction (DCA) eliminates latency arbitrage opportunities and improves efficiency. Here, we explore and extend Wah and Wellman's model, and demonstrate that results are sensitive to the bid-shading parameter used for zero-intelligence (ZIC) trading agents. To overcome this, we introduce the more realistic, minimally intelligent trading algorithm, ZIP. Using ZIP, we reach contrary conclusions: (a) fragmented markets benefit from latency arbitrage; and (b) DCAs do not improve efficiency. We present these results as evidence that the debate on latency arbitrage in financial markets is far from definitively settled, and suggest that ABM simulation-a form of decentralised collective computational intelligence-is a productive method for understanding and engineering financial systems. © 2018 IEEE."

The flaw - essentially, a glitch introduced in the transition from human-based financial exchanges to electronic ones - is to treat time as a continuous variable, and process requests to trade serially. This combination of continuous time and serial processing creates mechanical arbitrage opportunities based on symmetric public information - a violation of efficient markets theory, built right into the market design! - - which in turn harms liquidity provision and induces a never-ending, socially wasteful, arms race for speed. That is, much of high-frequency trading is a symptom of flawed market design. We propose an alternative market design, called frequent batch auctions, in which time is discrete and orders are batch processed using auctions, and show that this directly fixes the problem with the continuous market. The second part of this talk will ask whether the “market will fix the market?” - that is, whether market forces will lead to the adoption of discrete-time trading instead of continuous-time trading, or whether a regulatory intervention would be needed. This requires a model of how modern stock exchanges compete and earn profits, the subject of new work-in-progress with Lee and Shim [2]. The model shows that competition among stock exchanges is fierce on the dimension of traditional trading fees, but that exchanges have market power in the sale of exchange-specific speed technology - i.e., arms for the arms race. We then use the model to study the private and social returns to market design innovation. We find that even though the social returns to adopting discrete-time trading would be large and positive, the private returns can be negative, due to the loss of rents from speed technology. We discuss some modest policy interventions that could tip the balance of incentives and encourage the “market to fix the market”. Last, I will discuss some open questions about financial market design that lie at the intersection of economics and computer science. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s)."

In our planned hypothesis tests, we find some evidence that the speed of the market response to filings increases with scriptability, but find little evidence that scriptability affects the incidence and speed of news dissemination by Dow Jones. In additional analyses, we find that scriptability exhibits both positive and negative associations with changes in information asymmetry between market participants, depending on the filing, trading window, and measure examined. We also find little evidence that XBRL interacts with scriptability in a meaningful way.

In attempting to answer these two fundamental questions, this essay reaches the following conclusions:1) smart contracts are not contracts; 2) the terms 'smart contract' and 'blockchain' are not interchangeable; 3) the legal problems raised by the smart contract phenomenon require an analytical approach strongly conditioned by the technological ecosystem of reference and must be assessed on a case-by-case basis; 4) for this reason too, the category in question has substantially no legal significance; 5) in any case, precisely because of this technological conditioning, any attempt by jurists to understand and regulate the phenomenon risks becoming obsolete at the very moment in which it is carried out; 6) furthermore, reasons, issues relating to the validity and effectiveness of so-called smart contracts, and those relating to any liability arising from them are normally handled independently by the computer systems concerned with no reference to the institutions and rules of the legal system, which concentrate solely on trying to avoid market distortions. The hypotheses outlined above, which certainly arouse general concern, are confirmed by observing what happens on the financial markets, where algorithmic trading (AT) and high-frequency trading (HFT) have become an established reality over the last few years and are continuing to grow. © 2018 Fondazione Gerardo Capriglione Onlus.

Based on these empirical findings, we introduce and calibrate a Markov chain-modulated pure jump model of price, spread, LO and MO arrivals and volume imbalance. As an application of the model, we pose and solve a stochastic control problem for an agent who maximizes terminal wealth, subject to inventory penalties, by executing trades using LOs. We use in-sample-data (January to June 2014) to calibrate the model to 11 equities traded in the Nasdaq exchange and use out-of-sample data (July to December 2014) to test the performance of the strategy.

This data is highly informative and describes physical pricing which allows to find complex patterns in price behaviour. Discovering such patterns manually is hard and time consuming. However, modern machine learning models are capable of solving such issues automatically adapting to changing price behavior. This research presents a trading system based on a machine learning model and market microstructure data. The data for the research has been collected from the Moscow stock exchange MICEX and provides event changes in the exchange book of applications and the tape of all transactions in a liquid stock exchange instrument. Logistic regression model has been used and compared to neural network models with different configuration. According to the study results, the logistic regression model is not inferior in forecasting quality to more complex models and at the same time it has a high forecast formation rate. It is very important when making trading decisions in the modern trading market. The developed trading system has an average frequency of transactions which allows to avoid expensive infrastructure compared to high-frequency exchange trading. However, it also allows to use the full potential of high-quality microstructural market data. The article describes all the stages of a trading system development, including feature engineering, a comparative analysis of price change forecasting models, and a trading algorithm with testing for historical data. It can be used by various investment institutions for the capital effective management in exchange trading. The development of more complex and detailed trading algorithms based on a machine learning model will increase the ultimate efficiency of the entire trading system. © 2018 Finance: Theory and Practice.

Assuming Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) preferences, with different relative risk aversion levels, we compare low and high frequency portfolios within mean-variance, mean-variance-skewness and mean-variance-skewness-kurtosis frameworks. Using data on fourteen stocks of the Euronext Paris, from January 1999 to December 2005, we conclude that the high frequency portfolios outperform the low frequency portfolios for every out-of-sample measure, irrespectively to the relative risk aversion coefficient considered. The empirical results also suggest that for moderate relative risk aversion the best performance is always achieved through the jointly use of the realized variance, skewness and kurtosis.

This paper will present a mathematical model for the cyclicality of the price evolution. The model can be applied for any equity in any financial market, using any timeframe. The method will gives us information about when is good to buy and when is better to sell. The price cyclicality model is also a method to establish when the price is approaching to change its behavior in order to build limit conditions to stay away the market and to minimize the risk. The fundamental news is already included in the price behavior. Being exclusively a mathematical model based on the price evolution, this method can be easily implemented in algorithmic trading.

Second, orders are expressed as continuous piecewise linear functions relating price to quantity rather than step functions defined on a discrete grid of prices and quantities.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper explores the difference between the daytime and overnight time returns by using nonparametric techniques. Moreover, investigation on some factors such as short selling, trading rules, risks are made to seek the sources of the day and night effects based on a large number of empirical analysis. In the end, further analyses on daytime and overnight returns are given by the use of high-frequency data and linear regression technique. Findings: The authors show that the daytime returns of CSI 300 index are no less than its overnight returns, while the daytime returns of CSI 300 index futures are no more than its overnight returns, even after removing the heteroscedasticity of the researched time series. Specifically, the PM returns (13:05 to close) play a quite important role in the intra-day time. The findings also suggest that the unique “T+1 trading rule” in China may be a reason that incurs the lower opening price in the morning and the higher closing price in the afternoon, resulting in the statistically significant differences between the daytime and overnight returns. Practical implications: The findings are of great importance for investors to decide when to buy and sell stock and futures portfolios in Chinese financial markets. Originality/value: This study empirically analyzes why there the higher daytime returns and the lower overnight returns exist in the Chinese stock markets from different aspects and contributes the existing literature on day and night effects because of periodic market closures. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."

(2005). An asymptotic normal theory is provided for the two-time scale ARVM and resulting realized covariations. The asymptotic normality is not directly applicable in practice to construct statistical methods owning to nuisance parameters. To bypass the nuisance parameter problem, two-stage stationary bootstrapping is proposed. We establish consistencies of the bootstrap distributions, and construct confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for the integrated covariance, regression coefficient and correlation coefficient. The validity of the stationary bootstrap for the high frequency heterogeneous returns is proved by showing that there exist parameters of the stationary bootstrap blocks so that the bootstrap consistencies hold. The proposed bootstrap methods extend the i.i.d. bootstrapping methods for realized covariations by Dovonon et al. (2013), that are confined to synchronous noise-free sampling. For high frequency noisy asynchronous samples, a Monte-Carlo experiment shows better finite sample performances of the proposed stationary bootstrap methods based on the two-time scale ARVM estimator than the wild blocks of blocks bootstrap methods of Hounyo (2017), based on pre-averaged truncated estimator. © 2017"

A fine time scale is used to accurately identify the locations of large rare jumps in the explanatory variables such as the price of the market portfolio. A coarse scale is then used in the estimation in order to attenuate the effect of trading frictions in the dependent variable such as the prices of potentially less liquid assets. The proposed estimator has a non-standard asymptotic distribution that cannot be made asymptotically pivotal via studentization. We propose a novel bootstrap procedure for feasible inference and justify its asymptotic validity. We show that the bootstrap provides an automatic higher-order asymptotic approximation by accounting for the sampling variation in estimates of nuisance quantities that are used in efficient estimation. The Monte Carlo analysis indicates good finite-sample performance of the general specification test and confidence intervals based on the bootstrap.

In this article, we focus on the sharp upward trend in stock trading since the 1980s. Globally, trading in equity markets have now hit over $100,000 billion, equivalent to nearly 150% of GDP, compared with only 5% in 1975. What is the ""social utility"" of all these trades? Stock market liquidity is undoubtedly a key factor in the cost of capital and, as such, a determinant of economic growth. However, the marginal effect is likely decreasing. Furthermore, many studies suggest that above a certain threshold, trading has a negative effect since: (i) companies benefit from the involvement of long-term investors; (ii) investors tend to perform too many trades; and (iii) it comes at the expense of transparency and erodes the trust vis-à-vis stock markets. A handful of measures have been taken to, if not reduce, then at least limit the growth in stock trading, but these have had only a very limited effect. Only comprehensive reforms of the architecture of stock markets could reverse this trend.

NY Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has referred to such fast data feeds as “Insider Trading 2.0”. For example, Thomson Reuters sold the University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Index to computerized trading firms 2 seconds before releasing its data to its other paying clients. This paper explores the ethical issues involved in the sale of such information. Is selling faster access ethically the same as traditional insider trading, which generally involves a breach of fiduciary duty or the use of misappropriated information? Such practices are extremely different from traditional insider trading as there is neither a breach of fiduciary duty nor misappropriation of inside information. The ethical issues are similar to other market segmentation and price discrimination issues, in which different prices are charged to different customers. The ability to price discriminate across segments can actually benefit large segments of the population who may receive lower prices because others, such as the high-speed traders, are paying more. The sale of faster access to information, especially by exchanges, raises additional ethical issues. There may be adverse effects on market quality that must be addressed. The moral distaste for the practice expressed by some stems from the seeming unfairness of a modern market structure that provides advantages to a small group of computerized traders. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."

Our study has important implications for the regulation of HFT; we provide recommendations for regulators in relation to market rules which have yet to be introduced, using an artificial market framework. This paper addresses the question of whether this tax leads to a reduction in HFT activities and, as a result, to deterioration or amelioration of market quality. The evidence we provide should help market regulators to better understand the role played by HFT firms as liquidity suppliers. We show that HFT liquidity is short-lived. With the implementation of tax, decreased HFT activities do not have a statistically significant impact on market volatility and market liquidity measured by bid/ask spreads, but decrease dollar volumes as a liquidity measure.

Revisiting such twentieth-century classics of the genre as Tom Wolfe’s Bonfire of the Vanities and Bret Easton Ellis’s American Psycho, this book considers that the twenty-first century is witnessing the birth of a new kind of finance novel that in the face of an ongoing economic crisis, ever more frequent market crashes, and the politics of austerity, pursues a more realist approach to the actual workings of the economy. But what kind of realism would be attuned to today’s economic reality of high-frequency trading, dominated by complex financial instruments like collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps, and digital algorithms operating at speeds faster than what human beings or computers can record? If Tom Wolfe in 1989 could still urge novelists to work harder to “tame the billion-footed beast of reality”, it seems today’s economic reality confronts us with a difference that is qualitative rather than quantitative: a new financial ontology requiring new modes of thinking and writing. Mobilizing the philosophical thought of Quentin Meillassoux in the close-reading of finance novels by Robert Harris, Michel Houellebecq, Ben Lerner and less well-known works of conceptual writing such as Mathew Timmons’ Credit, Finance Fictions argues that realism is in for a speculative update if it wants to take on the contemporary economy—an “if” whose implications turn out to be deeply political. Part literary study and part philosophical inquiry, Finance Fictions seeks to contribute to a new mindset for creative and critical work on finance in the twenty-first century. © 2018 Fordham Univvty Press.

Since they are more adaptive and heuristic, they can form quite diverse trading strategies, rather than zero-intelligence strategies or pre-specified fundamentalist or chartist strategies.

Based on our empirical findings, we develop a queuing model that captures stylized facts on the data.

We apply the queuing model in an algorithmic trading setting by considering an agent maximizing her expected utility through placing and cancelling of LOs. The agent’s optimal strategy is presented after calibrating the model to real data. A simulation study shows that for the same level of standard deviation of terminal wealth, the optimal strategy has a 2.5% higher mean compared to a strategy which ignores the effect of position, or an 8.8% lower standard deviation for the same level of mean.

The issue, however, is how these firms actually make allocation decisions in practice. Using the Gioia methodology, this paper presents evidence from interviews with HFT professionals and specialist media that suggest that these firms are capability satisficers. Capability theory is also consistent with bounded rationality and the adaptive markets hypothesis, and defines the point at which these firms reach a satisfactory solution. Thus, capability reconciles mainstream theory and the more realistic, behavioral theories based on observation of industry practice. The methodology developed can be applied to any firm that makes algorithmic decisions under uncertainty. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."

To explore the microstructure of variability of stock prices on transaction-level intra-day data and to dynamically study patterns of comovement over multiple trading days, we propose a multiple day time series biclustering algorithm (CC-MDTSB) that extends the time series biclustering algorithm (CC-TSB). For identifying biclusters within each trading day, our algorithm provides a faster alternative to the random replacement method in the CC-TSB algorithm. Moreover, our algorithm does not require prespecification of the number of biclusters for each trading day. Instead, we set a threshold on the number of stocks within the biclusters to yield an adaptive stopping criterion for multiple day analysis. An analysis of the biclusters determined over multiple trading days enables us to study the dynamic behaviour of stocks over time. We effectively estimate the comovement probability of each m-tuple of stocks conditional on the other stocks within the dynamic biclusters and propose a method to forecast comovement days using a nonparametric double exponential smoothing procedure.

Flusser’s theory highlights three aspects of technical images: they are engendered by the act of organizing particles, are produced by people who operate devices through keys, and are mediated by code, which is linear and pertains to the era of written text, which Flusser conflates with the notion of history. In this article, the argument focuses on the aspects of high-frequency trading and the blockchain that relate to the idea of images. The sections investigate how money has historically operated in the logic of Flusser’s description of symbol manipulation in relation to consciousness and temporality: from the circular time of magical consciousness to the linear time of historical consciousness, and more recently, to the non-dimensional time of post-historical consciousness. The article argues that there are two levels, or layers, in the images involved in cryptocurrencies or algorithmic trading, but only one of them is visible to the human operator or viewer, in the form of a price. The other, which indeed represents the operations in the system, is only accessible to the machines themselves.

By the early 2000s, the interbank human brokers were almost all replaced by electronic broking systems, which centralised interbank trading. From the mid-1990s, bank computers, and later other financial institutions’ ones, with algorithmic trading programs were allowed to be connected to the electronic broking computers directly. On the one hand, bank computers made the market more efficient and more liquid, eliminating market anomalies. On the other hand, high frequency trading strategies turned away human dealers. Many microstructure changes in the 2010s, such as minimum quote life and retreating from decimalisation to half pip price unit, were designed to protect human dealers. The most recent innovations in the market is the emergence of dark pools, where banks operate in-house order matching systems, that takes trading away from electronic broking systems. Although dark pools may increase efficiency by allowing netting of orders at the bank level, transparency may be a concern. Human dealers may provide heterogeneity among market participants that may prevent a potential flash crash. © Philipp Hartmann, Haizhou Huang and Dirk Schoenmaker 2018."

In this paper the idea of mixed data sampling (MIDAS) is extended from linear correlation in Colacito et al. (2011) to the more general dependence measure: copula, and a copula-MIDAS model is proposed to describe the asymmetric return-liquidity dependence of CSI 300 index futures with short-run and long-run components. Based on the skewed t copula-MIDAS model, it is found that extreme decreases in returns tend to be accompanied by extreme increases in bid-ask spreads, but extreme increases in returns may not coincide with extreme reductions in bid-ask spreads. Furthermore, the return-spread dependence consists of both short-run and long-run components, and the long-run component will influence the return-spread dependence in the next two weeks. Last, the out-of-sample forecast of liquidity risk stresses the importance of considering asymmetry and long-run trend in return-spread dependence as it enables investors to well predict liquidity risk in times of market crashes. The results imply that high frequency trading investors of CSI 300 index futures should pay more attentions to prevent the potential liquidity risk when the bid-ask spreads are widened. And investors are suggested to use the past two-week high frequency data to forecast the current return-spread dependence in liquidity risk management. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

One important change, known as price impact, relates to how trading affects prices. Price impact represents the largest cost associated with trading. Forecasting price impact is very important as it can provide estimates of trading profits after costs and also suggest optimal execution strategies. Although several models have recently been developed which may forecast the immediate price impact of individual trades, limited work has been done to compare their relative performance. We provide a comprehensive performance evaluation of these models and test for statistically significant outperformance amongst candidate models using out-of-sample forecasts. We find that normalizing price impact by its average value significantly enhances the performance of traditional non-normalized models as the normalization factor captures some of the dynamics of price impact.

While the recent advance of portfolio selection in HFT market enables to bring about more profit, it yields much contended OLTP workloads. Featuring exploiting the abundant parallelism, transaction pipeline, the state-of-the-art concurrency control (CC) mechanism, however, suffers from limited concurrency confronted with HFT workloads. Its variants that enable more parallel execution by leveraging fine-grained contention information also take little effect. To solve this problem, we for the first time observe and formulate the source of restricted concurrency as harmful ordering of transaction statements. To resolve harmful ordering, we propose PARE, a pipeline-aware reordered execution, to improve application performance by rearranging statements in order of their degrees of contention. In concrete, two mechanisms are devised to ensure the correctness of statement rearrangement and identify the degrees of contention of statements, respectively. We also study the off-line reordering problem. We prove that this problem is NP-hard and present an off-line reordering approach to approximate the optimal reordering strategy. Experiment results show that PARE can improve transaction throughput and reduce transaction latency on HFT applications by up to an order of magnitude than the state-of-the-art CC mechanism. © 2017, The Author(s)."

Turnover from HFT alone may be around 40% and 60% for the European and US equity markets, accordingly. The activity of algorithmic and high-frequency trading has also caused some concerns related to toxic liquidity in the financial market. These concerns reached their peak after the Flash Crash of 6 May 2010 in the US. After some reports of the Flash Crash reached the conclusion that what triggered the freefall was an algorithm, there were questions on whether HFT traders could induce toxic liquidity. The aim of this paper is to present sources and conditions for which toxic liquidity may arise, as well as arguments that high-frequency traders may not necessarily be the source of toxic liquidity. Not only can they be a legitimate source of natural liquidity but also toxic liquidity may actually be attributable to low frequency traders.

Experimental results demonstrate that: (a) faster financial trading agents can reduce market efficiency—a worrying result given the race towards zero-latency (ever faster trading) observed in real markets; and (b) faster agents can lead to market fragmentation, such that markets transition from a regime where humans and agents freely interact to a regime where agents are more likely to trade between themselves—a result that has also been observed in real financial markets. It is also shown that (c) realism in experimental design can significantly alter market dynamics—suggesting that, if we want to understand complexity in real financial markets, it is finally time to move away from the simple experimental economics models first introduced in the 1960s. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018."

It begins before 1960, when there was no database widely available to conduct a statistical analysis of stock price movements. This changed in the 1960s with the introduction of the Center for Research in Security Prices database. A major finding was the heavy-tailed nature of stock returns. The 1960s also brought major theoretical developments, including the martingale theory of stock price processes and the efficient market hypothesis. This hypothesis prevailed until the 1990s, when the discovery of market anomalies led to statistical arbitrage strategies. We describe the use of modern machine learning methods, such as AdaBoost and random forests, which can combine some of these strategies into an improved trading strategy. The twenty-first century was marked by the rapid evolution of electronic markets and the rise of computer-driven high-frequency trading based on computing technology, low latency access, and limit order book modeling.

Our focus is twofold: first, we are concerned with the market quality implications of a change in the minimum tick size. Second, we are interested in the implications of changes in the minimum tick size on market structure. We show that there is a large body of empirical literature that documents a decrease in transaction costs following a decrease in the minimum tick size. However, even though market liquidity increases, the incentive to provide market making activities decreases. We document a strong link between the minimum tick size regulations and the recent increase in high frequency trading activity. A smaller tick enhances the price discovery process.

It covers changes in market design, electronic trading, and investor and trader behaviors. The emergence of high frequency trading and critical events like the""Flash Crash"" of 2010 are also analyzed in depth. Using a quantitative viewpoint, this book explains how an attrition of liquidity and regulatory changes can impact the whole microstructure of financial markets. A mathematical Appendix details the quantitative tools and indicators used through the book, allowing the reader to go further independently. This book is written by practitioners and theoretical experts and covers practical aspects (like the optimal infrastructure needed to trade electronically in modern markets) and abstract analyses (like the use on entropy measurements to understand the progress of market fragmentation). As market microstructure is a recent academic field, students will benefit from the book's overview of the current state of microstructure and will use the Appendix to understand important methodologies. Policy makers and regulators will use this book to access theoretical analyses on real cases. For readers who are practitioners, this book delivers data analysis and basic processes like the designs of Smart Order Routing and trade scheduling algorithms. In this second edition, the authors have added a large section on orderbook dynamics, showing how liquidity can predict future price moves, and how High Frequency Traders can profit from it. The section on market impact has also been updated to show how buying or selling pressure moves prices not only for a few hours, but even for days, and how prices relax (or not) after a period of intense pressure. Further, this edition includes pages on Dark Pools, Circuit Breakers and added information outside of Equity Trading, because MiFID 2 is likely to push fixed income markets towards more electronification. The authors explore what is to be expected from this change in microstructure. The appendix has also been augmented to include the propagator models (for intraday price impact), a simple version of Kyle's model (1985) for daily market impact, and a more sophisticated optimal trading framework, to support the design of trading algorithms. © 2018 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

In this paper, a multiscale ensemble forecastingmodel that is based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD-ADD) is proposed to predict the carbon price sequence. First, the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is applied to decompose a carbon price sequence, SZA2013, into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and one residual. Second, the IMFs and the residual are restructured via a fine-to-coarse reconstruction algorithm to generate three stationary and regular frequency components that high frequency component, low frequency component, and trend component. The fluctuation of each component can effectively reveal the factors that influence market operation. Third, extreme learning machine (ELM) is applied to forecast the trend component, support vector machine (SVM) is applied to forecast the low frequency component and the high frequency component is predicted via PSO-ELM, which means extreme learning machine whose input weights and bias threshold were optimized by particle swarm optimization. Then, the predicted values are combined to form a final predicted value. Finally, using the relevant error-type and trend-type performance indexes, the proposed multiscale ensemble forecasting model is shown to be more robust and accurate than the single format models. Three additional emission allowances from the Shenzhen Emissions Exchange are used to validate the model. The empirical results indicate that the established model is effective, efficient, and practical in terms of its statistical measures and prediction performance. © 2018 by the authors.

Differences of opinion resulting from interpretation of complex language appear to result in more trading volume despite relatively low levels of liquidity (a negative liquidity-volume relationship), while large target rate surprises reduce trading activity (a positive liquidity-volume relationship). The dynamic changes over time, as unconventional polices are adopted by monetary authorities and, high frequency traders become more pervasive.

Firstly, by analyzing the probability distribution of the Shanghai composite index in different time intervals, we clearly find that the logarithmic change of the index presents an obvious heavy tail feature as well as non-Gaussian Levy distribution, and the return series converges to a normal distribution with the increase of the time interval, which becomes more significant especially in the falling stage of stock prices. Secondly, by calculating the autocorrelation function, we observe that unlike the return rate, the fluctuation ratio of Shanghai composite index demonstrates remarkable long memory volatility with a periodicity of about 240 min, and the autocorrelation curve in falling stage is much higher than in rising and steady stages. Thirdly, in the multi-fractal structure, the volatility of return series has significant short-term and long-term differences among three different stages of rising, steady and falling due to the effects of time limitation and liquidity of investment. Finally, the macroscopic behavior of the Shanghai composite index is relatively consistent with that of the international mature stock market, however, the corresponding microscopic characteristics demonstrate significant differences due to the fact that the Chinese capital market is strongly dependent on the macroeconomic policy, investor sentiment, and liquidity levels. It is quite remarkable that the tail distribution of mature stock market is much fatter than that of Chinese stock market because of the special control and limit mechanism of stock prices in China, which finally causes the considerably lower amplitude of price fluctuation. Moreover, it is also found that the attenuation speed of the autocorrelation function in the Chinese capital market is obviously slower than that in the mature stock market, which suggests that the behaviors of investors in Chinese stock market are more likely to be influenced by the historic exchange information. At the same time, the periodicity of autocorrelation function is actually caused by the inertia recoil of investors, which further verifies the information asymmetry of Chinese stock market. Especially, by changing the starting values of the samples, we find that the periodicity of autocorrelation function still remains the same, which indicates that the periodicity characteristic of stock price is not dominated only by the intraday pattern of trading activity. Therefore, the investors should discover the underlying rules of high-frequency data and extract more useful knowledge in order to guide their investment decisions more effectively. © 2017 Chinese Physical Society."

Subscribers must continuously interact with the pub/sub system to remove and insert subscriptions, thereby inefficiently consuming network and computing resources, and sacrificing consistency. In the aforementioned applications, we recognize that the changes in the subscriptions can follow a predictable pattern over some variable (e.g., time). In this paper, we present a new type of subscription, called evolving subscription, which encapsulates these patterns and allow the pub/sub system to autonomously adapt to the dynamic interests of the subscribers without incurring an expensive re-subscription overhead. We propose a general model for expressing evolving subscriptions and a framework for supporting them in a pub/sub system. To this end, we propose three different designs to support evolving subscriptions, which are evaluated and compared to the traditional resubscription approach in the context of two use cases: online games and high-frequency trading.

This paper applies high frequency pricing data and market microstructure methods, including the Yan and Zivot (2010) information leadership share, to estimate the proportion of price discovery occurring in wheat futures markets associated with Chicago, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and Paris. We find United States futures markets remain dominant, although the share of price discovery for the Paris market increased noticeably in 2010, coinciding with major supply shocks in Russia and Ukraine. Prior to August 2010, 91% of information about the common fundamental value of wheat was first revealed in United States futures markets in an average month.

However, with the emergence of power exchanges and despite the expansion of the research sphere in this context, this issue had not been sufficiently addressed. This is due to not only the lack of concepts in theory but also to the peculiarity of price dynamics. The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the nature of the relationship between price changes and trading volume in the Nordic power market (Nord Pool), which is one of the largest energy markets worldwide. Through statistical timing analysis of the price-volume covariation, we reconsider this joint modelling, but only settling for daily observations, which makes the specificity of this work. Contrary to most comparable works, which were based on high frequency data, we chose to omit intraday observations to circumvent the repercussion of the daily seasonality on one side and ensure more lucidity and clairvoyance to a wider horizon on the other. The empirical results go in line with our expectations and provide support for the claim that there exists a significant reciprocal causality between prices and trading volume.

Contemporary temporal infrastructures—the systems of time measurement and dissemination that subtend communication infrastructures—are based on the vibrations of caesium atoms, which act as fixed points. A focus on resolution aligns an analysis with the ways that time standards are, in practice, treated as both infrastructures and texts. High-resolution time, therefore, offers an understanding of time as a scalable resource built through contingent media practices. © 2017, Published with license by Taylor & Francis © 2017, © Dylan Mulvin."

It simultaneously introduces size, direction of trades, trading intervals, microstructure noise and jumps into state equation and observation equation, thus reflecting the permanent and transitory impact these variables have on the stock price series. Then, non-parametric outliers' detection method based on particle filters is applied for detecting jumps. In the process of filtering jumps, we can also obtain real-time estimation and updates for the microstructure parameters, volatility and state variables by using Bayesian OLS. The combination of these methods make it possible to analyze intra-day seasonality, daily pattern of jumps & cojumps and simultaneously judge how trade directions and trade volume could influence prices as time goes by. Lastly, we utilize the tick-by-tick high-frequency data for Chinese stock market in 2015 turbulent period to implement empirical analysis. Results demonstrate that the jumps hidden in high-frequency stock price series show both intra-day and daily seasonality. Also the frequency and size of jumps are closely linked to the exogenous macroeconomic information. Buy and sell orders have an asymmetric impact on stock prices and fundamental values. The sensitivity of prices to microstructure variables and noise vary depending on the market conditions, among which is larger in good market circumstances. Therefore, this new model and method can efficiently increase the price sensitivity to transactions, thus better grasping the function of stock market microstructure in price discovery process. © 2017, Editorial Board of Journal of Systems Engineering Society of China.

Following Zhou's definition, we assume the observed return Yt is the result of adding microstructure noise to the true but hidden return Xt. Microstructure noise is assumed to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.); it is also independent of Xt. When Xt is sampled from a geometric Brownian motion process to yield Yt, the Kalman filter can produce optimal estimates of Xt from Yt. However, the covariance matrix of microstructure noise and that of Xt must be known for this claim to hold. In practice, neither covariance matrix is known so they must be estimated. Our RKF, in contrast, does not need the covariance matrices as input. Simulation results show that the RKF gives essentially identical estimates to the Kalman filter, which has access to the covariance matrices. As applications, estimated Xt can be used to estimate the volatility of Xt. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Heterogenous market hypothesis (HMH) is one of the important extensions of EMH literature. HMH introduced nonlinear trading behaviors of heterogenous market participants instead of normality assumption under the EMH homogenous market participants. In this study, we attempt to explore more high-frequency volatility estimators in the HMH examination. These include the bipower, tripower, and quadpower variation integrated volatility estimates using Heterogenous AutoRegressive (HAR) models. The empirical findings show that these alternatives multipower variation (MPV) estimators provide better estimation and out-of-sample forecast evaluations as compared to the standard realized volatility.

For θ > 0, however, strategies, costs, and total transaction costs will converge towards limits that are independent of θ. We then show that the limiting strategies form a Nash equilibrium for a continuous-time version of the model with θ equal to a certain critical value θ∗ > 0, and that the corresponding expected costs coincide with the high-frequency limits of the discrete-Time equilibrium costs.

Additionally, this paper raises the question whether this tax leads to a reduction of high-frequency trading (HFT) activities and a decline in trading volume. Based on our findings we report that introduction of cancel order tax only slightly reduces HFT activities, but it significantly affects market liquidity, increases market volatility and leads to deteriorating market efficiency. We conclude that it is difficult to dissuade investors from entering into unproductive trades and eliminate negative outputs of HFT (such as price manipulations) through tax, without altering the benefits of HFT like liquidity provision and efficient price discovery.

Our approach contributes to the relevant literature in that we focus on individual stock volatilities rather than indices, we distinguish firm-specific and macroeconomic announcements, and we endogenize both the durations of announcement effects and the response patterns of equity prices. We find that our individual volatilities are affected by a systematic market effect, calendar effects, announcements related to the firms’ macroeconomic environment and announcements related to the firms’ and their competitors’ strategic dealings and commercial outcomes. We find evidence that all volatility responses are gradual with persistence horizons ranging from one to three hours, revealing a significant degree of inefficiency of the French stock market over the period.

We present a complete highly-optimized infrastructure that implements low-latency system components in C++ using High-Level Synthesis (HLS).

During the financial crisis, the jump frequency and absolute jump amplitude are higher than normality. Interestingly, in the higher volatility status, the jump frequency is more than the lower volatility state. But, the jump amplitude in the higher volatility state is lower than the lower volatility state, it may be caused by persistent trading for the investors' anticipations. Moreover, we also use the daily rate of return for each TB and TIPS to investigate systematic jump risks. On average, the market participants who hold the long-term TB and TIPS face the systematic jump risks. The investors and the issuers must require the jump risk premium against the mispricing."

Combining a review of the extant literature on high frequency trading with empirical data from interviews with financial traders, computer experts and regulators, we develop concepts of regulatory adaptation, technology asymmetry and market ambiguity to illustrate the 'dark art' of high frequency trading. Findings show high frequency trading is a multi-faceted, complex and secretive practice.

The results indicate that there is bidirectional information flow in long term, but in short term only US market is information provider. Next, VECM suggests that this long term and short term relationship between these two markets can be useful for formulating some trading strategies. And trading simulation confirm that very little profit opportunities exists on regular basis for hedgers. Both U.S. and Indian Future market are found to be efficient on daily basis, because there exist very little profit opportunity. But US Future market is found to be more efficient than the Indian Future market. © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V."

Some interesting empirical results are obtained and the corresponding explanations are given. The frequency of positive jumps is quite higher than that of negative jumps. The trading volumes and average trade sizes are all in a high level around positive jumps. The relatively low liquidities around negative jumps show that negative jumps may be generated and enlarged by poor liquidity provision. The price reversal after price jumps is significant, and price reversal lasts longer after positive jumps. Moreover, the size and direction of jumps are significantly correlated with the returns and trades in the post-jump trading time. These findings are believed to be associated with the high proportion of retail investors and their herding behavior for price trend chasing. © 2016, Institute of Systems Science, Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

This transformation was mainly driven by the regulatory induced fragmentation and by the increase of high-frequency trading (HFT). On the basis of the electronic market hypothesis, which poses that coordination costs decline when markets become automated, and the efficient market hypothesis in its semi-strong form, we study the effect of HFT on market efficiency in the European fragmented market landscape. In doing so, we further incorporate the realm of financialization, which criticizes the increase in transaction speed. By conducting a long-term analysis of CAC 40 securities, we find that HFT increases market efficiency by leveling midpoints between Euronext Paris and Bats Chi-X Europe. On the basis of a cross-country event study, we analyze the effect of the German HFT Act. We observe that the midpoint dispersion of blue chip securities between the two leading venues Deutsche Boerse and Bats Chi-X Europe increased.

The computing platform, Plham, enables modeling financial markets composed of various brands of assets and a large number of agents trading on a short timescale. The design feature of Plham is the separation of artificial market models (simulation models) from their execution (execution models). This allows users to define their simulation models without parallel computing expertise and to choose one of the execution models they need. This computing platform provides a prototype execution model for parallel simulations, which exploits the variety in trading frequency among traders, that is, the fact that some traders do not require up-to-date information of markets changing in millisecond order.

In particular, we first adapt the wild blocks of blocks bootstrap method suggested for the pre-averaged realized volatility estimator to a general class of estimators of integrated covolatility. We then show the first-order asymptotic validity of this method in the multivariate context with a potential presence of jumps, dependent microstructure noise, irregularly spaced and non-synchronous data. Our results justify using the bootstrap to estimate the covariance matrix of a broad class of covolatility estimators. The bootstrap variance estimator is positive semi-definite by construction, an appealing feature that is not always shared by existing variance estimators of the integrated covariance estimator. As an application of our results, we also consider the bootstrap for regression coefficients. We show that the wild blocks of blocks bootstrap, appropriately centered, is able to mimic both the dependence and heterogeneity of the scores. We provide a proof of construction of bootstrap percentile and percentile-t intervals as well as variance estimates in this context. This contrasts the traditional pairs bootstrap which is not able to mimic the score heterogeneity even in the simple case where no microstructure noise is present. Our Monte Carlo simulations show that the wild blocks of blocks bootstrap improve the finite sample properties of the alternative approach based on the Gaussian approximation.

The GF is to expect a negative correlation in a process that is in fact random. The HHF is more or less the opposite of this—to believe that another heads is more likely after a run of heads. The evidence for these fallacies comes largely from situations where they are not punished (lotteries, casinos, and laboratory experiments with random returns). In many real-world situations, such as in financial markets, succumbing to fallacies is costly, which gives an incentive to overcome them. The present study is based on high-frequency data from a market maker in the foreign exchange market.

To Glosten and Milgrom's original model, we add multiple securities and introduce an automated market maker who prices order flow for all securities contemporaneously.

This paper analyses high-frequency trading (HFT) as a necessary component of the infrastructure that makes financialization possible. Through interviews with HFT firms, a software vendor, regulators and banks, the effects of HFT on market efficiency, and its impact on costs to long-term investors are explored. This paper contributes to the literature by exploring the conflict that exists between HFT and traditional market makers in today's fragmented markets. This paper argues that society should be unconcerned with this conflict and should instead focus on the effects these participants have on the long-term investors, for whom the markets ultimately exist. In order to facilitate the best outcomes, regulation should be simple, aimed at keeping participants' behavior stable, and the interactions among them transparent and straightforward. Financialization and HFT are inextricably linked, and society is best served by ensuring that the creative energy of these market participants is directed on providing liquidity and removing inefficiencies. © 2017 Association for Information Technology Trust."

Therefore, a reliable method to appraise the asset performance is extremely important to portfolio managers, regulators, and individual investors. One alternative approach to achieve this goal is data envelopment analysis (DEA). Asset performance was ranked from both self- and peer-evaluation perspectives. Specifically, we extended the cross-efficiency analysis in DEA that uses row and column means to portfolio selection and identify different types of asset set.

We build and solve a dynamic model of sequential double auctions in which traders trade strategically with demand schedules. Trading needs are generated by time-varying private information about the asset value and private values for owning the asset, as well as quadratic inventory costs. We characterize a linear equilibrium with stationary strategies and its efficiency properties in closed form. Frequent trading (more double auctions per unit of time) allows more immediate asset reallocation after new information arrives, at the cost of a lower volume of beneficial trades in each double auction. Under stated conditions, the trading frequency that maximizes allocative efficiency coincides with the information arrival frequency for scheduled information releases, but can far exceed the information arrival frequency if new information arrives stochastically.Asimple calibration of the model suggests that a moderate market slowdown to the level of seconds or minutes per double auction can improve allocative efficiency for assets with relatively narrow investor participation and relatively infrequent news, such as small- and micro-cap stocks. © The Author 2017."

The Ising spin Hamiltonian was utilized as the level of 'disagreement' in describing investors' behaviour. The Ising spin directions were referred to an investor's intention to perform his action on trading his stock. The periodic economic variation was also considered via the external economic-field in the Ising model. The stochastic Monte Carlo simulation was performed on Ising spins, where the steady-state excess demand and supply as well as the stock-price were extracted via the magnetization. From the results, the economic-field parameters and market temperature were found to have significant effect on the dynamic magnetization and stock-price behaviour. Specifically, the hysteresis changes from asymmetric to symmetric loops with increasing market temperature and economic-field strength. However, the hysteresis changes from symmetric to asymmetric loops with increasing the economic-field frequency, when either temperature or economic-field strength is large enough, and returns to symmetric shape at very high frequencies. This suggests competitive effects among field and temperature factors on the hysteresis characteristic, implying multi-dimensional complicated non-trivial relationship among inputs-outputs.

Our main result gives a diffusion approximation for the mid-price process, which sheds further light on the relation between the mid-price behavior at low frequencies and some LOB features not considered in earlier works. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed framework, we also develop a feasible method to compute several quantities of interest, such as the distribution of the time span between price changes and the probability of consecutive price increments conditioned on the current state of the book. These LOB model features are relevant in many applications such as high frequency trading and intraday risk management. The proposed method is also used to develop an efficient simulation scheme for the price dynamics, which is then applied to assess numerically the accuracy of the diffusion approximation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."

The key idea is to exploit Model Predictive Control, a control-theoretic method that takes into account the system behavior over a future time horizon in order to decide the best reconfiguration to execute. We design a set of energy-aware proactive strategies, optimized for throughput and latency QoS requirements, which regulate the number of used cores and the CPU frequency through the Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) support offered by modern multicore CPUs.

Our goal is to explore the emergence of the stylized facts, when the simulated market is populated with agents using different strategies: a variation of the zero intelligence with a constraint strategy, the zero-intelligence directional-change event strategy, and a genetic programming-based strategy. A series of experiments were conducted, and the results were compared with those of a high-frequency FX transaction data set. Our results show that the zero-intelligence directional-change event agents best reproduce and explain the properties observed in the FX market transactions data.

First, the parameters of the corresponding Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) process are estimated by auto-regressive Hidden Markov Models (AR-HMM), in order to capture the underlying characteristics of the financial time series. Portfolio optimization is then performed by maximizing the return achieved with a predefined probability instead of optimizing the predictability parameter, which provides more profitable portfolios. The selection of the optimal portfolio according to the goal function is carried out by stochastic search algorithms. The presented solutions satisfy the cardinality constraint in terms of providing a sparse portfolios which minimize the transaction costs (and, as a result, maximize the interpretability of the results). In order to use the method for high frequency trading (HFT) we utilize a massively parallel GPGPU architecture. Both the portfolio optimization and the model identification algorithms are successfully tailored to be running on GPGPU to meet the challenges of efficient software implementation and fast execution time. The performance of the new method has been extensively tested both on historical daily and intraday FOREX data and on artificially generated data series. The results demonstrate that a good average return can be achieved by the proposed trading algorithm in realistic scenarios.

We borrow the concept of Social Machines from Web Science as a single concept that captures the essence of all these recent technological changes to argue that the emergence of these Social Machines has aided the transformation of financial markets and society. This study explores the formation of these Social Machines with three sample disruptive technologies - automated/high-frequency trading, social network analytics and smart mobile technology. Through critical reflective analysis of these three case studies, we assess the impact of information technology innovation on financialisation. We adopt three case studies - automated trading; market information extraction using social media technologies; and information diffusion and trader decision-making with mobile technology on financial and real sector changes - which demonstrate the increasing trend of transaction velocity, speculative trading, increased complex information network, accelerated inequality and leverage. Our findings demonstrate that technologically enabled financial Social Machines harness crowd wisdom, engage disparate individual traders to produce more accurate price estimations, and have enhanced decision-making capability. However, these same changes can also have a simultaneously detrimental effect on financial and real sectors, in some situations exacerbating underlying distortions, such as misinformation due to complex information networks, speculative trading behaviour, and higher volatility with transaction velocity. Overall, we conclude that these innovations have transformed the fundamental nature of key aspects of the finance industry and society as a whole. © 2017 Association for Information Technology Trust."

Researchers have put substantial scholarly input to deal with these anomalies. From the big data perspective, anomaly detection in financial data has widely been ignored despite many organisations store, process and disseminate financial market data for interested customers to assist them to make informed decision abd create competitive advantages. Considering the presence of anomalies in voluminous data from myriad data sources may generate catastrophic decision through misunderstandings of market behaviour. Therefore, in this study, we applied a standard set of anomaly detection techniques, used in big data based on nearest-neighbours, clustering and statistical approaches, to detect rare anomalies present within the historical daily trading information for five years (i.e., 2009-2013) for each stock listed on the Australian Security Exchange (ASX).

Outside this narrow window, general investors trade at fully adjusted prices. We further establish a causal relationship between the early peek mechanism and the fast price discovery by isolating the impact of the early peek arrangement along two dimensions. In cross section, we use other news releases without the early peek (as controls); in time series, we use the sudden suspension of the early peek arrangement in July 2013 (as the treatment). Our difference-in-difference tests directly connect the early peek arrangement to more efficient price discovery — it results in faster price discovery, lower volatility, and faster resolution of uncertainty.

Manipulations contribute to mispricing, market imperfections and an increase in transaction costs for market participants and in costs of capital for issuers. Manipulations are facilitated by increased transaction velocity, speculative trading and abusive usage of new trading technologies, i.e., they are directly linked to financial sector changes that drive financialization. Research at the intersection of financialization and IS might support regulatory authorities and market operators in improving market surveillance and helping to detect fraudulent activities. However, confusing terminology is prevalent on financial markets with respect to different manipulation techniques and their characteristics, which hampers efficient fraud detection. Furthermore, recognizing manipulations is challenging given the large number of information sources and the vast number of trades occurring not least because of high-frequency traders. Therefore, automated market surveillance tools require a comprehensive taxonomy of financial market manipulations as a basis for appropriate configuration. Based on a cluster analysis of SEC litigation releases, a review of the latest market abuse regulation and academic studies, we develop a taxonomy of manipulations that structures and details existing manipulation techniques and reveals how these techniques differ along several dimensions.

Furthermore, the market is assumed to have two populations of high-frequency traders (interpreted as minor agents) who wish to liquidate or acquire a certain number of shares within a specific time, and each one of them has partial observations of its own state and the major agent’s state (which include the corresponding inventories). The objective for each agent is to maximize its own wealth and to avoid the occurrence of large execution prices, large rates of trading, and large trading accelerations which are appropriately weighted in the agent’s performance function.

We propose a theoretical model describing the effects of stock markets fragmentation on two types of investors optimization problems: “intermediary” high-frequency and “final” investors. Volatility has a permanent and a transitory component, whose weights depend on market fragmentation via the share of non-marketable orders of intermediary investors. The trading volume of final investors depends on market fragmentation both directly via transaction costs, and indirectly via total volatility.

Its ability to extract features from a large set of raw data without relying on prior knowledge of predictors makes deep learning potentially attractive for stock market prediction at high frequencies. Deep learning algorithms vary considerably in the choice of network structure, activation function, and other model parameters, and their performance is known to depend heavily on the method of data representation. Our study attempts to provides a comprehensive and objective assessment of both the advantages and drawbacks of deep learning algorithms for stock market analysis and prediction. Using high-frequency intraday stock returns as input data, we examine the effects of three unsupervised feature extraction methods—principal component analysis, autoencoder, and the restricted Boltzmann machine—on the network's overall ability to predict future market behavior. Empirical results suggest that deep neural networks can extract additional information from the residuals of the autoregressive model and improve prediction performance; the same cannot be said when the autoregressive model is applied to the residuals of the network. Covariance estimation is also noticeably improved when the predictive network is applied to covariance-based market structure analysis.

However, these patterns are often elusive as they are affected by many uncertain political-economic factors in the real world, such as corporate performances, government policies, and even breaking news circulated across markets. Moreover, time series of stock prices are non-stationary and non-linear, making the prediction of future price trends much challenging. To address them, we propose a novel State Frequency Memory (SFM) recurrent network to capture the multi-frequency trading patterns from past market data to make long and short term predictions over time. Inspired by Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), the SFM decomposes the hidden states of memory cells into multiple frequency components, each of which models a particular frequency of latent trading pattern underlying the fluctuation of stock price. Then the future stock prices are predicted as a nonlinear mapping of the combination of these components in an Inverse Fourier Transform (IFT) fashion. Modeling multi-frequency trading patterns can enable more accurate predictions for various time ranges: while a shortterm prediction usually depends on high frequency trading patterns, a long-term prediction should focus more on the low frequency trading patterns targeting at long-term return. Unfortunately, no existing model explicitly distinguishes between various frequencies of trading patterns to make dynamic predictions in literature. The experiments on the real market data also demonstrate more competitive performance by the SFM as compared with the state-of-the-art methods. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery."

QHawkes models generalize the Hawkes price models introduced in Bacry and Muzy [Quant. Finance, 2014, 14(7), 1147–1166], by allowing feedback effects in the jump intensity that are linear and quadratic in past returns. Our model exhibits two main properties that we believe are crucial in the modelling and the understanding of the volatility process: first, the model is time-reversal asymmetric, similar to financial markets whose time evolution has a preferred direction. Second, it generates a multiplicative, fat-tailed volatility process, that we characterize in detail in the case of exponentially decaying kernels, and which is linked to Pearson diffusions in the continuous limit. Several other interesting properties of QHawkes processes are discussed, in particular the fact that they can generate long memory without necessarily being at the critical point. A non-parametric fit of the QHawkes model on NYSE stock data shows that the off-diagonal component of the quadratic kernel indeed has a structure that standard Hawkes models fail to reproduce. We provide numerical simulations of our calibrated QHawkes model which is indeed seen to reproduce, with only a small amount of quadratic non-linearity, the correct magnitude of fat-tails and time reversal asymmetry seen in empirical time series. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Drawing on interviews with and ethnographic observations of high-frequency traders, as well as HFT 'how to' books, we analyze the subjectivity and self-techniques of the ideal high-frequency trader.

However, an often overlooked definite advantage of wireless links over fiber-optic links is that waves travel at the speed of light c, which is about 50% faster than in optical fibers as shown in Fig. 17.9.1 (top left). This 'minimum latency' is crucial for applications requiring real-time responses over a long distance, including high-frequency trading [1]. Further opportunities and new applications might be created if the absolute minimum latency and fiber-optic data-rates are put together.

Based on machine learning, we classify microblogs posted on Sina Weibo, a Twitter’s variant in China into five detailed sentiments of anger, disgust, fear, joy, and sadness. Using wavelet analysis, we find close positive linkages between sentiments and the stock return, which have both frequency and time-varying features. Five detailed sentiments are positively related to the stock return for certain periods, particularly since October 2014 at medium to high frequencies of less than ten trading days, when the stock return is undergoing significant fluctuations. Sadness appears to have a closer relationship with the stock return than the other four sentiments. As to the lead-lag relationships, the stock return causes Weibo sentiments rather than reverse for most of the periods with significant linkages. Compared with polarity sentiments (negative vs. positive), detailed sentiments provide more information regarding relationships between Weibo sentiments and the stock market. The stock market exerts positive effects on bullishness and agreement of microblogs. Meanwhile, agreement leads the stock return in-phase at the frequency of approximately 40 trading days, indicating that less disagreement improves certainty about the stock market.

Yet, although intriguing, this view has been seldom quantitatively investigated − and that is the gap found in previous research. A computer simulation has been produced to mimic the behaviour of both slow and fast traders, each category showing characteristics consistent with their behaviour on the markets. In particular, High-Frequency (HF) traders show their preference for aggressive orders when the bid-ask spread is tight and are less aggressive when spread is wide. The Low-Frequency (LF) traders are then forced to live with the remaining deals, hoping to profit from longer term price movements. The purpose of this piece of research is to verify whether HF traders (HFTs) tend to deal with each other and, something not investigated by previous studies, if LF traders also mainly restrict their trading with other slow traders. The results show some tendency toward markets actually splitting into two-tiers: they confirm previous findings of HF traders' tendency to deal with their similar counterparts in case of thin bid-ask spread (which means higher probability of profits for the aggressive side), leaving mostly LF traders to deal amongst themselves when the spread is wider, so aiming at long-term gain (which makes trading inherently riskier). © 2017"

To do so, I consider market liquidity and volatility in the Italian Stock Exchange (Borsa Italiana) over the 2011–2013 period, which provides a unique opportunity for empirical assessment: first, a penalty for high order-to-trade ratios (OTR) was implemented in April 2012; second, a transaction tax on securities (STT) was introduced in March 2013 on Italian large and mid-caps; third, this tax was extended to derivatives in September 2013 (FTT). I identify causality via a difference-in-difference approach (with German firms and Italian small caps, when appropriate, as control groups) and a regression discontinuity design. I find that neither the OTR nor the STT/FTT had a meaningful impact on market liquidity or volatility. There was however a substantial drop in OTC trading. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."

Among the objectives are improvement in the quality of daily life (especially of the senior and disabled citizens), upgrading the health care, more efficient air and road traffic control, and more more effective environmental monitoring. For the last 20 years, communications were almost exclusively dedicated to military and governmental applications involving only very few users. Today there is a radical change since the trends have totally transformed as most of the applications are devoted to the civil sector. Naturally this resulted (and will continue) in a dramatic increase in the number of customers as well as in the number of applications. All these changes led to an overcrowded frequency spectrum with an ensuing and continuous increase in the value of the allocated frequencies and to a radical modification concerning the required performance of the electronic modules. For example, for general communications systems, there is a continuous tendency to smaller, secure systems that have increased functionality and reduced power consumption. However, these demands place severe constraints on circuit power dissipation and electromagnetic (EM) compatibility and significantly increase the equipment design complexity. At the same time, one key issue is emerging and this is the noise originating from the electronic modules. Today it is mandatory to realize high-frequency receivers featuring very low-noise behavior. This demand, however, is conflicting with the requirements to increase the operating frequency, to decrease the power consumption, and to boost the number of users. Furthermore, the presence of several transmitters operating simultaneously on the same platform with multiple receivers requires receivers with a very high dynamic range and special attention to the overall design of the system for optimum EM compatibility. This usually requires filtering of the transmitters to rule out interference phenomena. Furthermore, the multiplication of the standard requires from the electronic modules to have a degree of agility to optimize the communication. The receiver or the transmitter has to switch to the standard or to the operator featuring the most efficient characteristics. Similar requirements apply to the battery and performance management. Depending on the EM environment, the performance of the receiver/transmitter can be more or less relaxed to save energy, which is a key issue in the case of portable communications, where the system has to be smart enough to choose the best configuration by trading off between the electrical performance (i.e., linearity, noise figure) and the power consumption. © 2008 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Design/methodology/approach – The sample consists of 67 Chinese cross-listed firms on A-share and H-share markets out of which 18 firms are allowed to be sold short/ traded on margin since March 2010. Using pre- and post-event period, the authors compare and contrast various market microstructure variables. The contributions of the home (A-share) and overseas (H-share) markets to the incorporation of new information into prices are calculated following the permanent-transitory approach of Gonzalo and Granger (1995) as well as the adverse selection component of Lin et al. (1995). Findings – The findings indicate that for the group of Chinese cross-listed firms that are not allowed to be sold short or bought on margin, the home (A-share) market contributes more to the price discovery process over time. However, for the group of cross-listed firms that are eligible for short selling and margin trading, the authors observe no significant difference in the contribution of either A- or H-share markets to the price discovery. The contribution of home market for these firms is even lower around the announcement of major events. The authors further find that while the short sale activities appears to be informative, measured by the adverse selection (AS) component of spread, on the whole they have not led the A-share markets to be more informative. Research limitations/implications – The sample of cross-listed Chinese firms that are allowed to be sold short or bought on margin are rather limited. Hence, the results should be read with some caution. Practical implications – The removal of short selling constraints appears to improve the contribution of the respective markets to the process price discovery, in the case for larger cross-listed firms. Originality/value – The authors shed new lights on how the introduction of short selling and margin trading impacts on the price discovery of the Chinese cross-listed firms. A further contribution of the study is the use of high frequency data, while most of the previous studies on the Chinese markets use daily data. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Our main contributions are threefold. First, we characterize the distributional behavior of high-frequency asset returns both in ordinary clock time and in trade time. We show that when controlling for pre-scheduled market news events, trade-time returns of the near-month E-mini S&P 500 futures contract are well characterized by a Gaussian distribution at very fine time scales. Second, we develop a structured and parsimonious model of clock-time returns using a time-changed Brownian motion composed with a general, non-Lévy directing process. Particular cases of this model allow for leptokurtosis and volatility clustering in clock-time returns, even when trade-time returns are Gaussian. Finally, we highlight conditions for the directing process which are required in order to generate proper volatility dynamics while simultaneously matching the unconditional distribution of returns. In-sample fitting and out-of-sample realized volatility forecasting demonstrate the strength of our model relative to leading candidates. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"

While the recent advance of portfolio selection in HFT market generates more profit, it yields much contended OLTP workloads. Featuring in exploiting the abundant parallelism, transaction pipeline, the state-of-the-art concurrency control (CC) mechanism, however suffers from limited concurrency confronted with HFT workloads. Its variants that enable more parallel execution by leveraging find-grained contention information also take little effect. To solve this problem, we for the first time observe and formulate the source of restricted concurrency as harmful ordering of transaction statements. To resolve harmful ordering, we propose PARE, a pipeline-aware reordered execution, to improve application performance by rearranging statements in order of their degrees of contention. In concrete, two mechanisms are devised to ensure the correctness of statement rearrangement and identify the degrees of contention of statements respectively. Experiment results show that PARE can improve transaction throughput and reduce transaction latency on HFT applications by upto an order of magnitude than the state-of-the-art CC mechanism. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017."

A realized beta estimator from daily returns over the prior year generates the most accurate beta forecast among estimators based on daily returns. A realized beta estimator from 30-minute returns over the prior 2 months generates the most accurate beta forecast among estimators based on 30-minute returns. In environments where low-, medium- and high-frequency returns are accurately available, beta forecasting with low-frequency returns are the least accurate and beta forecasting with high-frequency returns are the most accurate.

The optimization problem takes into account the latency L of the trading algorithm, which affects the prices at which the asset is traded. The solution divides the state space into a ‘trade’ and a ‘no-trade’ region.

Skyline queries are a notable example. Their results consist of all the tuples whose attribute vector is not dominated (in the Pareto sense) by one of any other tuple. Because of their popularity, skyline queries have been studied in terms of both sequential algorithms and parallel implementations for multiprocessors and clusters. Within the Data Stream Processing paradigm, traditional database queries on static relations have been revised in order to operate on continuous data streams. Most of the past papers propose sequential algorithms for continuous skyline queries, whereas there exist very few works targeting implementations on parallel machines. This paper contributes to fill this gap by proposing a parallel implementation for multicore architectures. We propose (i) a parallelization of the eager algorithm based on the notion of Skyline Influence Time, (ii) optimizations of the reduce phase and load-balancing strategies to achieve near-optimal speedup, and (iii) a set of experiments with both synthetic benchmarks and a real dataset in order to show our implementation effectiveness.

We apply these measures to intraday, 30-second sampled prices of various stock market indices. Our results reveal intraday trends where different time-horizons contribute with variable relative amplitudes over the course of the trading day. Our findings indicate that the time series we analysed have a non-stationary multifractal nature with predominantly persistent behaviour at the middle of the trading session and anti-persistent behaviour at the opening and at the closing of the session.

In a networked world, we would like mobile devices to provide a crisp user experience and applications to instantaneously return results. Unfortunately, application performance does not depend solely on processing time, but also on a number of different components that are commonly counted in the overall system latency. Latency is more than just a nuisance to the user, poorly accounted-for, it degrades application performance. In fields such as high frequency trading, as well as in many data centers, latency translates easily to financial losses. Research to date has focused on specific contributions to latency: from improving latency within the network to latency control on the application level. This paper takes an holistic approach to latency, and aims to provide a break-down of end-to-end latency from the application level to the wire. Using a set of crafted experiments, we explore the many contributors to latency. We assert that more attention should be paid to the latency within the host, and show that there is no silver bullet to solve the end-to-end latency challenge in data centers. We believe that a better understanding of the key elements influencing data center latency can trigger a more focused research, improving the user’s quality of experience. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017."

The aim of this paper is to show that geometric phases can exist also for discrete-Time systems, and even when the cycles in shape space have zero area. A context in which this principle can be applied is stock trading. A zero-Area cycle in shape space represents the type of trading operations normally carried out by high-frequency traders (entering and exiting a position on a fast time-scale), while the phase variable represents the cash balance of a trader. Under the assumption that trading impacts stock prices, even zero-Area cyclic trading operations can induce geometric phases, i.e., profits or losses, without affecting the stock quote. © 2016 Claudio Altafini.

Considering first the results of a Vector Autoregression (VAR) using daily data, we observe that there is some evidence of causality from VIX futures to the VIX. Estimating a VAR using our ultra-high frequency data, we find strong evidence for bi-directional Granger causality between the VIX and the VIX futures. Overall, this effect appears to be stronger from VIX futures to the VIX than the other way around. Impulse response functions and variance decompositions confirm the dominance of the VIX futures. Lastly, we show that the causality from the VIX futures to the VIX has been increasing over our sample period, whereas the reverse causality has been decreasing. We observe that the VIX futures have become increasingly more important in the pricing of volatility. We further document that the VIX futures dominate the VIX more on days with negative returns, and on days with high values of the VIX, suggesting that those are the days when investors use VIX futures to hedge their positions rather than trading in the S&P500 index options. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It aims to lower fairs and raise quality of service, thereby boosting demand and social welfare. Concerns have been raised, however, regarding if effective competition is possible on such a market, allowing two or more operators to be profitable and eliminating through incentives or regulation the purchase by one operator of the others' access rights, thus restoring monopoly. In addition, the effect of competition on total welfare is unclear. The issue of how to regulate the market and conduct capacity allocation in order to maximise welfare is also as yet unanswered. Addressing these issues, the present paper studies a duopoly market through simulations. It builds on the hypothesis that competition occurs between trains with close departure times. Results indicate that total welfare increases significantly when going from profit-maximising monopoly to competition, as consumers make large gains while operators' profits fall. The way the regulator allocates departure slots has significant importance for market outcomes, including prices, frequencies and total welfare. In particular, it is possible to improve welfare by regulating the succession of departures. If trading in access rights is allowed, a would-be monopolist has incentives to buy its competitors' slots for a price they would accept. A monopolist that uses high frequency of departures as a deterrence strategy against competition increases frequency a lot compared to the profit-maximising level. © 2017 The Authors.

Whilst many former studies comparing type-1 and type-2 Fuzzy Logic Systems (FLSs) focus on error reduction or market direction accuracy, our interest is predominantly risk-adjusted performance and more in line with both trading practitioners and upcoming regulatory regimes. We propose an innovative approach to design an interval type-2 model which is based on a generalisation of the popular type-1 ANFIS model. The significance of this work stems from the contributions as a result of introducing type-2 fuzzy sets in intelligent trading algorithms, with the objective to improve the risk-adjusted performance with minimal increase in the design and computational complexity. Overall, the proposed ANFIS/T2 model scores significant performance improvements when compared to both standard ANFIS and Buy-and-Hold methods. As a further step, we identify a relationship between the increased trading performance benefits of the proposed type-2 model and higher levels of microstructure noise. The results resolve a desirable need for practitioners, researchers and regulators in the design of expert and intelligent systems for better management of risk in the field of HFT. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Among the possibles analysis, the study and forecasting of ultra-high-frequency time series is an interesting and great challenge to econometric modeling and statistical analysis due its complex behaviour. This work proposes a hybrid intelligent system to forecast ultra-high-frequency stock prices. The intelligent system is composed of a genetic algorithm (GA) that seeks the best parameters (the number of nodes in the input and hidden layers, and the training algorithm) of an artificial neural network (ANN) of type multiLayer perceptron (MLP). The proposed method called Time-delay Added Evolutionary Forecasting (TAEF) is a data-driven approach, that performs a pos-processing, where the objective is to reduce the difference between the forecasting and the actual series. The experimental study is performed using ultra-high frequency time series (Amazon, APPLE, Google and Intel stock prices) and shows that the proposed approach overcomes classical techniques of the computational intelligence and statistics in light of six relevant evaluation measures. © 2016 IEEE."

In this essay, I seek to rethink crisis theory in light of prevailing assumptions about the longevity of the contemporary liberal international order. I examine how catalysts of crises can be the effects of non-human actors that intensify or crystalize moments of instability. From global ecological feedback loops, to high-frequency trading and automated factories, the processes of production and distribution increasingly reflect global networks that transcend day-to-day human decisions.

The field of stock prediction has employed machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to forecast the behavior of the financial market and to predict stock prices. Recently, social media has evolved to incorporate a massive amount and variety of textual data. The analysis of this information furthers the mining of public sentiment and opinions about real-time trends. In addition, the study of the inherently complex social media feeds promises new opportunities to discover empirical regularities to measure economic activity and analyze economic behavior at high frequency and in real-time. However, the noisy and short nature of social media feeds mask this information: unlike structured news content, social media content is characterized by the presence of metadata related to social media sites, (e.g., hashtags for Twitter) and the extensive usage of casual language, unstructured grammar, colloquial words, ad hoc multi-token nonstandard lexical items such as acronyms and abbreviations that need situational context to be interpreted and don't fit with traditional technical analysis simply based on forecasting models. Under those purposes and in order to meet the trading challenge in today's global market, technical analysis must be reconsidered. Before using any analysis model, data need to be preprocessed and regularities must be reviewed. So, the precision of the forecasting and prediction systems of the financial market and stock prices will be optimized and improved, also the accuracy of the data analysis models will be higher than state-of-art models. In this context, this study introduces the challenges of the noisy information overload from social media, gives a brief description of stock market prediction and its methodologies. Then, we discuss some of the current methods of stock prediction methodologies and emphasis the need of new improved ones which are more adapted to the context of noisy data. Finally, we present a new approach for the financial market forecasting and prediction which uses data preprocessing and normalization from noisy data in Twitter. The strong influence of the proposed data normalization model on the proposed approach's precision and accuracy can lead to a better results than traditional ones. © Medwell Journals, 2017."

It first relates the history of mathematics to the history of financial technologies, and argues, inspired by Simmel and Marcuse, that from ancient times to now there seems to be an evolution towards increasing quantification not only in finance, accounting etc., but in modern society in general. It shows that scientific and technological changes have social and ethical consequences, as quantification creates more distance between people. The paper then analyzes and discusses current shifts of financial agency that exemplify what seems to be a moment of hyper-quantification through the use of ICTs: experiences of “the market” as an independent agent and money machines as artificial agents in high frequency trading—perhaps the only agents still able to cope with the data-loaded and hyper-quantified world we live in. Under these conditions it becomes more difficult to exercise responsibility. The paper concludes that while we must acknowledge the human character of finance and mathematics, there are real human and social consequences of quantification, in ancient times and today, for society and responsibility. It is therefore misleading to assume that financial technologies and mathematics are ethically neutral; more analysis of ethical and societal aspects is needed, also from an “outside” perspective. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017."

Low Animal Spirits was a work made in collaboration with Richard Cochrane that took its cue from the oft-mentioned loss of the referent in both language and the economy that was speculated about wildly after the economic collapse of 2007/08. It employs a high-frequency trading (HFT) algorithm written by Cochrane (a former Vice President of Goldman Sachs), and ‘deals’ in words sourced from global news feeds for virtual ‘profit’, whilst speculating on their usage. The analysis produces new phenomena in the form of speculative headlines tweeted from the twitterbot @LowAnimalSpirit. As various social productions, including news, are increasingly enmeshed within algorithmic procedures, through their production, distribution and reception, it seemed an apt moment to apply an extreme version of algorithmic operation in the form of HFT to global news production. The Associated Press twitter hack of 2013 that brought about a 1% drop in the financial market in 1 minute was displayed during the exhibition as a polished metal graphic: Breaking News–Flash Crash, and generated further investigation into high-speed algorithmic procedures that seemingly conjoin language and the economy.

To develop efficient and effective automated trading strategies, we need to understand the workings of the market and the patterns emerging as a result of the traders interactions. In this paper, we develop an adaptive Genetic Programming (GP) agent-based trading system under Intraday Seasonality Model (ISM), which is abbreviated as GP-ISM trading system. ISM is used for creating maps and visualizing the dynamic price evolution of the asset during the day. This new model permits the recognition of periodic patterns and seasonalities in the price time series and hence eliminates any unnecessary data input. We use a high-frequency dataset of historical price data from Saudi Stock Market, which enables us to run multiple market simulation runs and draw comparisons and conclusions for the developed trading strategies. The goal of our work is to develop automated computational intelligence-based strategies for real markets, and this study facilitates a more thorough understanding of a specific market's workings and constitutes the basis for further exploration into such strategies designed for the stock market. We evaluate the intelligence of the GP-ISM trading system through agent-based simulation market index trading. For comparison, we also include four other types of trading agents in this contest, namely, zero-intelligence agents, Buy-and-Hold agents, fundamental agents and technical analysis agents. As a result, GP-ISM performs the best, which provides a general framework for the further development of automated trading strategies and decision support systems. © 2017 IOS Press and the authors.

Such automated negotiation agents are already common practice in areas such as high frequency trading, and are now finding applications in do-mains closer to home, which involve not only mere financial optimizations but balanced trade-offs between multiple issues, such as cost and convenience. As a simple example, a smart thermostat controlling a heat pump could provide demand response to the electricity grid if the inconvenience is offset by the grid relieve incentives. In such situations, the agent represents a user with individual and a priori unknown preferences, which are costly to elicit due to the user bother this incurs. Therefore, the agent needs to strike a balance between increasing the user model accuracy and the inconvenience caused by interacting with the user. To do so, we require a tractable metric for the value of information in an ensuing negotiation, which until now has not been available. In this paper, we propose a decision model that finds the point of diminishing returns for improving the model of user preferences with costly queries. We present a reasoning framework to derive this metric, and show a myopi- cally optimal and tractable stopping criterion for querying the user before a fixed number of negotiation rounds. Our method provides an extensible basis for interactive negotiation agents to evaluate which questions are worth posing given the marginal utility expected to arise from more accurate beliefs. © Copyright 2017, International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (www.ifaamas.org).

The problem, however, is that most of these methods is based on daily trading data. When facing the high frequency trading data which is more powerful in short-term forecasting, these methods become incapable. Inspired by the development of Convolutional Neural Network in image recognition tasks, this paper tries to apply the Convolutional Neural Network on the high frequency financial trading data, and has achieved good results. We collect the close price of Shanghai Composite Index from 2006 to 2008 and from 2014 to 2015, about 1000 trading days in total. The frequency of the trading data is 5 min. The paper intends to forecast the stock’s future trend of the next day from historical data, namely, go up or down. First, we apply Hodrick-Prescott decomposition [1] on the original time series. The Hodrick-Prescott filter(decomposition) is a mathematical tool used in macroeconomics to separate the cyclical component ct and trend component τt from a time series. After preprocessing, the proposed method novelly transforms the time series into pictures. We apply GASF, GADF and MTF algorithm [2] on the time series respectively, forming the R, G and B channels of a picture. By transforming each of the time series into picture mode, the trading time series produces a picture library. Finally, the proposed method uses AlexNet architecture as feature extractor and classifier. The net has five convolution layers, three pooling layers, and two fully-connected layers. In data set of time series from 2006 to 2008, we choose the training data and the testing data randomly, and the proposed method can keep the accuracy at about 0.55 on the binary classification problem. In data set of time series from 2014 to 2015, we choose the last 16 training days of the data set as testing data and the accuracy can reach up to 0.60. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017."

This study aims to provide a baseline understanding of the effect of HFT on markets by using a paradigm of zero-intelligence traders and examining the resulting structural changes. Design/methodology/approach-A continuous double auction setting with zero-intelligence traders is used by adapting the model of Gode and Sunder (1993) to include algorithmic high frequency (HF) traders who retrade by marking up their shares by a fixed percentage. The simulation examines the effects of two independent factors, the number of HF traders and their markup percentage, on several dependent variables, principally volume, market efficiency, trader surplus and volatility. Results of the simulations are tested with two-way ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc tests. Findings-In the simulation results, trading volume, efficiency and total surplus vary directly with the number of traders employing HFT. Results also reveal that market volatility increased with the number of HF traders. Research limitations/implications-Increases in volume, efficiency and total surplus represent market improvements due to the trading activities of HF traders. However, the increase in volatility is worrisome, and some of the surplus increase appears to come at the expense of long-term-oriented investors. However, the relatively recent development of HFT and dearth of appropriate data make direct calibration of any model difficult. Originality/value-The simulation study focuses on the structural impact of HF traders on several aspects of the simulated market, with the effects isolated from other noise and problems with empirical data.

In this paper, I discuss how and why the Flash Crash is being invoked as a significant event in debates about high-frequency trading and algo-financial markets. I analyse the mediatization of the event, as well as the variety of eventalizations of the Flash Crash - the different ways in which the Flash Crash is being mobilized as an illustrative event. I critically discuss the impact often associated with the Flash Crash–and on that basis, inquire into why the event nonetheless attracts so much attention. I suggest that a key reason why the Flash Crash is widely discussed is that eventalizations of 6 May 2010 evoke familiar tropes about the fear of technology and the fear of herding. Finally, and given their emphasis on herding, I argue that the Flash Crash eventalizations may contribute to discussions within economic sociology about resonance in quantitative finance. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Inventory management models cannot explain the intraday variation in option spreads and depths. Instead, we show that the option liquidity measures are strongly correlated with option volatility. Increases in volatility are associated with decreases in liquidity, a finding that is in line with information asymmetry models and the derivatives hedging theory.

Design/methodology/approach: Using both linear and non-linear econometric models, this paper empirically examines the mean spillover and the volatility spillover between the CSI 500 stock index futures market and the underlying spot market. Findings: The results showed the following: the CSI 500 stock index futures market has significant one-way mean spillover effect on its spot market. The volatility in CSI 500 stock index futures market also has a significant positive spillover effect on its spot stock market, and the mean value of dynamic correlation coefficient between the two market volatility is 0.4848. The spillover effect of the CSI 500 stock index futures market on the underlying spot market is significantly asymmetric, characterized by relatively moderate and slow during the period of the markets rising, yet violent and rapid during the period of the markets falling. The findings suggest that although the stock index futures itself was not the “culprit” of Chinese stock market crash in 2015, its existence indeed accelerated and exacerbated the stock market’s decline under the imperfect trading system.

A significant research literature has emerged concerning order book evolution, focussing on characteristics of the order book such as the time series of trade prices, movements in the bid-ask spread and changes in the depth of the order book at each price point. The latter two items can be characterised as order book shape where the book is viewed as a histogram with the size of the bar at each price point corresponding to the volume of shares demanded or offered for sale at that price. Order book shape is of interest to market participants as it provides insight as to current, and potentially future, market liquidity. Questions such as what shapes are commonly observed in order books and whether order books transition between certain shape patterns over time are of evident interest from both a theoretical and practical standpoint. In this study, using high-frequency equity data from the London Stock Exchange, we apply an unsupervised clustering methodology to determine clusters of common order book shapes, and also attempt to assess the transition probabilities between these clusters. Findings indicate that order books for individual stocks display intraday seasonality, exhibit some common patterns, and that transitions between order book patterns over sequential time periods is not random. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

The mapping of the nation-wide distribution and the detection of insecticide resistance of vector mosquitoes will provide the beneficial information for forecasting of dengue and yellow fever outbreaks and effective control measures. Methodology/Principal Findings: High resistance to DDT was observed in all mosquito colonies collected in Ghana. The resistance and the possible existence of resistance or tolerance to permethrin were suspected in some colonies. High frequencies of point mutations at the voltage-gated sodium channel (F1534C) and one heterozygote of the other mutation (V1016I) were detected, and this is the first detection on the African continent. The frequency of F1534C allele and the ratio of F1534C homozygotes in Ae. aegypti aegypti (Aaa) were significantly higher than those in Ae. aegypti formosus (Aaf). We could detect the two types of introns between exon 20 and 21, and the F1534C mutations were strongly linked with one type of intron, which was commonly found in South East Asian and South and Central American countries, suggesting the possibility that this mutation was introduced from other continents or convergently selected after the introgression of Aaa genes from the above area. Conclusions/Significance: The worldwide eradication programs in 1940s and 1950s might have caused high selection pressure on the mosquito populations and expanded the distribution of insecticide-resistant Ae. aegypti populations. Selection of the F1534C point mutation could be hypothesized to have taken place during this period. The selection of the resistant population of Ae. aegypti with the point mutation of F1534C, and the worldwide transportation of vector mosquitoes in accordance with human activity such as trading of used tires, might result in the widespread distribution of F1534C point mutation in tropical countries. © 2016 Kawada et al."

These findings show that HFT gains extensive market advantages over LFT due to significant investment in advanced technological architecture. Regulators are challenged to keep pace with HFT as different priorities to the 7 V′s are given in pursuit of a short term market strategy. This research has implications for regulators, financial practitioners and investors as the technological arms race is fundamentally changing the nature of global financial markets. © 2016 Elsevier Inc."

First, idiosyncratic risk and liquidity have a highly significant impact on returns. Second, no evidence has been found for a significant relationship between systematic risk and returns. Finally, liquidity has a higher significant effect on idiosyncratic risk than systematic risk. The empirical results of the paper contribute to the previous literature in the high frequency context.

With the upsurge in restructuring of the power markets, electricity price plays a dominant role in the current deregulated market scenario which is majorly influenced by the economics being governed. In the deregulated environment price forecasting is an important aspect for the power system planning. The problem of price forecasting can be entirely viewed as a signal processing problem with proper estimation of model parameters, modeling of uncertainties, etc. Among the different existing models the artificial neural network based models have gained wide popularity due their black box structure but it too has its own limitations. In the proposed work in order to overcome the limitations of the classical artificial neural network model, generalized neuron model is used for forecasting the short term electricity price of Australian electricity market. The pre-processing of the input parameters is accomplished using wavelet transform for better representation of the low and high frequency components.

A key challenge in high-frequency market forecasting is modeling the dependency structure among stocks and business sectors, with their high dimensionality and the requirement of computational efficiency. As a group of powerful models, neural networks (NNs) have been used to capture the complex structure in many studies. However, most existing applications of NNs only focus on forecasting with daily or monthly data, not with minute-level data that usually contains more noises. In this article, we propose a novel double-layer neural (DNN) network for high-frequency forecasting, with links specially designed to capture dependence structures among stock returns within different business sectors. Various important technical indicators are also included at different layers of the DNN framework. Our model framework allows update over time to achieve the best goodness-of-fit with the most recent data. The model performance is tested based on 100 stocks with the largest capitals from the S&P 500. The results show that the proposed framework outperforms benchmark methods in terms of the prediction accuracy and returns.

An important class of models is the autoregressive Conditional Duration (ACD) model introduced by Engle and Russell (Econometrica 66:1127–1162, 1998, [22]) and its various generalizations. These models have been used to describe duration clustering for financial data such as the arrival times of trades and price changes. However, relatively few evaluation procedures for the adequacy of ACD models are currently available in the literature. Given its simplicity, a commonly used diagnostic test is the Box-Pierce/Ljung-Box statistic adapted to the estimated standardized residuals of ACD models, but its asymptotic distribution is not the standard one due to parameter estimation uncertainty. In this paper we propose a test for duration clustering and a test for the adequacy of ACD models using wavelet methods. The first test exploits the one-sided nature of duration clustering. An ACD process is positively autocorrelated at all lags, resulting in a spectral mode at frequency zero. In particular, it has a spectral peak at zero when duration clustering is persistent or when duration clustering is small at each individual lag but carries over a long distributional lag. As a joint time-frequency decomposition method, wavelets can effectively capture spectral peaks and thus are expected to be powerful. Our second test checks the adequacy of an ACD model by using a wavelet-based spectral density of the estimated standardized residuals over the whole frequency. Unlike the Box-Pierce/Ljung-Box tests, the proposed diagnostic test has a convenient asymptotic “nuisance parameter-free” property-parameter estimation uncertainty has no impact on the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic. Moreover, it can check a wide range of alternatives and is powerful when the spectrum of the standardized duration residuals is nonsmooth, as can arise from neglected persistent duration clustering, seasonality, calender effects and business cycles. For each of the two new tests, we propose and justify a suitable data-driven method to choose the finest scale-the smoothing parameter in wavelet estimation. This makes the methods fully operational in practice.We present a simulation study, illustrating the merits of the wavelet-based procedures.

Also contributing to the importance of tradability is the recent demutualization of most exchanges during the 1990s, which turned them into for-profit organizations. In fact, large issues of shares or bonds allow economies of scale, and generate experience in listing practices and trading operations, thereby enhancing the profitability of those commercially oriented stock exchanges. Thus, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are now much less attractive to these organizations, as compared to large enterprises (LEs), due to their inherent lack of liquidity and to the economies of scale.

More specifically, the reinforcement learning agent chooses the optimum level of parameters of pairs trading to maximize the objective function. Results are obtained by applying a combination of the reinforcement learning method and cointegration approach. We find that boosting pairs trading specifications by using the proposed approach significantly overperform the previous methods. Empirical results based on the comprehensive intraday data which are obtained from S&P500 constituent stocks confirm the efficiently of our proposed method. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Financial analysts have speculated that they might decrease market transparency and malfunction price discovery, and their interaction would make the situation worse. To validate speculations, artificial market simulation is a tool of study by constructing virtual markets on computers. In this research, by constructing an artificial market simulation, we analyzed how the interaction between HFTs and a dark pool impacts on the market efficiency (in the sense of price discovery) of a (lit) stock market. In simulations, two types of trader agents enter the market. A market maker agent, a representative strategy of HFTs, submit orders to the lit market. We analyzed the market maker's interest rate spread, or simply the spread, as a key parameter for their strategy. Stylized trader agents submit orders to either the lit market or the dark pool with some probability given as a parameter. The simulation results suggest that on the condition that market makers have little impact to market pricing (having a large spread), moderate use of dark pools can promote market pricing. On the other hand, on the condition that market makers have big impact to market pricing, excessive use of dark pools can inhibit market pricing, while using dark pools do not have bad influence when the rate of use is not high. On the influence of market makers, our results suggest that the bigger the impact to market pricing (a small spread), the more it can promote market pricing. © 2017, Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence.

Accordingly, each minor agent can recursively estimate the major agent's state, compute the system's mean field and thence generate the feedback control which yields the ϵ-Nash property. This PO MM LQG MFG theory was further extended in recent work (Firoozi and Caines, 2015) to major-minor LQG systems in which both the major agent and the minor agents partially observe the major agent's state. The existence of ϵ-Nash equilibria, together with the individual agents' control laws yielding the equilibria, were established wherein each minor agent recursively generates (i) an estimate of the major agent's state, and (ii) an estimate of the major agent's estimate of its own state (in order to estimate the major agent's control feedback), and hence generates a version of the system's mean field. In the current work, PO MM LQG MFG theory is applied to the optimal execution problem in the financial sector where an institutional investor, interpreted as a major agent, has partial observations of its own inventories, and high frequency traders (HFTs), interpreted as minor agents, have partial observations of the major agent's inventories. The objective for each agent is to maximize its own wealth and to avoid the occurrence of large execution prices, large rates of trading and large trading accelerations which are appropriately weighted in the agent's performance function.

Sequential quantile estimation is also known as online quantile estimation. This area is relevant to the analysis of data streams and to the one-pass analysis of massive data sets. Applications include network traffic and latency analysis, real time fraud detection and high frequency trading. We introduce new techniques for online quantile estimation based on Hermite series estimators in the settings of static quantile estimation and dynamic quantile estimation. In the static quantile estimation setting we apply the existing Gauss-Hermite expansion in a novel manner. In particular, we exploit the fact that Gauss-Hermite coefficients can be updated in a sequential manner. To treat dynamic quantile estimation we introduce a novel expansion with an exponentially weighted estimator for the Gauss-Hermite coefficients which we term the Exponentially Weighted Gauss-Hermite (EWGH) expansion. These algorithms go beyond existing sequential quantile estimation algorithms in that they allow arbitrary quantiles (as opposed to pre-specified quantiles) to be estimated at any point in time. In doing so we provide a solution to online distribution function and online quantile function estimation on data streams. In particular we derive an analytical expression for the CDF and prove consistency results for the CDF under certain conditions. In addition we analyse the associated quantile estimator. Simulation studies and tests on real data reveal the Gauss-Hermite based algorithms to be competitive with a leading existing algorithm. © 2017, Institute of Mathematical Statistics.

This is accomplished by combining technical indicators which are classified into trend indicators, countertrend indicators and other indicators, BP neural networks (BPNN) for designing Ensemble Neural Networks with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of preprocessing of input data, and fuzzy systems of responses to forecast complex time series.

The numerical inversion of this system of integral equations allows us to propose a fast and efficient method, which main principles were initially sketched by Bacry and Muzy, to perform a non-parametric estimation of the Hawkes kernel matrix. In this paper, we perform a systematic study of this non-parametric estimation procedure in the general framework of marked Hawkes processes. We precisely describe this procedure step by step.

We first show that extant work in quantifying liquidity commonality through the degree of explanatory power of the dominant modes of variation of liquidity (extracted through Principal Component Analysis) fails to account for heavy-tailed features in the data, thus producing potentially misleading results. We employ Independent Component Analysis, which both decorrelates the liquidity measures in the asset cross section, but also reduces higher order statistical dependencies. To measure commonality in liquidity resilience, we utilise a novel characterisation proposed by Panayi et al. [Market resilience, 2014] for the time required for return to a threshold liquidity level. This reflects a dimension of liquidity that is not captured by the majority of liquidity measures and has important ramifications for understanding supply and demand pressures for market makers in electronic exchanges, as well as regulators and HFTs. When the metric is mapped out across a range of thresholds, it produces the daily Liquidity Resilience Profile for a given asset. This daily summary of liquidity resilience behaviour from the vast LOB data-set is then amenable to a functional data representation. This enables the comparison of liquidity resilience in the asset cross section via functional linear sub-space decompositions and functional regression. The functional regression results presented here suggest that market factors for liquidity resilience (as extracted through functional principal components analysis) can explain between 10 and 40% of the variation in liquidity resilience at low liquidity thresholds, but are less explanatory at more extreme levels, where individual asset factors take effect. © 2015 Taylor & Francis."

We employ a simple model of latency arbitrage in which a single security is traded on two exchanges, with price quotes available to regular traders only after some delay. An infinitely fast arbitrageur reaps profits when the two markets diverge due to this latency in cross-market communication. Using an agent-based approach, we simulate interactions between high-frequency and zero-intelligence trading agents. From simulation data over a large space of strategy combinations, we estimate game models and compute strategic equilibria in a variety of market environments. We then evaluate allocative efficiency and market liquidity in equilibrium, and we find that market fragmentation and the presence of a latency arbitrageur reduces total surplus and negatively impacts liquidity. By replacing continuous-time markets with periodic call markets, we eliminate latency arbitrage opportunities and achieve further efficiency gains through the aggregation of orders over short time periods. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors."

Offer and demand of liquidity drives price formation and traders anticipate future evolutions of the orderbook. The natural framework we use is mean field game theory, a class of stochastic differential games with a continuum of anonymous players. Several sources of heterogeneity are considered including the mean size of orders. Thus we are able to consider the coexistence of Institutional Investors and high frequency traders (HFT). We provide both analytical solutions and numerical experiments. Implications on classical quantities are explored: orderbook size, prices, and effective bid/ask spread. According to the model, in markets with Institutional Investors only we show the existence of inefficient liquidity imbalances in equilibrium, with two symmetrical situations corresponding to what we call liquidity calls for liquidity. During these situations the transaction price significantly moves away from the fair price. However this macro phenomenon disappears in markets with both Institutional Investors and HFT, although a more precise study shows that the benefits of the new situation go to HFT only, leaving Institutional Investors even with higher trading costs. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

First, the presented trading strategy appears very lucrative in the Black–Scholes–Merton (BSM) framework. In fact, to such an extent that the BSM model turns out to be, in a sense, incompatible with the CAPM. Second, if one wishes to adapt these models together, then the adjustment of the consistent pricing rule (i.e. modifying state price densities) inevitably leads to some form of volatility smile, which is the main point of the paper.

Today shares shift hands within microseconds, giving rise to a form of financial geographies termed algorithmic capitalism. This notion refers to the different spatio-temporalities produced by high frequency trading, under the valuation of time. As high frequency trading accelerates financial markets, the paper examines the spatio-temporalities of automated trading by the ways in which the speed of knowledge exploitation in financial markets is not only of interest, but also the expansion between different temporalities. The paper demonstrates how the intensification of time-space compression produces radical new dynamics in the financial market and develops information rent in HFT as convertible to a time rent and a spatio-temporal rent. The final section discusses whether high frequency trading only responds to crises in microseconds or constitutes them. It argues that automated trading will not only contribute to accelerate crises, but also deepen them by the ways in which it differentiates the dynamics between financial, fixed and productive capital. © 2015 ."

Fifteen interviews with stakeholders in the Act’s implementation serve to reconstruct how regulators defined an algorithm and help pose the question of to what extent regulatory definitions and data need accurately to represent financial practices to be useful. Although tentative in its findings, the research suggests that the algorithm-tagging rule may be providing valuable signals in the noise to trade surveillance officers and having virtuous effects on the cultures of trading firms.

More precisely, we formulate the optimization problem in terms of an asymptotic expectation-error criterion. In this setting, the optimal rebalancing times are given by the hitting times of two barriers whose values can be obtained by solving a linear-quadratic optimal control problem.

The establishment of a national market system and Regulation NMS was meant to promote competition, recognizing the evolution and changing dynamics introduced by technological innovation. This evolution and governing rule set has had many positive effects in terms of competition, fee compression, tighter spread potential and volumes. Our paper identifies certain unintended consequences and complexities of the national market system including fragmentation, sub second quoting and trading, complex order types, data asymmetry, technological innovation, unique strategies and the algorithms that power them. When acting in concert, these complexities give rise to opportunities as well as emerging risks. This high-speed system can be unstable and susceptible to inherent conflicts of interest, market abuse and price shocks. These shocks can be amplified by positive feedback loops accelerating single stock declines and also posing systemic risks in time scales beyond real-time physical human comprehension and reaction times. Furthermore they can produce contagion, which we refer to as 'Flash Splashes' caused by rapid withdrawals and injections of liquidity in increasingly linked asset classes, indices, sectors and global liquidity pools. High frequency trading strategies can be both passive and aggressive and usually display risk averse and low inventory characteristics. These strategies leverage fragmentation as they create or capture informational asymmetries. They interact directly with sell side algorithms that can hide intentions, hunt liquidity and sweep the order book. These interactions create market dynamics that can benefit and challenge anyone exposed to US equity markets. Every market participant has a risk profile unique to their strategy and objective and while regulations will be enriched or revised and certain unfair practices eliminated great attention should be paid to understanding modern high speed trading risks and both the positive and negative impacts on all stakeholders. We have examined the regulations, complexities and risks to bring clarity and understanding to the current trading ecosystem for its users.

These autoregressive models exploit stylised empirical properties of volatility such as strong persistence, mean reversion and asymmetric dependence on lagged returns. While these methods can produce good forecasts, the approach is in essence atheoretical as it provides no insight into the nature of the causal factors and how they affect volatility. Many plausible explanatory variables relating market conditions and volatility have been identified in various studies but despite the volume of research, we lack a clear theoretical framework that links these factors together. This setting of a theory-weak environment suggests a useful role for powerful model induction methodologies such as Genetic Programming (GP). This study forecasts one-day ahead realised volatility (RV) using a GP methodology that incorporates information on market conditions including trading volume, number of transactions, bid-ask spread, average trading duration (waiting time between trades) and implied volatility. The forecasting performance from the evolved GP models is found to be significantly better than those numbers of benchmark forecasting models drawn from the finance literature, namely, the heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) model, the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model, and a stepwise linear regression model (SR). Given the practical importance of improved forecasting performance for realised volatility this result is of significance for practitioners in financial markets."

While the ICEs and GTAs mediate HGT autonomously, the SaPIs are dependent on specific phages. The ICEs transfer primarily their own DNA, the GTAs exclusively transfer unlinked host DNA, and the SaPIs combine the capabilities of both. Thus the SaPIs derive their importance from the genes they carry (their genetic cargo) and the genes they move. They act not only as versatile high-frequency mobilizers but also as mediators of phage interference and consequently are major benefactors of their host bacteria. Three major types of horizontal gene transfer systems use radically different strategies for gene transfer at widely varying frequencies. Integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) initiate their own transfer autonomously, staphylococcal pathogenicity islands (SaPIs) depend on helper phages, and gene-transfer agents (GTAs) generate and release tiny DNA-containing particles.GTAs and SaPIs were probably derived from prophages by complementary deletions. ICEs were probably derived from integrated conjugative plasmids by 'trading' replication for integration/excision.SaPIs interfere with their helper phages by three carefully regulated strategies to ensure high-frequency transfer.SaPIs mediate generalized transduction while in situ independently of their self-transfer.SaPIs and their relatives in Gram-positive cocci exist as cohesive and widespread families, as shown by orthology analysis of their hypothetical proteins, a method newly described for this review. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd."

HFT practices exist because a variety of new technologies have made them possible, and because financial market infrastructure capabilities have also been changing so rapidly. The U.S. markets, such as the National Association for Securities Dealers Automated Quote (NASDAQ) market and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), have maintained relevance and centrality in financial intermediation in financial markets settings that have changed so much in the past 20 years that they are hardly recognizable. In this article, we explore the technological, institutional and market developments in leading financial markets around the world that have embraced HFT trading. From these examples, we will distill a number of common characteristics that seem to be in operation, and then assess the extent to which HFT practices have begun to be observed in Asian regional financial markets, and what will be their likely impacts.

As time goes by, the trader learns from changes in prices and updates their predictions to tweak their strategy. Compared to a trader who cannot learn from market dynamics or from a view of the market, the algorithmic trader's profits are higher and more certain. Even though the trader executes a strategy based on a directional view, the sources of profits are both from making the spread as well as capital appreciation of inventories. Higher volatility of prices considerably impairs the trader's ability to learn from price innovations, but this adverse effect can be circumvented by learning from a collection of assets that comove.

It is therefore important to develop and test alternative technologies that can fulfil the requirements of all parties in the wood fuel trading chain and provide real-time, accurate and representative MC measurements. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of a commercial high-frequency (HF) technology (originally developed to analyse potting soils) as a tool for determining the MC of comminuted solid biofuels. The measurements obtained using the HF technology were compared to measurements obtained using the gravimetric method from the European standard EN 14774-2:2009. The HF measurements were most accurate for feedstocks with homogeneous particle size distributions such as wood chips, sawdust and peat [root mean square error (RMSE) 3.1–4.5%]. Less accurate results were achieved for wood fuels with large particles and gaps between particles, such as crushed stem wood (RMSE 8.4%). If the system was adapted to improve its performance for heterogeneous particle size distributions, it should yield acceptably accurate MC estimates. Because of its potential in online analysis, it should therefore be regarded as a potential alternative to existing methods for MC measurement and merits further investigation. © 2014 Taylor & Francis."

Under the assumption that each return is an event that triggers momentum and reversal periodically, we decompose each future return into a collection of decaying cosine waves that are functions of past returns. Under realistic assumptions, we reach an analytical expression of the nonlinear relationship between past and future returns and introduce a new kernel for forecasting future returns accordingly. Using high-frequency prices of Chinese CSI 300 index from January 4, 2010, to March 3, 2014, as empirical data, we have the following observations: (1) the new kernel significantly beats the radial basis function kernel and the sigmoid function kernel out-of-sample in both the prediction mean square error and the directional forecast accuracy rate. (2) Besides, the capital gain of a simple trading strategy based on the out-of-sample predictions with the new kernel is also significantly higher.

It shows that securities markets are dominated by a cohort of ""structural insiders,"" namely a set of traders able to utilize close physical and informational access to trade at speeds measured in milliseconds and microseconds, a practice loosely termed high frequency trading (HFT). By virtue of speed and physical proximity to exchanges, these HFT traders can systematically gain frst access to new information, trade on it, and change prices before the rest of the market can see its content. This Article makes three contributions. First, it introduces and develops the concept of structural insider trading. Securities markets increasingly rely on automated traders utilizing algorithms- or pre-programmed electronic instructions-for trading. Policy allows traders to enjoy important structural advantages: (i) to physically locate on or next to an exchange, shortening the time it takes for information to travel to and from the marketplace; and (ii) to receive feeds of richly detailed data directly to these co-located trading operations. With algorithms sophisticated enough to respond instantly and independently to new information, co-located automated traders can receive and trade on not-fully-public information ahead of other investors. Indeed, by the time that the rest of the market sees this information, it has long since become out-of-date. Secondly, this Article shows that structural insider trading exhibits harms that are substantially similar to those regulated under conventional theories of corporate insider trading. Structural insiders place other investors at a persistent informational disadvantage. Through their frst sight of marketmoving data, structural insiders can capture the best trades and Erode the profts of informed traders, reducing their incentives to participate in the marketplace. Despite the similarity in harms, however, this Article shows that current doctrine does not apply to restrict structural insider trading. Rather, structural insiders thrive in full public view, and with regulatory permission. Thirdly, this Article explores the implications of structural insider trading for the theory and doctrine of insider trading. It shows them to be increasingly incoherent in their application. In protecting investors against one set of insiders but not another, law and policy appear under profound strain in the face of innovative markets."

Drawing on Henri Lefebvre's rhythmanalysis, we show how traders seek to calibrate their bodily rhythms to those of the market. We argue that, in the case of early-20th-century open-outcry trading pits, traders tried to enact a total merger of bodily and market rhythms. We also demonstrate how, in the 1920s and '30s, market observers began to respond to a widely perceived problem, namely that market rhythms might be contagious and that some form of separation of bodily and market rhythms might therefore be needed. Finally, we show how current high-frequency trading, despite being purely algorithmic, does not render the traders' bodies irrelevant.

However, the cost of the parallelization process of existing applications is still too high in terms of time-to-development, and often requires a large effort and expertise by the programmer. The REPARA methodology consists in a systematic way to express parallel patterns by annotating the source code using C++11 attributes transformed automatically in a target parallel code based on parallel programming libraries (e.g. FastFlow, Intel TBB). In this paper we apply this approach in the parallelization of a real high-frequency trading application. The description shows the effectiveness of the approach in easily prototyping several parallel variants of the same code. We also propose an extension of a REPARA attribute to express a user-defined scheduling strategy, which makes it possible to design a high-throughput and low-latency parallelization of our code outperforming the other parallel variants in most of the considered test-cases. © 2015 IEEE."

Our main goal is to investigate whether high-frequency trading exacerbates market volatility and generates flash crashes. In the model, low-frequency agents adopt trading rules based on chronological time and can switch between fundamentalist and chartist strategies. By contrast, high-frequency traders activation is event-driven and depends on price fluctuations. High-frequency traders use directional strategies to exploit market information produced by low-frequency traders. Monte-Carlo simulations reveal that the model replicates the main stylized facts of financial markets. Furthermore, we find that the presence of high-frequency traders increases market volatility and plays a fundamental role in the generation of flash crashes. The emergence of flash crashes is explained by two salient characteristics of high-frequency traders, i.e., their ability to i. generate high bid-ask spreads and ii. synchronize on the sell side of the limit order book.

Indeed, the speed at which trades are executed and data transmitted is accelerating, and it is fair to say that algorithms are now the primary interacting agents operating in the financial markets. However, we contend that HFT is first and foremost a cultural phenomenon. More specifically, both individuals and collective agents – such as algorithms – might be considered cultural entities, charged with very different ways of processing information, making sense of it and turning it into knowledge and practice. This raises issues relating to situated knowledge, distributed cognition and action, the assignment of responsibility when regulating high-speed algorithms, their history, organizational structure and, perhaps more fundamentally, their representation. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

The latter are modeled using a DCC-GARCH specification. We suggest estimating the model by composite maximum likelihood which is sufficiently flexible to be applicable in high dimensions.

We recover risk aversion empirically around the 2007 crisis using two different Risk-Neutral densitiy estimation approaches and for different options maturities. We studied simultaneously the impacts of the time-to-maturity, the risk-neutral density estimation model and the time periods of the study on the risk aversion function. Our findings show that the estimated risk-aversion functions that we compute from both mixture of log-normals and jump diffusion models for different maturities and three time periods are unfortunately not positive and monotonically downwards sloping as suggested by the standard assumptions of the economic theory. We note also that the values of the risk aversion are very close to that reported by studies based on consumption data. Moreover, for the three chosen trading days, if we change the time-to-maturity, we note that the risk aversion function shape is not affected for both one and two months maturities which corroborates the findings of Jackwerth (2000) but for the three months maturity, the risk aversion function shape is clearly affected and the U-shaped pattern is more pronounced for the longer maturities. Furthermore, we find that whatever the chosen trading date is, if we have the same time-to-maturity, we keep the same shape of the curve as well as the risk aversion function shape is not substantially affected if we extract the RND from a jump diffusion model or a mixture of log-normals model mainly for the short time-to-maturities. Compared to the time-to-maturity impact on the implied risk aversion, the selected RND model impact is less significant. A noteworthy finding is that the variation interval of the implied risk aversion on the postcrisis, when the market trend is upward, is more remarkable and large than the precrisis and postcrisis for the long-run maturity. Concluding, the risk aversion response is asymmetric depending on the Risk-Neutral density, time to maturity options and the period of study. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.."

Design/methodology/approach – International cross-country studies on stock market liquidity are categorized and reviewed. Important relevant single-country studies are also discussed. Findings – Market liquidity is influenced by exchange characteristics (e.g. the presence of market makers) and regulations (e.g. short-sales constraints). The literature has identified the most appropriate liquidity measures for global research, and for emerging and frontier markets, respectively. Major empirical facts are as follows. Liquidity co-varies within and across countries. Both the liquidity level and liquidity uncertainty are priced internationally. Liquidity is positively associated with firm transparency and share issuance, and negatively related to dividends paid out. The impact of internationalization on liquidity is not universal across firms and countries. Some suggested areas for future studies include: dark pools, high-frequency trading, commonality in liquidity premium, funding liquidity, liquidity and capital structure, and liquidity and transparency. Research limitations/implications – The paper focusses on international stock markets and does not consider liquidity in international bond or foreign exchange markets.

The answer to the second question is that when we apply a unit root test that allows for heteroskedasticity and two structural breaks, natural gas spot and futures prices are predictable. We then simulate a contrarian trading strategy for spot and futures prices to show under what circumstances trading in spot and futures prices are also profitable. The results point to the need to accommodate heteroskedasticity when applying unit root tests to model energy spot and futures prices with high-frequency data, such as daily data. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."

Our control strategies are designed to address latency constraints, using Queueing Theory models, and energy consumption by changing the number of used cores and the CPU frequency through the Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) support available in the modern multicore CPUs. The proactive capabilities, in addition to the latency-and energy-awareness, represent the novel features of our approach. To validate our methodology, we develop a thorough set of experiments on a high-frequency trading application.

Within this model, order flows are described by doubly stochastic Poisson processes (also called Cox processes) taking account of the stochastic character of the intensities of order flows. The models for the number of order imbalance (NOI) process and order flow imbalance (OFI) process are introduced as two-sided risk processes that are special compound Cox processes. These processes are sensitive indicators of the current state of the limit order book since time intervals between events in a limit order book are usually so short that price changes are relatively infrequent events. Therefore price changes provide a very coarse and limited description of market dynamics at time micro-scales. NOI and OFI processes track best bid and ask queues and change much faster than prices. They incorporate information about build-ups and depletions of order queues and they can be used to interpolate market dynamics between price changes and to track the toxicity of order flows. The proposed multiplicative model of stochastic intensities makes it possible to analyze the characteristics of the order flows as well as the instantaneous proportion of the forces of buyers and sellers without modeling the external information background. The proposed model gives the opportunity to link the micro-scale high-frequency dynamics of the limit order book with the macroscale models of stock price processes of the form of subordinated Wiener processes by means of limit theorems for special random sums and hence, to give a deeper insight in the nature of popular models of statistical regularities of the evolution of characteristics of financial markets such as generalized hyperbolic distributions and other normal variance-mean mixtures. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Larger levels of price impact are more likely to occur during the middle of the trading day, specifically the four-hour period between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m., than during the first or final hours. Purchase block trades induce a relatively smaller price impact on price run-up, while sell block trades exhibit a larger price impact on price run-up. We conclude that block trades on the ECX induce less price impact than in equity or conventional futures markets, and that a significant proportion of the effects contradict findings on block trades in those markets; thus, we provide the first evidence of the curious bent to block trading in the European Union emissions trading scheme. © 2014 Taylor & Francis."

Identifying and understanding the impact of algorithmic trading on financial markets has become a critical issue for market operators and regulators. Advanced data feeds and audit trail information from market operators now allow for the full observation of market participants’ actions. A key question is the extent to which it is possible to understand and characterize the behaviour of individual participants from observations of trading actions. In this paper, we consider the basic problems of categorizing and recognizing traders (or, equivalently, trading algorithms) on the basis of observed limit orders. These problems are of interest to regulators engaged in strategy identification for the purposes of fraud detection and policy development. Methods have been suggested in the literature for describing trader behaviour using classification rules defined over a feature space consisting of summary trading statistics of volume and inventory, along with derived variables that reflect the consistency of buying or selling behaviour. Our principal contribution is to suggest an entirely different feature space that is constructed by inferring key parameters of a sequential optimization model that we take as a surrogate for the decision-making process of the traders. In particular, we model trader behaviour in terms of a Markov decision process. We infer the reward (or objective) function for this process from observations of trading actions using a process from machine learning known as inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). The reward functions learned through IRL then constitute a feature space that can be the basis for supervised learning (for classification or recognition of traders) or unsupervised learning (for categorization of traders). Making use of a real-world data-set from the E-Mini futures contract, we compare two principal IRL variants, linear IRL and Gaussian Process IRL, against a method based on summary trading statistics. Results suggest that IRL-based feature spaces support accurate classification and meaningful clustering. Further, we argue that, because they attempt to learn traders’ underlying value propositions under different market conditions, the IRL methods are more informative and robust than the summary statistic-based approach and are well suited for discovering new behaviour patterns of market participants. © 2015 Taylor & Francis."

The order placement decision is given by an optimization problem which minimizes the risk adjusted execution cost, taking into consideration relevant market microstructure factors and intrinsic agent characteristics. This order submission process is more realistic than has been done previously and contributes to a higher fidelity of the intraday market dynamics. The results show that, as opposed to random submission strategies, high-frequency stylized facts such as the concave shape of the market price impact function and the power-law decaying relative price distribution of off-spread limit orders are replicated. Therefore, the resulting model can be used as a realistic test environment for high-frequency trading strategies, in the context of the current, heated debate over the impact of high-frequency trading. Not only the impact of individual trading strategies can be analyzed, but also the interdependencies and the global emergent behavior of multiple coexistent strategies. Moreover, innovative regulatory policies, which have not been tested yet under real market conditions, could be inspected. © 2015 IOS Press and the authors."

We developed a feature-enhancing procedure motivated by statistical surveillance approaches to strengthen the ability to capture emerging trends. We evaluated our feature-enhancing procedure by developing models to predict stock returns in the following 20-minute period. A comparison of experimental results with baseline models shows that our feature-enhancing design helped to predict stock movements. The model (SE-CUSUM) that adopted features enhanced by cumulative sum (CUSUM), a statistical surveillance approach, performed better than baseline models in terms of directional accuracy, balanced error rate, root mean square error, and mean absolute error. Our simulated trading also showed that SE-CUSUM realized a higher profit than the baseline approaches.

In this paper, the Complementary Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (CEEMD) method is used to decompose the sequences of Chinese stock index futures prices into residue terms, low-frequency terms, and high-frequency terms to reveal the fluctuation characteristics over different time scales of the sequences. Then, the CEEMD method is combined with the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to forecast Chinese stock index futures prices. The empirical results show that the residue term determines the long-term trend of stock index futures prices. The low-frequency term, which represents medium-term price fluctuations, is mainly affected by policy regulations under the analysis of the Iterated Cumulative Sums of Squares (ICSS) algorithm, whereas short-term market disequilibrium, which is represented by the high-frequency term, plays an important local role in stock index futures price fluctuations. In addition, in forecasting the daily or even intraday price data of Chinese stock index futures, the combination prediction model is superior to the single SVM model, which implies that the accuracy of predicting Chinese stock index futures prices will be improved by considering fluctuation characteristics in different time scales. © 2016 Ruoyang Chen and Bin Pan."

The applications are (i) a hybrid genetic programming and particle swarm optimisation approach for high-frequency trading, with fitness function evaluation accelerated by FPGA; (ii) an adaptive point process model for currency trading, accelerated by FPGA hardware; (iii) an adaptive line arbitrator synthesising high-reliability and low-latency feeds from redundant data feeds (A/B feeds) using FPGA hardware. Finally, we describe in more detail a generic optimisation approach for reconfigurable designs automating design optimisation, using reconfigurable hardware to speed up the optimisation process, applied to applications including a quadrature-based financial application. In each application, the hardware-accelerated self-aware approaches give significant benefits: up to 55× speedup for hardware-accelerated design optimisation compared to software hill climbing. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."

Current summarization and event matching mechanisms based on subscription subsumption induce heavy event processing load on brokers degrading the performance of CPSNs especially under high rates of churn, i.e., addition, deletion, or modification of subscriptions. Yet, many modern CPS applications such as location-based services or algorithmic trading inherently rely on high frequency subscription changes. This paper describes Beretta, a dynamic CPSN which sustains high throughput and low event-propagation latencies even under a high frequency of subscription changes. Beretta leverages strong event typing and represents all subscriptions in a normalized form as combinations of value intervals and set inclusions without compromising on expressiveness. Beretta's 'split and subsume' broker algorithm reduces the complexity of matching an event from O(KN) to O(Klog ,N+|result|), with N being the number of subscriptions for the event type and K the number of its attributes. Event types and normalization are exploited to split subscriptions into predicates on individual event types and attributes and to efficiently regroup these in segment trees and hash maps which yield excellent subsumption properties and support attribute-wise split filtering during event matching. Normalization enables the systematic introduction of parameters into subscriptions to support both parametric and structural updates. This paper also empirically demonstrates the performance improvements due to our techniques through realistic algorithmic trading and highway traffic monitoring benchmarks. © 1990-2012 IEEE."

Technologically induced innovations such as electronic exchanges, high frequency trading (HFT) and exchange traded funds (ETFs) have made trading in capital markets faster, cheaper and more integrated, yet at the same timemarket liquidity has become more fragmented and opaque. Further, there are concerns that this new paradigmleads to greater volatility and myopia in the core function of finance (raising capital for entrepreneurial activity). Capital markets are clearly complex adaptive techno-social systems that are undergoing dramatic changes yet they are rarely researched from an innovation research or technological change perspective. In this editorial, we introduce the themes and issues highlighted by the papers in this Special Issue that addresses this gap in the literature. The contributions illuminate the technologies and related innovations that are changing the nature of capital markets. However, technology cannot be seen in isolation fromother forces, most notably regulation, organisational innovation and new entrants.Moreover, technology is not only changing existingmarkets, it is expanding the scope of markets. Thuswe conclude that financialization (the process bywhich financialmarkets become increasingly important in the economy and society) is a technology enabled phenomenon-something hitherto largely overlooked by the financialization literature. © 2015 Elsevier Inc."

In social studies of finance (SSF) literature imitation is considered a strategic act, i.e. imitation is a term applied when traders copy the strategies of other traders. I wish to turn this relation between ignorance and imitation on its head and consider ignorance itself as a strategic unknown and investigate the kinds of imitations that might be produced from structures of not-knowing (i.e. structures intended to divide, obscure and protect knowledge). This point is illustrated through ethnographic studies and interviews within five HFT firms. The data show how a black-box structure of ignorance is replicated within the organizational setting of these firms and re-enacted by the traders.

Instead of the continuous limit order book market design that is currently predominant, we argue that financial exchanges should use frequent batch auctions: uniform price double auctions conducted, for example, every tenth of a second. That is, time should be treated as discrete instead of continuous, and orders should be processed in a batch auction instead of serially. Our argument has three parts. First, we use millisecond-level direct-feed data from exchanges to document a series of stylized facts about how the continuous market works at high-frequency time horizons: (i) correlations completely break down; which (ii) leads to obvious mechanical arbitrage opportunities; and (iii) competition has not affected the size or frequency of the arbitrage opportunities, it has only raised the bar for how fast one has to be to capture them. Second, we introduce a simple theory model which is motivated by and helps explain the empirical facts. The key insight is that obvious mechanical arbitrage opportunities, like those observed in the data, are built into the market design-continuous-time serial-processing implies that even symmetrically observed public information creates arbitrage rents. These rents harm liquidity provision and induce a never-ending socially wasteful arms race for speed. Last, we show that frequent batch auctions directly address the flaws of the continuous limit order book. Discrete time reduces the value of tiny speed advantages, and the auction transforms competition on speed into competition on price. Consequently, frequent batch auctions eliminate the mechanical arbitrage rents, enhance liquidity for investors, and stop the high-frequency trading arms race. © The Author(s) 2015.

In the field of high-frequency trading (HFT), suggested solutions have involved a call for increased market information, for example, or better access to the inner workings of algorithmic trading systems. Through a combination of fieldwork conducted in HFT firms and discourse analysis, I show that the problem may not always stem from a lack of information. Instead, my comparative analysis of different market actors (regulators, market analysts and traders) shows that the diverse and complex ways in which they access and construct knowledge out of information in fact lead to what I call different epistemic regimes. An understanding of how epistemic regimes work will enable us to explain not only why the same market event can be viewed as very different things – as market manipulation, predation or error – but also why it is so difficult to arrive at a unified theory or view of HFT.

However, uncertainty regarding the ideal neural targets remains, and the eventuality of so far undocumented but possible negative long-term effects on personality fuels the debate about the ethical implications of DBS. Methods In this prospective open-label trial, eight patients (three female, five male) 19–56 years old with severe and medically intractable TS were treated with high-frequency DBS of the ventral anterior and ventrolateral motor part of the thalamus. To assess the course of TS, its clinical comorbidities, personality parameters, and self-perceived quality of life, patients underwent repeated psychiatric assessments at baseline and 6 and 12 months after DBS onset. Results Analysis indicated a strongly significant and beneficial effect of DBS on TS symptoms, trait anxiety, quality of life, and global functioning with an apparently low side-effect profile. In addition, presurgical compulsivity, anxiety, emotional dysregulation, and inhibition appeared to be significant predictors of surgery outcome. Conclusions Trading off motor effects and desirable side effects against surgery-related risks and negative implications, stimulation of the ventral anterior and ventrolateral motor part of the thalamus seems to be a valuable option when considering DBS for TS. © 2016 Society of Biological Psychiatry"

These human answers reverse the usual framework of competition between high-frequency traders (HFTs) and low frequency traders (LFTs) and also widen this cadre to HFTs algos (predators) versus execution algos.This survey notes that a continuous increase in competition, between high-speed trading algorithms themselves through predatory strategies and from professional human traders adapting and building adequate responses has made the business more difficult and has led to shrinking profits for HFT. In the end, we believe that excessive competition and a change in the current regulation (favorable to HFT) could kill the goose that laid the golden egg. © 2015 Elsevier B.V."

We give a deeper analysis of current main-stream IMDB systems performance which focuses on the data structure, architecture, volume, concurrency, availability and scalability. The V3 performance model is proposed to evaluate the Velocity, Volume and Varity of the 19 IMDB systems, in order to highlight the candidates with realtime transaction and high volume processing capacity coordinately.

Recent results indicate that the market timing approach beats many traditional buy-and-hold approaches in most of the short-term trading periods. Genetic programming (GP) was used to generate short-term trade rules on the stock markets during the last few decades. However, few of the related studies on the analysis of financial time series with genetic programming considered the non-stationary and noisy characteristics of the time series. In this paper, to de-noise the original financial time series and to search profitable trading rules, an integrated method is proposed based on theWavelet Threshold (WT) method and GP. Since relevant information that affects the movement of the time series is assumed to be fully digested during the market closed periods, to avoid the jumping points of the daily or monthly data, in this paper, intra-day high-frequency time series are used to fully exploit the short-term forecasting advantage of technical analysis. To validate the proposed integrated approach, an empirical study is conducted based on the China Securities Index (CSI) 300 futures in the emerging China Financial Futures Exchange (CFFEX) market.

With the development of information systems, more people are involved in negotiations with financial instruments, particularly in the form of electronic trading. Financial markets have become a source of high-frequency data. To understand and predict future market developments, the use of high-frequency data has required greater attention and research, both in academia, and financial institutions. The models for high-frequency data, follow the concepts of autoregressive conditional duration models (ACD) created by Engle and Russell (1998). These models belong to the class of duration models. The ACD model is a duration model with time-series characteristics, since it combines features of duration models with the specifications of ARCH-type time series. The high-frequency data was obtained from the BM&FBOVESPA. For the construction of statistical models and variants of ACD was chosen using the data of the company Petrobras, which the database is coded PETR3. The results show that the Burr-ACD model contains the EACD and WACD models as special cases. While the Burr-ACD model requires more effort for implementation and assessment than the standard ACD models, the advantage is that the conditional density and survival function of the durations of transactions in the Burr-ACD model are less restrictive and can take more realistic forms. © 2015 Mauri Aparecido de Oliveira et al."

Specifically, we address the question as to whether decisions to open or close a position are different when investors already hold a position compared with when they do not. Based on a unique data set from an electronic foreign exchange trading platform, OANDA FXTrade, we find that investors' future order flow is (significantly) driven by past price movements and that these predictive patterns last up to several hours. This observation clearly shows that for high-frequency trading, investors rely on previous price movements in making future investment decisions.We provide clear evidence that market and limit orders flows are much more predictable if those orders are submitted to close an existing position than if they are used to open one.

Since the impedance balance technique has the advantage of effectively suppressing low-frequency common-mode EMI, and the filter technique can easily suppress high-frequency common-mode EMI, both the techniques are combined to reduce the common-mode EMI of the GaN boost converter. The GaN high electron mobility transistor is used to build power circuit, then a coupled inductance is used to replace the inductance of power circuit, and a capacitance is added in the output of the coupled inductance to balance the parasitic parameters. Finally, a common-mode inductor is used to suppress the high-frequency common-mode EMI, and the filter inductance is reasonably chosen by trading off between the EMI reduction and circuit area. The hybrid method not only suppresses the high-frequency common-mode EMI more effectively than the impedance balance technique does, but also occupies less circuit area than the filter technique does. Simulation results show that the hybrid method leads to a 40-60 dB reduction of the common-mode EMI in the range of 200 kHz-10 MHz and a 80 dB reduction in the range of 10-30 MHz. © 2016, Editorial Office of Journal of Xi'an Jiaotong University.

The bivariate Student's t-distribution as well as the bivariate normal distribution are used for the return distribution. The out-of-sample results show that the BREG model outperforms the DCC-EGARCH model and the OLS approach using daily returns for a short hedge in the period without unpredictably large fluctuations in returns such as the Lehman aftermath and the economic impact of the Great East Japan Earthquake. The BREG model with a Student's t-distribution is likely to be superior to that with a normal distribution. The use of RCMs with methods reducing bias induced by microstructure noise and non-synchronous trading improves the performance. We also find that the joint model of returns and RCM such as the BREG model yields better performance for a short hedge than a model in which RCM is included as an exogenous variable. © 2015 Elsevier Inc."

One natural question, which has begun to spur the development of new models, is the effect of competition between platforms that use these two different mechanisms when agents can strategize over platform choice. In this paper we contribute to this nascent literature by developing an agent-based model of competition between a Call market and a CDA market. Our model incorporates patient informed traders (both high-frequency and not) who are willing to wait for order execution at their preferred price and impatient background traders who demand immediate execution. We show that there is a strong tendency for the Call market to absorb a significant fraction of trade under most equilibrium and approximate-equilibrium conditions. These equilibria typically lead to significantly higher welfare for the background traders, an important measure of social value, than the operation of an isolated CDA market.

We use a number of different specifications of the Heterogeneous Autoregressive (HAR) model to identify an optimal way to incorporate this additional information. We evaluate the forecasting performance of 45 ASX 200 stocks, categorized in three groups based on their annual total trading volumes, three Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) indices and the S&P/ASX 200 index using a rolling estimation method. Our empirical analysis of the ASX constituents confirms the usefulness of using pre-open volatility of the same asset and realized volatilities of related assets from other markets when the ASX is closed for forecasting future volatility. Furthermore, we find that the predictive power of overnight information for all stocks and indices is higher during the market opening period and declines gradually over the trading day. However, the decrement is steeper for active stocks, suggesting that the predictive power is higher for inactively traded stocks. Finally, we evaluate the economic significance of the augmented HAR model that includes realized volatilities of related assets from other markets, and we find that it provides significant utility gains to a typical mean-variance investor. © 2015 Elsevier B.V."

Consequently, TCP/IP offload is becoming increasingly popular with standard network interface cards. TCP/IP Offload Engines have also emerged for FPGAs, and are being offered by vendors such as Intilop, Fraunhofer HHI, PLDA and Dini Group. With the target application being high-frequency trading, these implementations focus on low latency and support a limited session count. However, many more applications beyond high-frequency trading can potentially be accelerated inside an FPGA once TCP with high session count is available inside the fabric. This way, a network-attached FPGA on ingress and egress to a CPU can accelerate functions such as encryption, compression, memcached and many others in addition to running the complete network stack. This paper introduces a novel architecture for a 10Gbps line-rate TCP/IP stack for FPGAs that can scale with the number of sessions and thereby addresses these new applications. We prototyped the design on a VC709 development board, demonstrating compatibility with existing network infrastructure, operating at full 10Gbps throughput full-duplex while supporting 10,000 sessions.

This latter treatment, which we refer to as the ‘tools of coordination’ approach, sees technologies as mediators of market behavior that promote standardization and coordination. While this may be one important function of some technologies, taking a cultural approach to studying financial technologies highlights other important aspects of financial activity – in particular profit making. Instead of focusing primarily on how technologies coordinate market behavior, we focus on how technologies enable profit-making practices, in particular arbitrage. In two different case studies, one examining arbitrage between stock exchanges during the late nineteenth century and the other focusing on contemporary high-frequency trading, we employ the cultural approach to technology. We find that while new technologies do eventually promote greater coordination in financial markets, they are initially deployed for the opposite purpose, to produce what we call network differentials that allow some to profit at the expense of others. © 2015 Taylor & Francis."

We propose a Local News Sentiment Level model, based on the Local Level model of Durbin and Koopman [Time Series Analysis by State Space Methods, 2001], to construct a running series of news sentiment from irregularly observed news items’ sentiments. We construct several return and variation measures to proxy for the fine dynamics of the natural gas futures prices. We employ event studies, Granger causality tests and several state-of-the-art volatility models to assess the effect of news on the returns, price jumps and the volatility. We find significant relationships between news sentiment and the dynamic characteristics of natural gas futures prices. Our findings are, among others, that the arrival of news in non-trading periods causes overnight returns, that news sentiment is Granger caused by negative semi-volatility and that news sentiment is more sensitive to negative than to positive jumps. In addition to that we find strong evidence that news sentiment severely Granger causes price jumps and conclude that market participants trade futures as some function of aggregated news. We augment volatility models with news sentiment measures and conduct an out-of-sample volatility forecasting study. The first class of models is the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity models the second class is the high-frequency-based volatility models of Shephard and Shephard [J. Appl.

Design/methodology/approach – The authors use high-frequency data to investigate volatility changes following the suspension of opening and closing call auctions on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India in 1999. The authors evaluate this issue by considering both modelled and realised volatility. Using a GARCH approach the authors model intra-day volatility for the trading days preceding and succeeding the auction suspension. The authors also scrutinise return distributions to look for volatility changes during different parts of the day. Findings – When interpreted collectively, the empirical results suggest that the auction suspension was followed by reduced volatility particularly in the middle of the trading day and at the closing. Practical implications – Given that auctions are often incorporated in trading systems with the aim of curtailing volatility, the main conclusion, that the auction suspension was followed by lower volatility, has important practical inferences. Auctions cannot be automatically relied on to reduce volatility. The intricacies of the auction protocol and their interaction with ancillary market microstructure features may impact on auction efficacy. Originality/value – The paper adopts a novel approach towards assessing the effectiveness of auctions by considering an unusual occurrence of an auction suspension. The empirical setting enables a clear comparison of the respective regimes since these periods do not materially differ in other subsidiary aspects. This is a noteworthy factor, since the empirical contexts considered in prior studies, often feature several simultaneous changes. © 2015, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Moreover, these IMFs and residue are reconstructed into a high frequency component, a low frequency component and a trend component using hierarchical clustering method.

The risk metrics enable the HF trader to fine tune her strategies by trading off different metrics of inventory risk, which also proxy for capital risk, against expected profits. The dynamics of the midprice of the asset are driven by information flows which are impounded in the midprice by market participants who update their quotes in the limit order book. Furthermore, the midprice also exhibits stochastic jumps as a consequence of the arrival of market orders that have an impact on prices which can give rise to market momentum (expected prices to trend up or down).

The most sensitive frequency region of 35-50 kHz occurs at the quasi-constant-frequency terminal portion of the bat's downsweeping frequency-modulated echolocation pulses. Good sensitivity extending down to 20 kHz includes the frequency range of the first harmonic of communication sounds.

First, we show that, although high frequency trading firms initiate more trades on earnings announcement days than on nonannouncement days, the proportion of volume that these trades account for is either constant or marginally lower. High frequency trading firms initiate trades representing a higher proportion of volume during RTHs than during before market or after-market hours. Second, we provide evidence that trades initiated by non-HFTs generally contribute more to price discovery than trades initiated by HFTs. For before market open earnings announcements, trades initiated by non-HFTs contribute more to price discovery than HFTs, for both NYSE- and NASDAQ-listed stocks. However, we find that trades initiated by HFTs contribute heavily to price discovery for NYSE-listed stocks during the RTHs following an after-hours earnings announcement.

The expansion of online financial news sources, such as Internet news and social media sources, provides instantaneous access to financial news. Commercial agencies have started developing their own filtered financial news feeds, which are used by investors and traders to support their algorithmic trading strategies. In this chapter, we use a high-frequency sentiment series, developed by TRNA, to construct a series of daily sentiment scores for DJIA stock index component companies. A variety of forms of this measure, namely, basic scores, absolute values of the series, squared values of the series, and the first differences of the series, are used to estimate three standard volatility models, namely, GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedastic), EGARCH (Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasctic), and GJR (Glosten, Jagganathan and Rundle (1993)). We use these alternative daily DJIA market sentiment scores to examine the relationship between financial news sentiment scores and the volatility of the DJIA return series. We demonstrate how this calibration of machine-filtered news can improve volatility measures. © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Under such a microstructure, stocks may hit their up-limits and down-limits from time to time. However, the behaviors of price limit hits are not well studied partially due to the fact that main stock markets such as the US markets and most European markets do not set price limits. Here, we perform detailed analyses of the high-frequency data of all A-share common stocks traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange from 2000 to 2011 to investigate the statistical properties of price limit hits and the dynamical evolution of several important financial variables before stock price hits its limits. We compare the properties of up-limit hits and down-limit hits. We also divide the whole period into three bullish periods and three bearish periods to unveil possible differences during bullish and bearish market states. To uncover the impacts of stock capitalization on price limit hits, we partition all stocks into six portfolios according to their capitalizations on different trading days. We find that the price limit trading rule has a cooling-off effect (object to the magnet effect), indicating that the rule takes effect in the Chinese stock markets. We find that price continuation is much more likely to occur than price reversal on the next trading day after a limit-hitting day, especially for down-limit hits, which has potential practical values for market practitioners. © 2015 Wan et al."

As introduced by Lehmann, in an information regime all the information is trade related, arrives via order flow, and the fundamental value that underlines the prices does not change, it is simply translated by the size of the executed market order and the backfilling adjustment. During an information regime the best quotes and the underlying values follow a path defined by the limit order book. This implies that algorithmic trading gains can be strengthened not only by identifying these information regimes but also by forecasting the transition periods between regimes that signal fundamental changes in assets' prices, trading behavior, and optimal trading strategies. Our results show that the discovery and identification of information regimes essentially uncover the mechanism by which latent demands are translated into realized prices and volumes and, from here, that they can be used by professional traders. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In the previous study, we built an artificial market model and investigated for the impact of non-position-based market maker’s spread to the markets’ shares of trading volumes. However it had the serious problem that the non-position-based market maker is too simple to manage its own position properly and so we could not judge weather the result of previous study is correct or not. Thus in this study, we made a position-based market maker and explored the competition, in terms of taking markets’ shares of trading volumes, between two artificial financial markets that have exactly the same specifications except existing a market maker, the non-position-based market maker or the position-based market maker. As a result, we found that the position-based market maker can acquire the share of trading volumes from the competitor even though its spread is bigger than bid-offer-spread of the competitor. Moreover, we revealed that position-based market maker can get a profit even in the situation that its spread or tick sizes of the stock exchanges are small. In addition to that, position-based market maker made a profit in almost all experiments which we conducted in this research by changing its spread and tick sizes of markets. At last, we confirmed that position-based market maker can manage its position properly compared to non-position-based market maker. In conclusion, the position-based market maker can not only supply liquidity to stock exchanges and contribute to acquire the share from the competitor as well as the non-position-based market maker does, but also manage its own position properly and make a profit. © 2015, Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence.

Findings – First, both nature disaster announcement and PSA announcement produce negative effects on stock returns. However, there are some differences in effects between the different types of announcement. Second, it is just within the event day (announcement day if trading day, otherwise the first trading day after announcement) that the volatility of stock price is distinctly increased by the two kinds of announcement. Third, there are some differences in the impacts of nature disaster announcement on firms in different industries. Finally, there are also some differences observed between the impacts of PSA announcement on chemical firms and other firms. Originality/value – It is the first time that using high-frequency data to analyze the intraday impact of nature disaster and PSA announcement on stock short price behavior. The results can help us to understand the role of market microstructure playing in the process of stock price formation, especially the stock price movements before and after disaster and accident announcement and the sensitivity to the announcement.

The fault lines have been present for quite some time; however, it is only now, in the last few years that the ramifications of these displacements have been felt. The traditional approach to investing has gone from a focus on investing – namely examining companies to determine whether they will be a good long-term investment – to examining the markets as a whole. Nowhere is this shift more apparent than in the rise and increasing prevalence of quantitative trading models. As a result, there is now a disconnect between the markets themselves and the companies that are traded on the markets. Oftentimes, what a company does or does not do matters very little to whether that company’s stock should be bought or sold. Instead, whether that company’s stock is a good “buy” amounts more to how that stock is doing and how the market is behaving. This shift has broad implications for retail and institutional investor behavior, regulatory structures and the role of government in oversight and, if unchecked, the global economy at large. The ever-changing advances in computer technology have fostered a new breed of trading that is much more reliant on quantitative mathematics than on corporate analysis.

We analyse a set of effects leading to significant biases in the estimation of the ‘criticality index’ n that quantifies the degree of endogeneity of how much past events trigger future events. We report the following model biases: (i) evidence of strong upward biases on the estimation of n when using power law memory kernels in the presence of outliers, (ii) strong effects on n resulting from the form of the regularization part of the power law kernel, (iii) strong edge effects on the estimated n when using power law kernels and (iv) the need for an exhaustive search of the absolute maximum of the log-likelihood function due to its complicated shape. Moreover, we demonstrate that the calibration of the Hawkes process on mixtures of pure Poisson process with changes of regime leads to completely spurious apparent critical values for the branching ratio ((Formula presented.)), while the true value is actually (Formula presented.). More generally, regime shifts on the parameters of the Hawkes model and/or on the generating process itself are shown to systematically lead to a significant upward bias in the estimation of the branching ratio. We demonstrate the importance of the preparation of the high-frequency financial data, in particular: (a) the impact of overnight trading in the analysis of long-term trends, (b) intraday seasonality and detrending of the data and (c) vulnerability of the analysis to day-to-day non-stationarity and regime shifts. Special care is given to the decrease of quality of the timestamps of tick data due to latency and grouping of messages to packets by the stock exchange. Altogether, our careful exploration of the caveats of the calibration of the Hawkes process stresses the need for considering all the above issues before any conclusion can be sustained. In this respect, because the above effects are plaguing their analyses, the claim by Hardiman et al. [Eur. Phys. J. B – Cond. Matter Comp. Syst., 2013, 86, 442] that financial market has been continuously functioning at or close to criticality ((Formula presented.)) cannot be supported.

To do so, we split the time interval of interest into periods in which a well chosen reference price, typically the midprice, remains constant. Within these periods, we view the limit order book as a Markov queuing system. Indeed, we assume that the intensities of the order flows only depend on the current state of the order book. We establish the limiting behavior of this model and estimate its parameters from market data. Then, to design a relevant model for the whole period of interest, we use a stochastic mechanism that allows to switch from one period of constant reference price to another.

The associated 'technological arms race' has created a new market ecology which has made trading cheaper and faster but more volatile and fragmented. This paper charts the technological roots of this transformation from a conventional measurement of innovation perspective. We do so by employing content analysis techniques and extracting market infrastructure patent counts from the USPTO (United States Patent and Trademark Office) database for the period January 1976 to October 2013. From the resulting time series and a qualitative examination of patents we find that (1) the number of market infrastructure patents has dramatically increased since 1999, as confirmed by an associated structural break; (2) the new market ecology has, in true Schumpeterian style, been associated with a new breed of firms, most notably software firms and historically smaller brokerage firms that have invested heavily in technology internally and through strategic acquisitions; and (3) some incumbent firms have responded aggressively to the new market ecology, most notably the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Goldman Sachs. We conclude that policymakers, regulators and academics wishing to further investigate the technological roots of recent changes in capital should refer to patent data. Our principal contribution is to highlight that Wall Street has been actively patenting market infrastructure innovations in a pattern consistent with claims that an associated 'technological arms race' started in the late 1990s. © 2014 Elsevier Inc."

Design/methodology/approach: This paper applies the bivariate Constant Conditional Correlation (CCC) and Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models using high frequency data. Estimates for the bivariate GARCH models are obtained by maximising the log-likelihood of the probability density function of a conditional Student’s t distribution. Findings: This empirical analysis yields a few interesting results: there is a one-way feedback of volatility transmission from the CSI 300 index futures to spot returns, suggesting index futures market leads the spot market; volatility response to past bad news is asymmetric for both markets; volatility can be intensified by the disequilibrium between spot and futures prices; and trading volume has significant impact on volatility for both markets. These results reveal new evidence on the informational efficiency of the CSI 300 index futures market compared to earlier studies. Originality/value: This paper shows that the CSI 300 index futures market has improved in terms of price discovery one year after its existence compared to its early days. This is an important finding for market participants and regulators. Further, this study considers the volatility response to news, market disequilibrium and trading volume.

The bid-ask spread is important for many reasons. Because spread data are not always available, many methods have been suggested for estimating the spread. Existing papers focus on the performance of the estimators either under ideal conditions or in real data. The gap between ideal conditions and the properties of real data are usually ignored. The consistency of the estimates across various sampling frequencies is also ignored. Design/methodology/approach: The estimators and the possible errors are analysed theoretically. Then we perform simulation experiments, reporting the bias, standard deviation and root mean square estimation error of each estimator. More specifically, we assess the effects of the following factors on the performance of the estimators: the magnitude of the spread relative to returns volatility, randomly varying of spreads, the autocorrelation of mid-price returns and mid-price changes caused by trade directions and feedback trading. Findings: The best estimates come from using the highest frequency of data available. The relative performance of estimators can vary quite markedly with the sampling frequency. In small samples, the standard deviation can be more important to the estimation error than bias; in large samples, the opposite tends to be true. Originality/value: There is a conspicuous lack of simulation evidence on the comparative performance of different estimators of the spread under the less than ideal conditions that are typical of real-world data. This paper aims to fill this gap. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Then, a more general formulation of the above scaling properties allows to extend the model to the afternoon trading session. We finally outline an application in which conditioned forecasting is used to implement a trend-following trading strategy capable of exploiting linear correlations present in the S&P data-set and absent in the model. Trading signals are model based and not derived from chartist criteria. In-sample and out-of-sample tests indicate that the model-based trading strategy performs better than a benchmark one established on an asymmetric GARCH process, and show the existence of small arbitrage opportunities. We remark that in the absence of linear correlations the trading profit would vanish and discuss why the trading strategy is potentially interesting to hedge volatility risk for S&P index-based products. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis."

The high-frequency trader chooses to post either market orders or limit orders, which are represented, respectively, by impulse controls and regular controls. We discuss the consequences of the two main features of this microstructure: first, the limit orders are only partially executed, and therefore she has no control on the executed quantity. Second, the high-frequency trader faces the overtrading risk, which is the risk of large variations in her inventory. The consequences of this risk are investigated in the context of optimal liquidation. The optimal trading problem is studied by stochastic control and dynamic programming methods, and we provide the associated numerical resolution procedure and prove its convergence. We propose dimension reduction techniques in several cases of practical interest. We also detail a high-frequency trading strategy in the case where a (predictive) directional information on the price is available.

Our estimation procedure is based only on a preestimation of the Fourier coefficients of the volatility process. This approach constitutes a novelty in comparison with the nonparametric leverage estimators proposed in the literature, generally based on a preestimation of spot volatility, and it can be directly applied to estimate the leverage effect in the case of irregular trading observations and in the presence of microstructure noise contaminations, that is, in a high-frequency framework. The finite sample performances of the Fourier estimator of the leverage are tested in numerical simulations and in an empirical application to S&P 500 index futures. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We analyze a structural model of optimal order placement that captures trade-off between the costs and benefits of order display. For a benchmark model of pure liquidity competition, we give a closed-form solution for optimal display sizes. We show that competition in liquidity supply incentivizes the use of hidden orders to prevent losses due to over-bidding. Thus, because aggressive liquidity competition is more prevalent in liquid stocks, our model predicts that the proportion of hidden liquidity is higher in liquid markets.

The author reviews various institutional and operational approaches enabling investors to deal with such asymmetry. These include: fi nancial intermediaries, information agencies and advanced information technology, market portfolio and asset pricing modeling, algorithmic fi nancial strategies and high-frequency trading, option strategies as well as personalized portfolio selection based on perspective assumptions theory. All of them could help investors to minimize the risks. However, none of them could serve as a comprehensive solution. Moreover, in practice they produce additional risks and confl icts of interest. The most known example is principal-agent problem. Under these circumstances one of the key investor's goal is to increase his own ability to deal with informational asymmetry and market uncertainty. That is, investor wants to acquire a greater sense for choosing proactive risk management strategy and for not be fooled by randomness. Author believes that cause-effect relation drives most of all market events. How to deal with uncertainty and informational asymmetry while assuming that investor's ability to collect and process all existed information is limited? It would be worth for any investor (or, broadly speaking, for any kind of economic actors) to focus their attention to the most meaningful informational signals or events which differ markedly from others. It is also suggested that such events may cause further meaningful effects. To defi ne such informational signals author refers to well known ""butterfl y effect. Similarly to the meteorological exponentially developing processes, in economic and social sphere we may fi nd Exponentially Scalable Events, or ESE.

In this chapter, I review some of the more common criticisms in light of the extant empirical evidence. These criticisms are mostly found to be lacking in substance. On the whole, HFT has improved market quality by reducing bid/ask spreads, enhancing immediacy, improving price discovery, and making markets more resilient to unexpected shocks. Despite this, a relatively small suite of pathological behaviors merit attention, such as front running, spoofing, quote stuffing and smoking. Addressing these behaviors, however, must recognize that all possible market and regulatory structures have both costs and benefits. The job of the regulator, in essence, is to choose which warts to live with, in order to achieve a satisfactory trade-off of these pluses and minuses. © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

This model performs gradient descent in a constrained functional space by directly minimizing loss functions customized with different trading performance measurements. To demonstrate its practical applications, a simple trading system was designed with trading signals constructed from pdGBM predictions and fixed holding period in each trade. We tested this trading system on the high-frequency data of SPDR S&P 500 index ETF (SPY). In the out-of-sample period, it generated an average of 0.045% return per trade and an annualized Sharpe ratio close to 20 after transaction costs. Various empirical results also showed the model robustness to different parameters. These superior performances confirm the predictability of short-horizon price movements in the US equity market. We also compared the performance of this trading system with similar trading systems based on other predictive models like the gradient boosting model with L2 loss function and the penalized linear model. Results showed that pdGBM substantially outperformed all other models by higher returns in each month of the testing period.

Median-joining network analysis of D-loop sequences from these individuals and others characterized in previous studies allowed us to determine that Ugandan pigs cluster with populations from the West (Europe/North Africa), Far East and India. In addition, partial sequencing of the Y-chromosome UTY locus in 18 Ugandan domestic pigs revealed the segregation of a single HY1 lineage that has a cosmopolitan distribution. A Western and Far Eastern ancestry for East African pigs had been already reported, but this is the first study demonstrating an additional contribution from the Indian porcine gene pool. This result is consistent with the high frequency of zebuine alleles in cattle from East Africa. The geographic coordinates of East Africa, at the crossroads of many trading routes that, through the ages, linked Europe, Africa and Asia, might explain the rich and complex genetic heritage of livestock native to this area. © 2015 Stichting International Foundation for Animal Genetics."

Based on China stock market which is dominated by individual investors, this study focus on whether traders of block trading, which are usually institutional investors, are “information trader.” Design/methodology/approach – Based on the high frequency data, the paper constructs two measures of information asymmetry, intraday measure and inter-day measure. Then the paper constructs a multiple regression model and examine how block trading and information asymmetry contribute to the firm-specific information measured by the stock return synchronicity. Findings – The results show that: on the one hand, block trading transmits more firm-specific information, and can reduce the synchronicity; on the other hand, when the degree of information asymmetry is higher, block trading contains more firm-specific information and has a stronger effect on synchronicity. The effect of information asymmetry specifically displays as: block trading during the first half-hour of the trading day has a stronger effect on synchronicity; and block trading occurred in the days with publicly announced trading information has greater impact on synchronicity. Practical implications – The conclusions have important practical implications: for market regulators, monitoring for block trading can improve the recognition and prevention of insider trading; for individual investors, especially the risk aversion investors, recognition of intraday and inter-day information asymmetry is beneficial for them to avoid the risk of asymmetric information. Originality/value – First, the domestic and foreign research mostly concentrated impact of block trading on stock prices. However, reasons of stock price changes include the information effect and non-information effect, this paper selects stock return synchronicity as firm-specific information measure, and mainly focus on the information effect of block trading. Second, based on the high frequency data, the paper constructs two measures of information asymmetry, intraday measure and inter-day measure. Compared with general measure of information asymmetry, such as firm size, earnings quality, the two measures based on high frequency data are more precisely. © 2015, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

They are under pressure from three sets of actors-their customers (firms that trade on their exchanges), their regulator, and government-political officials-in an operating environment transformed by technology firms providing new capabilities for exchanges and their counterparties. This chapter compares and contrasts major global exchanges in terms of how these actors pressure them with respect to the trade-off between commercial viability and fairness and how the exchanges have responded to these challenges. Because the various actors have different agendas, exchanges face a dilemma. Efforts to accommodate one set of actors may generate opposition from another set. Competition among global exchanges for business encourages them to mobilize regulators and government-political officials to support their efforts to deal with HFT, but many exchanges face regulators who are attempting to control HFT. These relations define the nexus within which global exchanges must operate. © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

As an unintended consequence, market orders that were intended to be executed instantly with the best existing quotes in the market have experienced an increased likelihood of not being executed. Across various currency pairs in 2010, the failure rate of market orders was approximately 60%. This high rate of market-order execution failures cannot be observed in 2003-2004. By fully examining the EBS order-by-order database, we provide vivid illustrations of behaviors observed in limit orders and market orders at high frequency. We find evidence that market orders in the EBS FX markets fail to be executed because (1) turnover of orders is too fast for a market order to hit a moving target and (2) market orders are not only being used in the traditional sense in which a trader is promised an immediate transaction but also being used for strategic trading. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Understanding technological innovations in financial information systems (IS) and technologies has been challenging for technology consultants and financial industry practitioners due to the underlying complexities though. In this article, we propose an ecosystem analysis approach by extending the technology ecosystem paths of influence model (Adomavicius et al., 2008a) to incorporate stakeholder actions, considering both supply-side and demand-side forces for technological change. Our ecosystem model brings together three original core elements: technology components, technology-based services, and technology-supported business infrastructures. We also contribute a fourth new element to this approach involving stakeholder analysis. We investigate innovations in the area of high-frequency trading (HFT) technologies as a basis for empirically validating the existence of several different patterns in the historical path of technology evolution. Our analysis results suggest that supply-side and demand-side forces influenced HFT technology innovations and contributed to changes in the financial markets. This research represents some of the first work that investigates financial market technology innovations at the technology and stakeholder levels.

The two series are respectively related to the instantaneous volatility and the market liquidity; hence, they are particularly suited to test microstructure hypotheses. Design/methodology/approach: ALog-autoregressive conditional duration model was adopted to include the information on the traders’ identity at the transaction level. High-frequency data were used and how the informed traders and the liquidity provider affect the arrival of market events was studied. The robustness of our results was also checked by testing different distributions and controlling for microstructure effects. Findings: It was found that informed traders and the liquidity provider exert a dominant role in accelerating the market activity. This result depends on the state of the market, i.e. it is effective only during periods of high frequency of transactions. The estimates for price durations show that a high instantaneous volatility can be mainly ascribed to a great concentration of informed traders. Informed traders are also found to shorten volume durations by clustering small-size orders to disguise their private signal. For both durations, the liquidity provider is also found to foster the market activity, likely because of his contractual duties. Originality/value: The article is of interest for researchers in the field of market microstructure, as well as for specialists in the high-frequency trading. Results provide an empirical confirmation of information models which theorize an accelerating effect for informed trading. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first contribution to study the impact of traders’categories at the transaction level and with different definitions of durations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Suppose trader B trades less than trader A. Other things equal, trader B is more efficient than trader A because trader B attains the same SR as trader A with less trading time. Trader B's efficiency is not apparent when annualized SR (ASR) formulas are extended to high-frequency trading (HFT). In this chapter, we show how the pantheon of modified SRs in the literature could be adjusted by a single factor, which identifies trader efficiency via adaptive HFT stock price dynamics and cycle lengths for maximal alpha. Specifically, we derive a directing process for HFT trade strategy, which jumps positively only when the trader executes a successful trade or stays flat otherwise. We identify a simple intuitively appealing summary statistic, which can be extrapolated from publicly available data, and which serves as the single factor for modifying ASR to get an efficient Sharpe ratio (ESR). Application to risk and return data for HFT in Baron et al. (2014) finds that the ESR for aggressive HFT is 1.15, medium HFT is 2.88, and passive HFT is 1.43. Those ESRs for HFT numbers are equivalent to reported SR estimates for hedge funds multistrategy, convertible option arbitrage, and fund of fund strategies. © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

This feature set is called the the signature representation of a stream. It has its origin in pure mathematics and relies on a relationship between non-commutative polynomials and paths. This representation had already significant impact on algebraic topology, control theory, numerics for PDEs, stochastic analysis and the theory of rough paths; more recently first steps have been taken to apply such methods to the study of big data streams. We show that the signature representation can provide an efficient summary of a stream and its effects. We then show that it can be combined with standard tools from machine learning. After introducing the signature for streams and some theoretical background, we apply this approach to a challenging real-world example: high-frequency financial data streams. In this context, the streams are tickby-tick market data of a stock traded at the New York stock exchange NYSE and the effect of the stream is the profit and loss of complex investment strategies (i.e. a nonlinear functional of the stream). Our numerical results (applied to Thomson-Reuters tick data of several full trading days for IBM stocks) show that the signature of the price stream efficiently captures the necessary information to learn the return of an investment strategy. However, we emphasize that the underlying ideas are not limited to financial data streams and have the potential to be applied to many other areas in data mining where the non-commutative nature of streams is of importance, like text mining, bioinformatics or click history. © Copyright 2014 ACM."

The stock price is driven by a Markov renewal process (MRP), as described in [P. Fodra and H. Pham, Appl. Math. Finance, to appear], while market orders arrive in the limit order book via a point process correlated with the stock price itself. In this framework, we can reproduce the adverse selection risk, appearing in two different forms: the usual form due to big market orders impacting the stock price and penalizing the agent, and the weak form due to small market orders and reducing the probability of a profitable execution. We solve the market making problem by stochastic control techniques in this semi-Markov model. In the no risk-aversion case, we provide an explicit formula for the optimal controls and characterize the value function as a simple linear PDE. In the general case, we derive the optimal controls and the value function in terms of the previous result and illustrate how the risk aversion influences the trader strategy and her expected gain. Finally, by using a perturbation method, approximate optimal controls for small risk aversions are explicitly computed in terms of two simple PDEs, drastically reducing the computational cost and enlightening the financial interpretation of the results. © 2015 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics."

In contrast to the widely accepted theory of volatility asymmetry (i.e. negative returns induce higher price volatilities than positive ones), we show that the price volatilities in Chinese market react more intensively to positive returns than their reaction to negative returns. This reverse volatility asymmetry is mainly due to the higher trading volume associated with positive returns, that is, in Chinese market the investors’ rushing for a price rising stock makes the positive returns arouse higher volatility than their negative counterparts. So in an average sense, a positive return–volatility correlation is observed for most of the individual stocks in our sample. Besides, price jumps play an important role in the significance of this positive correlation. For most of the individual stocks in our sample, the positive correlation is insignificant until jumps are totally eliminated in both return and volatility. For multiple stocks analysed together, the jumps of individual stocks are mostly diversified, and therefore a significant positive return–volatility correlation shows up irrespective of the existence of jumps. Moreover, our results are robust in different market conditions, no matter in depression or flourish. © 2014 Taylor & Francis."

Design/methodology/approach-The authors test for lead-lag effects between the Indian Nifty and Nifty Junior indices using Pesaran-Timmermann tests and Granger-Causality. Then, a simple test on overnight returns is proposed to infer whether the observed predictability is mainly attributable to non-synchronous trading or some form of inefficiency. Findings-The evidence suggests that non-synchronous trading is a better explanation for the observed predictability in the Indian Stock Market. Research limitations/implications-The indication that non-synchronous trading effects become more pronounced in high-frequency data suggests that prior studies using daily data may underestimate the impacts of non-synchronicity. Originality/value-The originality of the paper rests on various important contributions: overnight returns is looked at to infer whether predictability is more attributable to non-synchronous trading or to some form of inefficiency; the impacts of non-synchronicity are investigated in terms of lead-lag effects rather than serial correlation; and high-frequency data is used which gauges the impacts of non-synchronicity during less active parts of the trading day. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

FPGA cards are widely used to reduce latency and accelerate market data processing. To create a low latency trading system, it is crucial to effectively build a representation of the market state (book) in hardware. Thus, we have designed a new hardware architecture, which updates the book with the best bid/offer prices based on the incoming messages from the exchange. For each message a corresponding financial instrument needs to be looked up and its record needs to be updated. Proposed architecture is utilizing cuckoo hashing for the book handling, which enables low latency symbol lookup and high memory utilization. In this paper we discuss a trade-off between lookup latency and memory utilization. With average latency of 253 ns the proposed architecture is able to handle 119 275 instruments while using only 144 Mbit QDR SRAM. © 2014 IEEE."

After proposing a model representing HFTs’ activities in financial market when they act as market makers, we carry out simulations to explore how order price and order quantity affect HFTs’ profits and risks. As the result, we find that offering prices around last trading price, as well as taking advantage of order imbalance, increases HFTs’ returns. On the other hand, our results show utilizing adaptive order size based on previous order execution rate and setting a net threshold based on average trading volume helps to control the risks of end-of-day inventory.

The Flash Crash of May 6, 2010 is taken as evidence of the potential harmful effects of high frequency trading. On the other hand, some view high frequency trading as a manifestation of technological advances that have reduced the optimal trade size and improved order routing. From that perspective, high speed trading is a continuation of a long-standing trend to more rapid and more efficient trading. This study shows that the speed of trading has changed dramatically. The average number of trades per day for large cap New York Stock Exchange stocks has risen from about 500 to more than 40 000 in the period 1993-2011. At the same time, the average trade size has fallen from 1600 shares to 200 shares. The ultimate sources of these changes are the technology that has automated almost all aspects of trading and the regulatory developments that have helped reduce bid-ask spreads and made markets more accessible. The result of these developments is that markets are considerably more liquid and less costly. High frequency traders draw on this liquidity and also contribute to it. © 2015 Korean Securities Association."

We use a modified version of the multifractal model of asset returns (MMAR) where trading time is represented by the series of volume ticks. Our dataset consists of 138,418 5-min round-the-clock observations of EUR/USD spot quotes and trading ticks during the period January 5, 2006 to December 31, 2007. Considering fat-tails, long-range dependence as well as scale inconsistency with the MMAR, we derive out-of-sample value-at-risk (VaR) forecasts and compare our approach to historical simulation as well as a benchmark GARCH(1,1) location-scale VaR model. Our findings underline that the multifractal properties in EUR/USD returns in fact have notable risk management implications. The MMAR approach is a parsimonious model which produces admissible VaR forecasts at the 12-h forecast horizon. For the daily horizon, the MMAR outperforms both alternatives based on conditional as well as unconditional coverage statistics. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The text proposes a framework according to which finance can best be understood as a complex technical system tightly coupled to other social, economic systems. To be more precise, the paper attempts to show how finance is not just any complex system but it can be understood as an ecology of evolving socio-technical systems, sub-systems such as investment banks, hedge funds, high-frequency trading traders, retail investors, pensions funds, etc. All of these are the technical building blocks of our financial markets. Moreover, we attempt to show how concepts from other disciplines, such as entropy, information and noise, can be useful in opening up the world of finance from its traditional economic milieu. Although the following text is confined to the discursive realm of humanities/social sciences, it echoes the analytical approaches of econophysics and experimental economics and particularly the ongoing research around ‘computational evolutionary economics’ [Mirowski, P. 2007. “Markets Come to Bits: Evolution, Computation and Markomata in Economic Science.” Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization 63: 209–242; Mirowski, P. 2010. “Inherent Vice: Minsky, Markomata, and the Tendency of Markets to Undermine Themselves.” Journal of Institutional Economics 6: 415–443]. This becomes particularly relevant in the context of the so-called robot phase transition from human-dominated trading to the more automatic electronic trading. The current microstructure of automatic market-making can be understood as an ‘ecological niche’ developed by ultra-fast trading algorithms which ‘feed’ on the asymmetries and disparities of the wider ‘financial ecology’. They do this by dissipating noise and adding to the complexity of market microstructure a behaviour that can push the whole ecology to critical thresholds, sometimes referred to as flash crashes. This whole process can ultimately be described by Philip Mirowski's notion of ‘inherent vice’, as well as by Sir Robert May's concept of instability ‘which develops in ecosystems upon increasing bio-diversity’ [Caccioli, F., M. Marsili, and P. Vivo. 2007. “Eroding Market Stability by Proliferation of Financial Instruments.” The European Physical Journal B–Condensed Matter and Complex Systems 71: 467–479; Haldane, A., and R.

When an analysis of RRL trading performance is conducted using low frequency financial data (e.g. daily data), the weakening autocorrelation in price changes may lead to a decrease in trading profits as compared to its applications in high frequency trading. There therefore is a need to improve RRL for the purposes of daily equity trading. This paper presents two parameter update schemes (the 'average elitist' and the 'multiple elitist') for RRL. The purpose of the first scheme is to improve out-of-sample performance of RRL-type trading systems. The second scheme aims to exploit serial dependence in stock returns to improve trading performance, when traders deal with highly correlated stocks. Profitability and stability of the trading system are examined by using four groups of S&P stocks for the period January 2009 to December 2012. It is found that the Sharpe ratios of the stocks increase after we use the two parameter update schemes in the RRL trading system. © 2014 IEEE."

Results indicate that the long memory property remains quite stable across different time scales for both unconditional and conditional volatility measures. Results from the non-overlapping moving window approach indicate that the extreme events (such as the subprime crisis and the European debt crisis) resulted in highly persistent behavior of the USD/INR exchange rate and thus lead to market inefficiency. This paper also examines the long memory property in the realized volatility based on different time scale data. Results indicate that the realized volatility measures based on different scales of the high frequency data exhibit a consistent and stable long memory property.

One of the reasons for such popularity is that the result of this type of operation depends solely on the relationship between the price of two assets, and not on the overall market condition. The possibility of spotting inefficiencies in assets pricing is what allows the investor to make consistent profits using a systematic method for trading financial contracts. Based on the opening of a long and short position, this statistical arbitrage strategy seeks to profit when the prices of both assets converge to their historical behavior. The objective of this paper is to analyze the performance of the pairs trading strategy for different frequencies of data in the Brazilian Stock Market. The study was based on Perlin (2009), which shows that market inefficiencies are higher for stock data sampled in higher frequency, in this case daily, weekly and monthly. The present research extends the range of frequencies to the intraday universe with stock prices sampled at 1, 5, 15, 30 and 60 minutes and daily. The period of the database starts from 1st January 2008 until 31st December 2011. The selection of stocks comprises the twenty assets with the highest number of contracts negotiated in the period. The methodology employed in this research uses training periods and periods of technical negotiations. In the training period, the selection of pairs for each stock is based on the lowest quadratic variation of their normalized prices. In the trading period, the strategy checks the performance of the previously defined trades. The results of the study, which compared the Sharpe ratios of the pairs trading strategy for the different frequency of the data, confirm the primary hypothesis that the higher sampling frequency, the higher evidence of market inefficiency.

We build on David Harvey’s theory of the spatial fix to describe three digital spatial fixes, fixed capital projects that use the specific properties of digital spaces to increase the rate of profit, before themselves becoming obstacles to the addictive cycle of accumulation: the primitive accumulation of time in the social Web, the annihilation of time by space in high-frequency trading, and affect rent in virtual worlds.

Our algorithm automatically extracts fuzzy rules from past trades by taking into account the predicted return size and intraday time varying realized volatility, the latter used as a proxy for uncertainty. The model identifies unique intraday scenarios and subsequently creates a dynamic and visually apprehensible risk-return search space to control algorithmic trading decisions.

We deal with all three types of trading halts, namely intraday halts, one-day halts and inter-day halts, of 203 stocks in Shanghai Stock Exchange from August 2009 to 2011. We find that absolute return, trading volume, and in case of bid-ask spread around intraday halts share the same pattern with a sharp peak and a power law relaxation after that. While for different types of trading halts, the peaks' height and the relaxation exponents are different. From the perspective of halt reasons or halt durations, the relaxation exponents of absolute return after inter-day halts are larger than those after intraday halts and one-day halts, which implies that inter-day halts are most effective. From the perspective of price trends, the relaxation exponents of excess absolute return and excess volume for positive events are larger than those for negative events in case of intraday halts and one-day halts, implying that positive events are more effective than negative events for intraday halts and one-day halts.

A notable limiting feature of PIN is that one must aggregate very fine intraday data over very long macro horizons in order to estimate it. In this paper, our aim is to develop and implement a dynamic intraday measure of the probability of informed trading that circumvents this aggregation issue and allows for the measurement of information based trading activity at much higher frequencies.

I examine two overlapping types of algorithmic traders: high-frequency traders, who exploit speed advantages for profit, and market makers, who facilitate trade and supply liquidity by simultaneously maintaining offers to buy and sell. I employ simulation and empirical game-theoretic analysis to study trader behavior in equilibrium, that is, when all traders best- respond to their environment and other agents' strategies. I focus on the impact of algorithmic trading on allocative efficiency, or overall gains from trade, and the potential for a call market, in which orders are matched to trade at periodic intervals, to mitigate the latency advantages of high- frequency traders.

The base-8 digital coding sequence, which is capable of revealing contrasting aggregation against sparsity of extreme events, is further compressed into a shortened sequence of state transitions. This compressed digital code sequence vividly demonstrates that the aggregation of large absolute returns is the primary driving force for stimulating both the aggregations of large trading volumes and transaction numbers. The state of system-wise synchrony is manifested with very frequent recurrence in the stock dynamics. And this data-driven dynamic mechanism is seen to correspondingly vary as the global market transiting in and out of contraction-expansion cycles. These results not only elaborate the stock dynamics of interest to a fuller extent, but also contradict some classical theories in finance. Overall this version of stock dynamics is potentially more coherent and realistic, especially when the current financial market is increasingly powered by high-frequency trading via computer algorithms, rather than by individual investors. © 2014 Fushing et al."

Our market environment is populated by fast and slow traders, who reenter to trade at different rates. We employ empirical game-theoretic methods to determine the market types and trading strategies selected in equilibrium. We also analyze best-response patterns to characterize the frequent call market's basin of attraction.

Advanced data feed and audit trail information from market operators now make the full observation of market participants' actions possible. A key question is the extent to which it is possible to understand and characterize the behavior of individual participants from observations of trading actions. In this paper, we consider the basic problems of categorizing and recognizing traders (or, equivalently, trading algorithms) on the basis observed limit orders. Our approach, which is based on inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), is to model trading decisions as a Markov decision process and then use observations of an optimal decision policy to find the reward function. The approach strikes a balance between two desirable features in that it captures key empirical properties of order book dynamics and yet remains computationally tractable.

Investigations into what was dubbed “the Flash Crash” centered primarily on the extensive use of computer algorithms automated for “high frequency trading” (HFT).

We analyze the efficiency of the resulting market and the way the surplus from trading is apportioned among agents as a function of the number and type of high frequency traders.

Together with high-frequency trading comes the need for fast simulations of full synthetic markets for several purposes including scenario analyses for risk evaluation. These simulations are very suitable to be run on massively parallel architectures. Aside more traditional large-scale parallel computers, high-end personal computers equipped with several multi-core CPUs and general-purpose GPU programming are gaining im- portance as cheap and easily available alternatives.

We show that market makers employ ""cluster undercutting"" practices in the upstairs market, which are based on a notional minimum price increment and resemble an anchoring-and-adjustment effect. In particular, we report that liquidity providers consistently buy just below the implicit minimum price increment and consistently sell just above it. This finding is strongly related to stock-price momentum and periods of increased trade intensity. Overall, this effect has only a weak connection to differences in informed trading and is mostly related to the notional price barriers and resistance levels introduced by the minimum tick size of the order book. © 2013 Elsevier Inc."

Gone are the dealers on NASDAQ and the specialists at the NYSE. Instead, a company's stock can now be traded on up to sixty competing venues where a computer matches incoming orders. High-frequency traders (HFTs) post the majority of quotes and are the preponderant source of liquidity in the new market. Many practices associated with the new stock market are highly controversial, as illustrated by the public furor following the publication of Michael Lewis's book Flash Boys. Critics say that HFTs use their speed in discovering changes in the market and in altering their orders to take advantage of other traders. Dark pools- off-exchange trading venues that promise to keep the orders sent to them secret and to restrict the parties allowed to trade-are accused of operating in ways that injure many traders. Brokers are said to mishandle customer orders in an effort to maximize the payments they receive for sending trading venues their customers' orders, rather than delivering best execution. In this Article, we set out a simple, but powerful, conceptual framework for analyzing the new stock market. The framework is built upon three basic concepts: adverse selection, the principal-agent problem, and a multivenue trading system. We illustrate the utility of this framework by analyzing the new market's eight most controversial practices. The effects of each practice are evaluated in terms of the multiple social goals served by equity-trading markets. We ultimately conclude that there is no emergency requiring immediate, poorly considered action. Some reforms proposed by critics, however, are clearly desirable. Other proposed reforms involve a trade-off between two or more valuable social goals. In these cases, whether a reform is desirable may be unclear, but a better understanding of the trade-off involved enables a more informed choice and suggests areas in which further empirical research would be useful. Finally, still other proposed reforms are based on misunderstandings of the market or of the social impacts of a practice and should be avoided. © 2015 Merritt B. Fox, Lawrence R.

Little academic research has been invested in actually trying to build successful real-time trading models for the high-frequency foreign exchange market, which is characterized by inherent complexity and heterogeneity. The present work opens new directions for inference on market efficiency in an attempt to account for the use of technical analysis by practitioners over many years now. This paper presents a heuristic model that efficiently emulates the dynamic learning of intraday traders. The proposed setup incorporates agent beliefs, preferences and expectations while it integrates the calibration of technical rules by means of adaptive training. The study focuses on EUR/USD which is the most liquid and widely traded currency pair. The data consist of a very large tick-by-tick sample of bid and ask prices covering many trading periods to enhance robustness in the results. The efficiency of a technical trading strategy based on the proposed model is investigated in terms of directional predictability. The heuristic learning system is compared against many non-linear models, a random walk and a buy & hold strategy. Based on statistical testing it is shown that, with the inclusion of transaction costs, the profitability of the new model is consistently superior. These findings provide evidence of technical predictability under incomplete information and can be justified by invoking the existence of heterogeneity caused by many factors affecting market microstructure. Overall, the results suggest that the proposed model can be used to improve upon traditional technical analysis approaches. © 2014 Elsevier B.V."

We accelerate it by FPGA NIC with C-based and SQL-based HLS, and show the necessity of high level language customizable reconfigurable chip. Then, we illustrate the difference of FPGA and processor (CPU, GPGPU) with the 'FSM+Datapath' model and examine how the architecture difference affects delay and parallelism of operations. Next, we discuss parallelization of operations, threads with High Level Synthesis for FPGA and software compiler for processors. The main advantage of the former method is it is able to parallelize operations beyond control dependencies while the latter method has to obey control dependencies. Finally, some experimental results prove that 'FPGA and HLS' generate better performance than a processor for control intensive algorithm. © 2014 IEEE."

Specifically it is argued that HFT did not cause or exacerbate the flash crash, that it is not as profitable as it is typically portrayed to be, and that it is confused with other operations. Counterarguments are presented against the arguments put forward by the opponents of HFT. Although the case for a special regulation of HFT is weak, abusive practices such as 'front running' should be banned, whether they are associated with high-frequency or low-frequency traders.

While attaining circuit performance is critical for the future commercialization of these mm-wave technologies, process sensitivity and die yielding are equally critical for delivering a robust commercial product. This chapter discusses the unique effects of process variation at high mm-wave frequencies and several new calibration schemes to optimize their performance. While conventional microwave RFIC design is typically accomplished by de-sensitizing a circuit design to process parameters at the expense of peak performance, the design margins remain much lower at mm-wave.

It is especially important to see how these features evolve over time after the market is created and gradually develops. The recent advent of the digital currency, Bitcoin, and its growing popularity as an asset traded between agents over the last few years, provides us with an invaluable dataset for such a study. Similar to many financial markets, Bitcoin is de-centralized and its value is not controlled by a single institution, (e.g., a central bank). Here we have analyzed high-frequency Bitcoin trading data (with a resolution of one tick, i.e., a single trading event). We show that the distribution of price fluctuation (measured in terms of logarithmic return) has a heavy tail. The exponent of the tail implies that Bitcoin fluctuations follow an inverse square law, in contrast to the inverse cubic law exhibited by most financial and commodities markets. The distribution of transaction sizes and trading volume are seen to have Levy-stable distribution.

This paper provides new insights into improving the time-varying risk-adjusted performance of trading systems controlled by Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Systems (ANFIS) or Dynamic Evolving Neuro Fuzzy Systems (DENFIS). Contrary to most former studies which focus on daily predictions, we compare these models in an intraday stock trading scenario using high-frequency data. Firstly, we propose a dynamic extension of the popular moving average rule and enhance it with a model validation methodology using heat maps to analyse favourable profitability in specific holding time and signal regions. Secondly, we study the effect of realistic constraints such as transaction costs and intraday trading hours, which many existing approaches in the literature ignore. Thirdly, unlike most former studies that only aim to minimise statistical error measures, we compare this approach with financially more relevant risk-adjusted objective functions. To this end, we also consider an innovative ANFIS ensemble architecture which on an intraday level dynamically selects between different risk-adjusted models. Our study shows that accounting for transaction costs and the use of risk-return objective functions provide better results in out-of-sample tests. Overall, the ANN model is identified as a viable model, however ANFIS shows more stable time-varying performance across multiple market regimes. Moreover, we find that combining multiple risk-adjusted objective functions using an ANFIS ensemble yields promising results. © 2014 Elsevier B.V."

As such, liquidity is a multidimensional concept. In this chapter, I review several widely used econometrics or statistics–based measures that researchers have developed to capture one or more dimensions of a security′s liquidity (i.e., limited dependent variable model (Lesmond, D. A. et al. Review of Financial Studies, 12(5), 1113–1141, 1999) and autocovariance of price changes (Roll, R., Journal of Finance, 39, 1127–1139, 1984). These alternative proxies have been designed to be estimated using either low–frequency or high–frequency data, so I discuss four liquidity proxies that are estimated using low–frequency data and two proxies that require high–frequency data. Low–frequency measures permit the study of liquidity over relatively long time horizons; however, they do not reflect actual trading processes. To overcome this limitation, high–frequency liquidity proxies are often used as benchmarks to determine the best low–frequency proxy. In this chapter, I find that estimates from the effective tick measure perform best among the four low–frequency measures tested. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015."

Using the uncertainty framework, the paper develops an uncertain fuzzy credibility regression model in the form of a linear and quadratic CAPM in order to estimate these performance skills. Using the probability framework the paper implements frequentist and Bayesian CAPMs (linear and quadratic) to estimate the same performance skills. We consider a data set of monthly investment style indices published by Hedge Fund Research group. The data set extends from January 1995 to June 2010. We divide this sample period into four overlapping sub-sample periods that contain different market trends. Using the probability framework, our results show that bounded rationality triggers inefficiencies in the market that fund managers can utilise to outperform the market. This market outperformance is due to selectivity and market timing skill during periods of economic recovery only. We admit that these results contradict the rational expectations model. However, with the uncertainty framework this effect disappears on behalf of the rational expectations model and the efficient market hypothesis. This disappearance may be a result of the increased amount of high frequency trading witnessed recently that has made market inefficiencies, which are the main source of hedge fund performance, rarer."

Sell trades tend to demand higher liquidity than buys, while extreme trading conditions demand more liquidity than non-extreme ones. In extreme sells, liquidity demand surpasses supply.

As a result, there is a demand for comprehensive model exploration and validation in high level statistical programming environments such as R. Many financial applications require on-demand processing, which in turn requires fast modeling and calibration computations. In this paper we describe our work on speeding up the calibration of a Heston stochastic volatility model, a financial application, on GPUs. The Heston volatility model is used extensively across the capital markets to price and measure the market risk of exchange traded financial options. However, a typical R based implementation of the Heston model calibration on a CPU does not meet the performance requirements for sub-minute level trading, i.e. mid to high frequency trading. The calibration of a Heston model is performed over M option data points which remains fixed during the calibration computation. The most computation intensive part of this computation is the ErrorFunction() which estimates the error between market observed and model option prices. We have implemented the ErrorFunction() using a Map-Reduce design pattern leading to efficient implementation on various architectures including GPUs. In this paper, we describe the implementation of a GPU optimized kernel for this computation that can be called by the R script performing the calibration process. For M = 1024 we demonstrate a factor of 760x improvement in the overall calibration time over the R sequential implementation by off-loading ErrorFunction() on a system with an Intel Core i5 processor and NVIDIA Tesla K20c (Kepler architecture) consisting of 2496 cores. Note that not all the performance gain is due to the GPU- partly it is due to the reduction in the overhead of R for the Heston model calculation. For comparison we also implemented the calibration code using C/C + +. We observed a speed up of 230x for the GPU based implementation over the C/C + + indicating that a factor of 3.4x improvement is due to avoiding the R overhead for the Heston model calculation. However, the overall calibration time using R based optimization routines combined with the GPU off-loaded ErrorFunction() is comparable to a C/C + + GPU based calibration code."

A Lorentzian approximation to R-matrix theory is used to analyze the complex structures observed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on a typical trading day. Resonant structures in excited nuclei are characterized by the values of their fundamental strength function, (average total width of the states)/(average spacing between adjacent states). Here, values of the ratios (average lifetime of individual states of a given component of the daily Dow Jones Industrial Average)/(average interval between the adjacent states) are determined. The ratios for the observed fine and intermediate structure of the index are found to be essentially constant throughout the trading day. These quantitative findings are characteristic of the highly statistical nature of many-body, strongly interacting systems, typified by daily trading. It is therefore proposed that the values of these ratios, determined in the first hour-or-so of trading, be used to provide valuable information concerning the likely performance of the fine and intermediate components of the index for the remainder of the trading day. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."

We investigate the effect of option markets, especially that of dynamic hedging, on their underlying markets by using an artificial market. We propose a two-market model in which an option market and its underlying market interact. In our model, there are three types of agents, underlying local agents trading only on the underlying market, option local agents who trade only on the option market, and global agents who trade both on the underlying and the option market. In this simulation, we investigate the effect of hedgers, a global agent, to the underlying market. Hedgers who have option contracts trade the underlying asset to keep a delta neutral position. This hedge behavior is called dynamic hedging. We simulate two scenarios; one is the hedge with low frequency and the other is the hedge with high frequency that hedger can send hedge order anytime when hedge miss appears. We confirmed that dynamic hedging increases or decreases the volatility of the underlying market under certain conditions."

Whether VPIN is more strongly correlated with volume or volatility depends on the exact implementation. Hence, it is crucial for the interpretation of VPIN as a harbinger of market turbulence or as a predictor of short-term volatility to control for current volume and volatility. Doing so, we find no evidence of incremental predictive power of VPIN for future volatility. Likewise, VPIN does not attain unusual extremes prior to the flash crash. Moreover, the properties of VPIN are strongly dependent on the underlying trade classification. In particular, using more standard classification techniques, VPIN behaves in the exact opposite manner of what is portrayed in ELO (2011a, 2012a). At a minimum, ELO should rationalize this systematic reversal as the classification becomes more closely aligned with individual transactions.ELO (2014) dispute our findings. This note reviews the econometric methodology and the market microstructure arguments behind our conclusions and responds to a number of inaccurate assertions. In addition, we summarize fresh empirical evidence that corroborates the hypothesis that VPIN is largely driven, and significantly distorted, by the volume and volatility innovations. Furthermore, we note there is compelling new evidence that transaction-based classification schemes are more accurate than the bulk volume strategies advocated by ELO for constructing VPIN. In fact, using perfect classification leads to diametrically opposite results relative to ELO (2011a, 2012a). © 2013 Elsevier B.V."

This study examines the human capital disclosure practices of listed services companies in Malaysia. The study uses a qualitative approach of content analysis to analyze disclosure in the 2009 annual reports of companies. The fndings reveal that human capital disclosure varies across industries. This study indicates that majority of frms (in trading and services, fnance, and hotel industries) generally provide more information on the related attribute of ""employees"". Among the three industries, the fnance industry provides the highest frequency. However, frms in the technology industry disclose more information on attributes related to ""training and development"". These fndings indicate that the nature of work expectation leads to variance of disclosure on human capital attributes (HCA) among frms within the services industries. Technology frms disclose more information on training and development to indicate that these attributes will help their employees stay updated with new developments in the technology industry. This study also indicates that there is inconsistency in disclosing HCA among frms in the services industry. Firms in the fnance, technology, and hotel industries disclose more information on ""facilities and benefts provided"" whereas frms in the trading and services industry disclose more on attributes related to ""effort for human capital development""."

To achieve this, we conduct an experiment with an empirical tick data set of EUR/USD options on currency futures of four weeks. An essential advantage of our approach is the simultaneous pricing across different strike prices and parsimonious use of input variables. Nevertheless, we also have to take particular limitations into account, which give us useful hints for further research and steps. Copyright © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."

First, the jump dynamics of equities are sensitive to data sampling frequency with significant underestimation of jump intensities at lower frequencies. Second, although arrival densities of positive jumps and negative jumps are symmetric across different time scales, the magnitude of jumps is distributed asymmetrically at high frequencies.

It is shown that, in such settings, alternatives of asymmetric gamma kernel estimators are superior, but also differ in asymptotic and finite sample performance conditionally on the shape of the density near zero and the exact form of the chosen kernel. Therefore, a refined version of the gamma kernel with an additional tuning parameter adjusted according to the shape of the density close to the boundary is suggested. A data-driven method for the appropriate choice of the modified gamma kernel estimator is also provided. An extensive simulation study compares the performance of this refined estimator to those of standard gamma kernel estimates and standard boundary corrected and adjusted fixed kernels.

However, many factors contribute to the complexity of developing such integrated decision-making systems. Some of these factors include: the inherent diversity of financial assets, the heterogeneity of trading and risk assessment strategies, and the highly dynamic nature of financial markets. Moreover, the large volume of data to be analyzed severely affects the system's ability to make timely decisions, especially, for high-frequency trading.

We describe procedures for removal of outliers, normalization of feature points, computation of weights of features, and classification of test points. The complexity of computation at each quote received is proportional to the number of features. In addition, processing of indicators is parallelizable and, therefore, suitable in high-frequency domains. Experiments are presented for different prediction time intervals and confidence thresholds. Predictions made 10 to 2000 milliseconds before a price change resulted in an accuracy that ranged monotonically from 97% to 75%.

The model utilizes similarity ratio of the return fractals as the basis for forecasting. We argue that a collection of past returns such as moving average statistics can be 'expanded' to generate future returns through the similarity ratios by trading time multiples. We also argue that stock returns with fractal dimensions in excess of 1.5, the norm for market efficiency, may be prone to frequent jumps and discontinuity. The paper builds an econometrically testable model to estimate fractal dimensions to offer an alternative way to forecast return volatilities without having to estimate separately the bipower variation and the jumps in existing studies.

Financial economists approach finance theory by focusing on whether to reject a pricing model based on hypothesis tests. However, this approach often fails to capture aspects of the model and latent information in the data that could be potentially useful to the investor. Owing to these limitations, investors have increasingly turned to high-frequency trading as a means of achieving risk-mitigated wealth appreciation. High frequency trading is a strategy that relies on professional proprietary formula-driven trading algorithms to execute millisecond trades using high-speed computers that are placed near or in the proximity of the exchanges to reduce order latency time. The contemporary impact of this new approach has increased the speed and complexity of trading, and has had an impact on market liquidity and transparency. In turn, this has attracted the attention of regulators who are ""Clamping Down on Rapid Trades in the Stock Market"" [3] and the risk of such trades to create volatility by flooding the market with orders before canceling these same orders in fractions of seconds. Facing the possibility of regulatory oversight, many highfrequency automated traders are now turning to the alternative of near high-frequency trading. Instead of focusing on strategies to implement strategic runs in the millisecondenvironment, using the highest resolution data available, near high-frequency trading solves complex econometric models on an instrument by instrument basis to predict the profitability of a future trade. In this paper we present a theory of stochastic price formation to form a behavioral near high frequency automated trading system. The new system is actuated by a combining dual radial basis function artificial neural networks and two fundamental trading metrics. Additionally, because the trading signals are generated by cognitive models, the research calibrates a nonparametric behavioral production function to estimate the quasi elasticity coefficients of a four factor model. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The liquidity measurement literature has established standard measures of liquidity that apply to broad categories of market microstructure data. Specialized measures of liquidity have been developed to deal with data limitations in specific markets, to provide proxies from daily data, and to assess institutional trading programs. The general liquidity literature has established local cross-sectional patterns, global cross-sectional patterns, and time-series patterns. Commonality in liquidity is prevalent. Certain exchange designs enhance market liquidity: a limit order book for high volume markets, a hybrid exchange for low volume markets, and multiple competing exchanges. Automatic execution increases speed, but increases spreads. A tick size reduction yields a large improvement in liquidity. Providing ex-post transparency to an otherwise opaque market dramatically improves liquidity. Opening up the limit order book improves liquidity. Regulatory reforms that increase the number of competitive alternatives, move toward linking them up, and level the playing field between exchanges improves liquidity. High-frequency traders trade in both a passive, liquidity-supplying manner and an aggressive, liquidity-demanding manner. Their overall impact improves both liquidity and price efficiency, but concerns remain regarding occasional trading glitches, order anticipation strategies, and latency arbitrage at the expense of slow traders. The liquidity and corporate finance literature provides abundant evidence that liquidity is beneficial in many corporate settings: liquidity increases the power of governance via exit, reduces the cost of governance via intervention, facilitates the entrance of informed traders who produce valuable information about the firm, enhances the effectiveness of equity-based compensation to managers, reduces the cost of equity financing, mitigates trading frictions investors encounter when trading in the market to recreate a preferred payout policy, and lowers the immediate transaction costs and subsequent liquidity costs for firms conducting large share repurchases. Further, the influence goes both ways. There is evidence that firms influence their own liquidity through a broad range of corporate decisions including internal governance standards, equity issuance form and pricing, share repurchases, acquisition targets, and disclosure timeliness and quality. The literature on liquidity and asset pricing demonstrates that both average liquidity cost and liquidity risk are priced, liquidity enhances market efficiency, and liquidity strengthens the arbitrage linkage between related markets. We conclude with directions for future research. © 2014 C. W. Holden, S. Jacobsen and A. Subrahmanyam."

In relation to this, market abuse activities such as front running and quote stuffing, dark pools and flash orders, hedge funds insider trading and high yield securities investment fraud, high frequency trading, credit default swaps and short selling will be briefly analysed. This is done to investigate whether the current South African anti-market abuse enforcement framework is robust enough to effectively combat these activities. This is further aimed at exposing certain challenges embedded in the South African anti-market abuse enforcement framework in relation to the prevention and combating of the aforementioned practices in the financial markets in South Africa. To this end, the article seeks to explore these challenges by, first, examining the adequacy of the South African anti-market abuse enforcement framework with regard to the combating of front running and quote stuffing. Secondly, the adequacy of the South African anti-market abuse enforcement framework with regard to the curbing of dark pools and flash orders will be discussed. Thirdly, the adequacy of the aforesaid enforcement framework will be examined in relation to the combating of hedge funds insider trading and high yield securities investment fraud.

Toward this aim, over the last few years, internet-based communication platforms and search engines have been used to extract early indicators of social and economic trends. Here, we used Twitter's social networking platform to model and forecast the EUR/USD exchange rate in a high-frequency intradaily trading scale.

We provide a model-free option pricing approach with neural networks, which can be applied to real-time pricing and hedging of FX options. In contrast to well-known theoretical models, an essential advantage of our approach is the simultaneous pricing across different strike prices and parsimonious use of real-time input variables. To test its ability for the purpose of high-frequency trading, we perform an empirical run-time trading simulation with a tick dataset of EUR/USD options on currency futures of 4 weeks. In very short non-overlapping 15-minute out-of-sample intervals, theoretical option prices derived from the Black model compete against nonparametric option prices through two different neural network topologies. We show that the approximated pricing function of learning networks is suitable for generating fast run-time option pricing evaluation as their performance is slightly better in comparison to theoretical prices. The derivation of the network function is also useful for performing hedging strategies. We conclude that the performance of closed-form pricing models depends highly on the volatility estimator, whereas neural networks can avoid this estimation problem but require market liquidity for training. Nevertheless, we also have to take particular enhancements into account, which give us useful hints for further research and steps. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

This paper documents the presence of small and large jumps in the stochastic process of the CO2 futures price. The large jumps have a discrete origin, i.e. they can arise from various demand factors or institutional decisions on the tradable permits market. Contrary to the existing literature, we show that the stochastic process of carbon futures prices does not contain a continuous component (Brownian motion). The results are derived by using high-frequency data in the activity signature function framework (Todorov and Tauchen in J Econom 154:125-138, 2010; Todorov and Tauchen in J Bus Econ Stat 29:356-371, 2011). The implication is that the carbon futures price should be modeled as an appropriately sampled, centered Lévy or Poisson process.

Price movement was examined in trade-by-trade (tick) data along with temporal timespans between 1 s to 30 min for 52 one-week periods for one highly-traded stock. We hypothesize that much of the initial predictability of trade-by-trade (tick) data is due to traditional market dynamics, or the bouncing of the price between the stock's bid and ask. Only after timespans of between 5 to 10 s does this cease to explain the predictability; after this timespan, two consecutive movements in the same direction occur with higher probability than that of movements in the opposite direction.

Several statistical measures were applied to the predictions and standard errors to evaluate the performance of all models. A Jordan net that used as input the coefficients resulting from a non-decimated wavelet-based multi-resolution decomposition of an exogenous signal showed a consistent superior forecasting performance. Reasonable forecasting accuracy for the one-, three- and five step-ahead horizons was achieved by the proposed model. The procedure used to build the neuro-wavelet model is reusable and can be applied to any high-frequency financial series to specify the model characteristics associated with that particular series.

Fast traders' ability to revise their quotes quickly after news arrivals helps to reduce the inefficiency that is rooted in the risk of being picked off, which increases trade. However, their presence induces slow traders to strategically submit limit orders with a lower execution probability, thereby reducing trade. Because speed is a source of market power, it enables fast traders to extract rents from other market participants and triggers a costly arms race that reduces social welfare. The model generates a number of testable implications concerning the effects of high-frequency trading in limit order markets. © 2014 Elsevier B.V."

Whilst many common approaches only consider the bid-ask spread when measuring market impact, the authors aim to analyse the detailed limit order book data, which has more informational content. Design/methodology/approach: Using data from the London Stock Exchange's electronic SETS platform, the authors transform limit order book compositions into volume-weighted average price curves and accordingly estimate market impact. The regression coefficients of these curves are estimated, and their intraday patterns are revealed using a nonparametric kernel regression model. Findings: The authors find that market impact is nonlinear, time-varying, and asymmetric. Inferences drawn from marginal probabilities regarding Granger-causality do not show a significant impact of slope coefficients on the opposite side of the limit order book, thus implying that each side of the market is simultaneously rather than sequentially influenced by prevailing market conditions. Research limitations/implications: Results show that intraday seasonality patterns of liquidity may be exploited through trade scheduling algorithms in an attempt to minimise the trading costs associated with large institutional trades. Originality/value: The use of the detailed limit order book to reveal intraday patterns in liquidity provision offers better insight into the interactions of market participants.

Estimation results show that monetary policy surprises have economically important and highly significant effects on the level and volatility of energy futures prices and their trading volumes. I find that, on average, a hypothetical unanticipated 100-basis-point hike in the federal funds target rate is associated with roughly a 3% decrease in West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices.

Using data-based simulations we obtain estimates of the probability that a given intraday range is (upward or downward) biased or not, which we use for a more refined bias-adjustment of the realized range estimator. Both Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application involving a liquid and a relatively illiquid S&P500 constituent demonstrate that ex post measures and ex ante forecasts based on the heuristically adjusted realized range compare favorably to existing bias-adjusted (two time scales) realized range and (two time scales) realized variance estimators. © 2013 Elsevier Inc."

Past duration and trading intensity are used as information related order flow variables in modelling time between transactions in two new specifications of Autocorrelation Conditional Duration (ACD) models. This allows for specific investigation of non-linear asymmetric effects on expected duration and the impact of OTC transactions. Evidence is presented of two main types of trading episodes of increased and decreased trading intensity. Both have a significant impact on price volatility, which increases further if an OTC transaction intrudes. OTC transactions also play a dual role. They slow down trading activity in the short term (over the next five transactions) but increase it substantially in the long term (over ten transactions). Both the liquidity and information price impact components increase following an OTC trade, but the information impact is greater. Price volatility calms down faster than liquidity effects following an OTC trade, and this is more pronounced in ECX and in Phase II. The combined evidence points towards increased market depth, efficiency and maturity of the trading environment. © 2013 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois."

In this way, one can implement a simple trading strategy based on the predicted future value of an asset price or a portfolio and comparing it to the current value. The method is tested on FOREX data series and achieved a considerable profit on the mid price. In the presence of the bid-ask spread, the gain is smaller but it still ranges in the interval 2-6 percent in 6 months without using any leverage.

Most trading systems have concentrated on using common analytic waveforms and have not taken into consideration phasors and complex variables. The Hilbert transform, often employed to convert signal variables in analytic waveforms to complex variables, will be used for the measurement of market cycles, rather than measurement of market trends. The main objective is to investigate how the periods of the dominant cycle in a cycle mode can be quantified in order to create an amplitude compensation of the In-Phase and Quadrature components, alongside methods of smoothing and de-trending the analytic signal. The subsequent output can be defuzzified using Type 2 Fuzzy-Logic techniques, which will in turn refine the implementation of trading strategies. Type-2 Fuzzy Logic systems are becoming more popular as they account for uncertainties that are not captured within a Type-1 Fuzzy Logic system. These Type-2 systems outperform traditional Fuzzy Logic systems in forecasting problems since they can account for more variables in a more efficient way. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The questions rise if high frequency trading (HFT) provides more efficient, liquid markets and is economically beneficial. In this paper an algorithm based on statistical arbitrage is tested. Statistical arbitrage is a well-known trading strategy where profit arises from pricing inefficiencies between correlated financial instruments. An algorithm of statistical arbitrage tries to find a pair of correlated instruments that move together and take long/short positions when they diverge abnormally, hoping that the prices will converge in the near future. Recent computational expansion in financial modeling and the ever increasing demand for order execution speed is moving market making and price discovery strategies into high frequency trading (HFT) or the milliseconds realm, where HFT already generates nearly 2/3 of the overall trading volume. In this report we apply high frequency data from NYMEX exchange to test a trading system based on statistical arbitrage in one of the most liquid futures market, i.e. natural gas futures. The overall results suggest that statistical arbitrage in HFT environment significantly outperforms traditional trading strategies, provides liquidity to the markets and denies the efficient market hypothesis. © Vilnius University, 2002-2014 © Brno University of Technology, 2002-2014 © University of Latvia, 2002-2014."

Quantifying the deviations between the waiting-time distribution and the distribution generated by a random process may help unravel the feedback mechanisms that drive the underlying dynamics. We analyze the waiting-time distributions of high-frequency foreign exchange data for the best executable bid-ask prices across all major currencies. We find that the lognormal distribution yields a good overall fit for the waiting-time distribution between currency rate changes if both short and long waiting times are included. If we restrict our study to long waiting times, each currency pair's distribution is consistent with a power-law tail with exponent near to 3.5. However, for short waiting times, the overall distribution resembles one generated by an archetypal complex systems model in which boundedly rational agents compete for limited resources. Our findings suggest that a gradual transition arises in trading behavior between a fast regime in which traders act in a boundedly rational way and a slower one in which traders' decisions are driven by generic feedback mechanisms across multiple timescales and hence produce similar power-law tails irrespective of currency type. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Shortening of trading period and increasing the frequency of the trades clearly contributes to the growth of profits of securities dealers. The question remains whether this trading method offers the advantage to the investor himself, and whether the investor is able to take advantage of potential market inefficiencies to achieve aboveaverage profits in the short term period.

This model allows us to explain both qualitatively and quantitatively important stylized facts observed in the statistics of both microstructure and macrostructure returns, including the short-ranged correlation of returns, the long-ranged correlations of absolute returns, the microstructure noise and Epps effects. According to the microstructure noise effect, volatility is a decreasing function of the time-scale used to estimate it. The Epps effect states that cross correlations between asset returns are increasing functions of the time-scale at which the returns are estimated. The microstructure noise is explained as the result of the negative return correlations inherent in the definition of the bid-ask bounce component (ii). In the presence of a genuine correlation between the returns of two assets, the Epps effect is due to an average statistical overlap of the momentum of the returns of the two assets defined over a finite time-scale in the presence of the long memory process (i). © World Scientific Publishing Company."

Therefore, the liquidity demand also presents a higher frequency, and the change is more complex than the original situation. In recent years, many literatures are engaged in high-frequency trading (HFT) related research, and an important concern is the impact of HFT on market volatility and liquidity. Is it playing the role of stabilizing the market, or bringing more noise and turmoil? Based on this, the purpose of this study is trying to study what kind of impact the HFT have on market liquidity before and after the launch of the CSI 300 Index Futures. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses the simultaneous equations model of price and net order flow proposed by Deuskar and Johnson and for the first time introduces an asymmetric identification through heteroskedasticity (ITH) method. The paper applies the method to the high-frequency data of CSI 300 Index and the Futures and classifies the buying and selling orders through volume clock. The price risks are decomposed into a component driven by the impact of liquidity demand shocks (flow-driven risks (FDRs)) and a component driven by external information (information-driven risks (IDRs)). Findings – The empirical results show that the flow-driven risk of CSI 300 Index Futures is about 20 percent. In addition, before the introduction of the Index Futures, there is no asymmetric effect between liquidity demand shocks and price shocks existing in either CSI 300 Index or CSI 300 Index Futures. While after the introduction of stock Index Futures, the asymmetric effect in the both two markets emerges. The impact of the buying net order flows on the price is less than the impact of the selling net order flows on CSI 300 Index, whereas the impact of the buying net order flows on the price is larger than the impact of the selling net order flows on CSI 300 Index Futures. The paper further analyzes the relationship between liquidity and FDR and gets the conclusion that the reasons for the deterioration of the liquidity level are caused by the impact of the external information shocks, rather than the liquidity demand shocks. And entries of HFTs like arbitrage traders and hedge traders play a positive role in improving the liquidity level in the market. Originality/value – The paper introduces an asymmetric ITH method for the first time and finds asymmetric effect of the net order flow on the return in both CSI 300 Index market and the corresponding Index Futures market. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Exemplary applications include social content recommendation and algorithmic trading. The challenge is to balance the joint predictive performance of the nodes by exchanging information between them, while not letting communication overhead deteriorate the responsiveness of the service. Technically, the proposed protocol is based on controlling the variance of the local models in a decentralized way. This approach retains the asymptotic optimal regret of previous algorithms. At the same time, it allows to substantially reduce network communication, and, in contrast to previous approaches, it remains applicable when the data is non-stationary and shows rapid concept drift.

They provide some cross-section estimates of these measures using daily data over annual periods. In this paper we propose a method to estimate daily APIN and PSOS by extending the method in Tay et al. (2009) using high-frequency transaction data. Our empirical results show that while PIN is positively contemporaneously correlated with variance, APIN is not. On the other hand, PSOS is positively correlated with daily average effective spread and variance, which is consistent with the interpretation of PSOS as a measure of illiquidity. Compared to APIN, PSOS exhibits clustering and sporadic bursts over time. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Portfolio allocation is one of the most important problems in financial risk management. One most challenging part in portfolio allocation is the tremendous amount of data and the optimization procedures that require computing power beyond the currently available desktop systems. In this article, we focus on the portfolio allocation problem using high-frequency financial data, and propose a hybrid parallelization solution to carry out efficient asset allocations in a large portfolio via intra-day high-frequency data. We exploit a variety of HPC techniques, including parallel R, Intel Math Kernel Library, and automatic offloading to Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor in particular to speed up the simulation and optimization procedures in our statistical investigations. Our numerical studies are based on high-frequency price data on stocks traded in New York Stock Exchange in 2011. The analysis results show that portfolios constructed using high-frequency approach generally perform well by pooling together the strengths of regularization and estimation from a risk management perspective. We also investigate the computation aspects of large-scale multiple hypothesis testing for time series data. Using a combination of software and hardware parallelism, we demonstrate a high level of performance on high-frequency financial statistics. © 2014 IEEE."

Particularly, using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) stock price time series were analyzed following a fixed sub-band coding scheme, which provides a low time resolution for low frequencies and a high time resolution for high frequencies. Following the standard approach found in the literature, only low frequency components were considered as main features to predict stock prices. However, this approach lacks of details about the generative process of the original data. In this paper, we rely on DWT high frequency sub-band to extract short interval hidden information for better classification of future Standard and Poors (S&P500) one minute ahead direction using artificial neural network trained with backpropagation algorithm. The simulation results show that our approach that uses both low (approximation) and high (detail) frequency coefficients provides better classification rates than the standard one. In addition, simulation results show that low frequency components are appropriate to detect future downshifts in S&P500, whilst our approach is suitable to predict future upwards. Thus, the standard approach provides valuable information for risk averse investors trading S&P500, and our approach that combines low and high frequency coefficients is strongly useful for aggressive investors seeking short-term profits when trading S&P500. © World Scientific Publishing Company."

Looking at market transactions at the most granular levelâ""and taking into account market structure, price discovery, information flows, transaction costs, and the trading processâ""market microstructure also forms the basis of high-frequency trading strategies that can help professional investors generate profits and/or execute optimal transactions. Part of the Robert W. Kolb Series in Finance, Market Microstructure skillfully puts this discipline in perspective and examines how the working processes of markets impact transaction costs, prices, quotes, volume, and trading behavior. Along the way, it offers valuable insights on how specific features of the trading process like the existence of intermediaries or the environment in which trading takes place affect the price formation process.

Moreover, the realized volatility is adjusted to the information that flows into the market when it is closed. (ii) We forecast the one-day-ahead realized volatility using the ARFIMA and the HAR models. (iii) The accuracy of the realized volatility forecasts is investigated under the superior predictive ability framework. According to the predicted mean squared error, a simple ARFIMA model provides accurate one-trading day-ahead forecasts of CAC40 realized volatility.

In contrast to other existing approaches, the methodology used in this paper has the advantage of modeling all data within a single unified framework which allows one to disentangle the model-based news from each data release and subsequently to assess its impact on the forecast revision. The results show that the inclusion of high frequency data on energy and raw material prices in our data set contributes considerably to the gradual improvement of the model performance.

Recently, CPS extensions have been proposed for location-based services like vehicular networks, mobile social networking, and so on. Although current CPS middleware systems are dynamic in the way they support the joining and leaving of publishers and subscribers, they fall short in supporting subscription adaptations. These are becoming increasingly important across many CPS applications. In algorithmic high frequency trading, for instance, stock price thresholds that are of interest to a trader change rapidly, and gains directly hinge on the reaction time to relevant fluctuations rather than fixed values. In location-aware applications, a subscription is a function of the subscriber location (e.g. GPS coordinates), which inherently changes during motion. The common solution for adapting a subscription consists of a resubscription, where a new subscription is issued and the superseded one canceled. This incurs substantial overhead in CPS middleware systems, and leads to missed or duplicated events during the transition. In this article, we explore the concept of parametric subscriptions for capturing subscription adaptations. We discuss desirable and feasible guarantees for corresponding support, and propose novel algorithms for updating routing mechanisms effectively and efficiently in classic decentralized CPS broker overlay networks. Compared to resubscriptions, our algorithms significantly improve the reaction time to subscription updates without hampering throughput or latency under high update rates. We also propose and evaluate approximation techniques to detect and mitigate pathological cases of high frequency subscription oscillations, which could significantly decrease the throughput of CPS systems thereby affecting other subscribers. We analyze the benefits of our support through implementations of our algorithms in two CPS systems, and by evaluating our algorithms on two different application scenarios. © 2013 ACM."

We trace the evolution of the equity markets from stocks trading on the floor of the NYSE exchange via specialists (for listed stocks) and via NASDAQ market makers (for OTC stocks) to a current environment where stocks trade on numerous exchanges, and with only limited intervention from specialists and market makers, and where buyers and sellers are matched via electronic trading algorithms. We evaluate the pros and cons of this new environment and investigate what it means to traders now executing orders via algorithms. We investigate the different exchanges (NYSE, AMEX, ARCA, and NASDAQ), alternative venues (such as Bats and Edge), and dark pools (independent dark pool crosses, broker dealer crossing venues, and enhanced liquidity providers). Additionally, we provide an overview of the new pricing structures in the market including liquidity rebates, maker-taker pricing models, and the effect of high frequency and algorithmic trading on the price discovery process.

Because empirical econophysics lacks controllability that is needed to study the impacts of different external conditions and computational econophysics has to adopt artificial decision-making processes that are often deviated from those of real humans, experimental econophysics tends to overcome these problems by offering controllability and using real humans in laboratory experiments. However, to our knowledge, the existing laboratory experiments have not convincingly reappeared the stylized facts (say, scaling) that have been revealed for real economic/financial markets by econophysicists. A most important reason is that in these experiments, discrete trading time makes these laboratory markets deviated from real markets where trading time is naturally continuous. Here we attempt to overcome this problem by designing a continuous double-auction stock-trading market and conducting several human experiments in laboratory. As an initial work, the present artificial financial market can reproduce some stylized facts related to clustering and scaling. Also, it predicts some other scaling in human behavior dynamics that is hard to achieve in real markets due to the difficulty in getting the data. Thus, it becomes possible to study real stock markets by conducting controlled experiments on such laboratory stock markets producing high frequency data.© EDP Sciences Società Italiana di Fisica Springer-Verlag 2013."

Empirical analyses indicate that the former explains a significant part of the co-movement and the latter is unlikely to play an important role. We extend the analysis to intra-day high-frequency data. For example, when the Tokyo Stock Exchange begins its daily trading at 9:00 A.M. Japan Standard Time (JST), stock prices in Tokyo exhibit responses to preceding changes in New York. An analysis with minute-byminute data indicates that Tokyo's response to New York dissipates within about six minutes after opening. On the other hand, when the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) opens at 9:30 A.M. Eastern Standard Time (EST), its response to Tokyo dissipates within 14 minutes. Thus, the movement of stock prices is transmitted rapidly across countries. Finally real-time simultaneous interactions between Shanghai (Shenzhen) and Tokyo are analyzed for a 30-minute period in the morning and a 60-minute period in the afternoon. Investors in Tokyo are watching stock prices in Shanghai, but not vice versa.

Nothing short of a groundbreaking shift has occurred in the securities industry as the transition has been made from predominantly manual, human intermediated trading to predominantly electronic trading. By many measures, commission, spreads and market impact costs have been dramatically reduced in recent years. But does that mean that market quality has improved? That is the key question addressed in this book, titled after the Baruch College Conference, ""The Quality of Our Financial Markets: Taking Stock of Where We Stand."" Featuring contributions from a distinguished panel of practitioners, academicians, and regulators, this volume offers a penetrating and timely account of the most current issues in market quality, covering such topics as high-frequency trading; the Flash Crash of May 6th, 2010; dark pools; lit pools; fragmentation; disruptive and advanced technologies. And, very significantly, it takes a close look at the impact and influence of regulation. The Zicklin School of Business Financial Markets Series presents the insights emerging from a sequence of conferences hosted by the Zicklin School at Baruch College for industry professionals, regulators, and scholars. Much more than historical documents, the transcripts from the conferences are edited for clarity, perspective and context; material and comments from subsequent interviews with the panelists and speakers are integrated for a complete thematic presentation. Each book is focused on a well delineated topic, but all deliver broader insights into the quality and efficiency of the U.S. equity markets and the dynamic forces changing them. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.

Even as computerized tools undoubtedly provide individual investors with more power relative to what they had before, they also provide powerful actors with relatively more power as well, in some cases effectively excluding the majority of individuals from insight or meaningful participation whatsoever, especially with regard to the political impacts of market activities. Reports on recent financial crises, and the 2011 film Margin Call provide narrow windows into the operations of HFT and the challenges it poses to democracy; these in turn raise significant problems for the view that computerization inherently democratizes. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

The winning system builds upon the optimal composition of several models and a feature extraction and selection strategy. We used Random Forest as a modeling technique to train all sub-models as a function of an optimal feature set. The modeling approach can cope with highly complex data having low Maximal Information Coefficients between the dependent variable and the feature set and provides a feature ranking metric which we used in our feature selection algorithm.

The most prominent example of an HFT environment is within equity trading, where many millions of trades are achieved at a high volume to gain a reasonable cumulative profit. Such environments rely on low latency/high performance technologies to allow trades to react in a timely manner to market volatility. However, sometimes the volatility of the market goes beyond what supporting infrastructure can allow, resulting in erroneous behaviour of the marketplace. In this paper we tackle the problem of managing market volatility to limit erroneous market behaviour. Our approach is unique in that it is non-dependent on the trading environment itself and self-regulates based only on trading frequency and contention. We demonstrate our results and show that by managing trade injection rates and contention of shared state the volatility of HFT environments can be managed appropriately and in an automated manner. © 2013 IEEE."

We derive a noise-robust Hayashi-Yoshida estimator that allows for very general structure of jumps in the underlying process. Based on the new estimator, different aspects and components of co-volatility are compared to examine the effect of jumps on systematic risk using tick-by-tick data from the Chinese stock market during 2009-2011. We find controlling for jumps contributes significantly to the beta estimation and common jumps mostly dominate the jump's effect, but there is also evidence that idiosyncratic jumps may lead to significant deviation. We also find that not controlling for noise and jumps in previous realized beta estimations tend to considerably underestimate the systematic risk. © 2013 Elsevier B.V."

What does it mean for a financial market to be ""fair""? We first examine how high frequency trading is actually used. High frequency traders often implement traditional beneficial strategies such as market making and arbitrage, although computers can also be used for manipulative strategies as well. We then examine different notions of fairness. Procedural fairness can be viewed from the perspective of equal opportunity, in which all market participants are treated alike. The same rules apply to HFT as to other traders. Another approach to fairness is in the equality of outcomes. Many HFT strategies are beneficial to other market participants, so one cannot categorically denounce the practice as unfair. Other strategies, for both high and low frequency trading, are not. It is thus important to distinguish between the technology and the use of the technology to make judgments on fairness. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."

Motivated by these studies, we divide each trading day into 13 half-hour trading intervals and measure information asymmetry from price changes, trade sizes, and trade directions. We find that information asymmetry starts high in the morning, drops continuously until it reaches a midday low during Interval 7, rises to a midday high during Interval 10, and drops continuously after. In contrast, neither the spread nor the depth exhibit similar midday extreme values. Essentially, we identify a 90-min window in the afternoon when net valuable information arrives to the market in high frequency while liquidity is stable, and that may be an opportunity for some investors to time their trades. In addition, we show that market makers employ dynamic strategies that change the spread, the depth, or both to manage information asymmetry. This is particularly evident during the last three trading intervals, where the significant drop in information asymmetry is countered primarily by a significant increase in the depth while the spread is almost constant. © 2013 International Review of Finance Ltd. 2013."

In the proposed trading system, we use a genetic algorithm as a pre-screening tool to search suitable indicators for RRL trading. Moreover, we modify the original RRL parameter update scheme in the literature for out-of-sample trading. Empirical studies are conducted based on data sets of 238 S&P stocks. It is found that the trading performance concerning the out-of-sample daily Sharpe ratios turns better: the number of companies with a positive and significant Sharpe ratio increases after feeding the selected indicators jointly with prices information into the RRL system."

Significant technological investments have led to dramatic improvements in latency, the delay between a trading decision and the resulting trade execution. We describe a theoretical model for the quantitative valuation of latency. Our model measures the trading frictions created by the presence of latency, by considering the optimal execution problem of a representative investor. Via a dynamic programming analysis, our model provides a closed-form expression for the cost of latency in terms of well-known parameters of the underlying asset. We implement our model by estimating the latency cost incurred by trading on a human time scale. Examining NYSE common stocks from 1995 to 2005 shows that median latency cost across our sample roughly tripled during this time period. Furthermore, using the same data set, we compute a measure of implied latency and conclude that the median implied latency decreased by approximately two orders of magnitude. Empirically calibrated, our model suggests that the reduction in cost achieved by going from trading on a human time scale to a low latency time scale is comparable with other execution costs faced by the most cost efficient institutional investors, and it is consistent with the rents that are extracted by ultra-low latency agents, such as providers of automated execution services or high frequency traders. © 2013 INFORMS."

In addition, taking 5 min high-frequency trading data of CSI300 index futures as example, the out-of-sample daily volatility predictions calculated by using rolling predicting method, and a bootstrap MCS test is used to evaluate the predicting accuracy for the proposed model and other 7 models.

This study argues for more extensive understanding of the phenomena as dynamics previously viewed unrelated now exhibit correlation. As empirical reference, this research relies on recent trends in the commodity futures contracts with analytical relation to the currency exchange rate and by extension the financial and real sectors. With varying intensity often speculative sporadic trading in crude oil, coffee, wheat, rice, sugar, and gold benchmark futures may inflict detrimental effects on the global development efforts. The issue is most acute in the emerging markets facing inflation fears, speculative movements of foreign currency-denominated funds, and underlying domestic currency value. This dynamic reasserts the concept of fundamental uncertainty allowing us to connect the typical risk-return stand with a dialectical unity of the financial, real sector, and social costs. Ultimately, issues raised in this study relate to the problems of social stability and sustained economic development in the postcrisis environment given high frequency and volatility of capital flows. As such, this chapter contributes to the literature that bridges financial empirical analysis with modern socially responsible economic development.

In fact, the traders themselves have been replaced by algorithms (machines) operating with little or no human oversight. While the process of electronic trading is not visible to a human eye, machine-learning methods have been developed to recognize persistent patterns in the data. In this study, we develop a dynamic machine-learning method that designates traders in an anonymous electronic market into five persistent categories: high frequency traders, market makers, opportunistic traders, fundamental traders, and small traders. Our method extends a plaid clustering technique with a smoothing framework that filters out transient patterns.

In a market order, the trade occurs at the best available price on the opposite side of the book. In a limit order, on the other hand, the trader specifies a price (lower limit in case of sell orders and higher limit in case of buy orders) beyond which they are not willing to transact. Limit orders supply liquidity to the market and aid in price discovery since they indicate the prices that traders are willing to pay at any point of time. One of the risks that a trader placing a limit order faces is the risk of delayed execution or non-execution. If the execution is delayed, then the trader also faces a “picking-off” risk, in the event of the arrival of new information. With these issues in the background, a trader placing a limit order at a certain price, given various economic variables such as recent price movements as well as characteristics of the company in question, is interested in the probability of execution of the order as a function of subsequent elapsed time. For example, if she places a small sell order at 0.5 percent above the last traded price for a given stock, what is the probability that the order will be executed in the next t minutes? With this motivation, this paper considers execution times of small limit orders in an electronic exchange, specifically the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India. Order execution times have been studied in several other works, where they are modeled by reconstructing the history of the order book using high-frequency data. Here, for the first time, the much simpler approach of small hypothetical orders placed at certain prices at certain points of time has been used. Given that an order has been placed at a certain price, subsequent price movements determine the lower and upper bounds of the time to execution based on when (and if) the order price is first reached and when it is first crossed. Survival analysis with interval censoring is used to model the execution probability of an order as a function of time. Several Accelerated Failure Time models are built with historical trades and order book data for 50 stocks over 63 trading days. Additionally, choice of distributions, relative importance of covariates, and model reduction are discussed; and results qualitatively consistent with studies that did not use hypothetical orders are obtained. Interestingly, for the data, the differences between the above-mentioned bounds are not very large. Directly using them without interval censoring gives survival curves that bracket the correct curve obtained with interval censoring. The paper concludes that this approach, though data- and computation-wise much less intensive than traditional approaches, nevertheless yields useful insights on execution probabilities of small limit orders in electronic exchanges. © 2013, SAGE Publications Ltd.

We show that, over short time intervals, price changes are mainly driven by the order flow imbalance (OFI), defined as the imbalance between supply and demand at the best bid and ask prices. Our study reveals a linear relation between OFI and price changes, with a slope inversely proportional to the market depth. These results are shown to be robust to intraday seasonality effects, and stable across time scales and across stocks. This linear price impact model, together with a scaling argument, implies the empirically observed ""square-root"" relation between the magnitude of price moves and trading volume, but this relation is found to be noisy and less robust than the one based onOFI. We discuss a potential application ofOFI as a measure of adverse selection in limit order executions and discuss the implications for intraday volatility dynamics. © The Author, 2013.

We propose a simple model of latency arbitrage in which a single security is traded on two exchanges, with aggregate information available to regular traders only after some delay. An infinitely fast arbitrageur profits from market fragmentation by reaping the surplus when the two markets diverge due to this latency in cross-market communication. We develop a discrete-event simulation system to capture this processing and information transfer delay, and using an agent-based approach, we simulate the interactions between highfrequency and zero-intelligence trading agents at the millisecond level. We then evaluate allocative efficiency and market liquidity arising from the simulated order streams, and we find that market fragmentation and the presence of a latency arbitrageur reduces total surplus and negatively impacts liquidity. By replacing continuous-time markets with periodic call markets, we eliminate latency arbitrage opportunities and achieve further efficiency gains through the aggregation of orders over short time periods.

The study finds evidence of herding by both investors but a stronger herding tendency among institutional than among individual investors. Institutional investors herd more on firms with small capitalizations and lower turnovers and they follow positive feedback strategies. The portfolios that institutional investors herd buy outperform those they sell by an average of 1.009% during the 20. days after intense trading episodes. By contrast, individual investors herd more on firms with small sizes and higher turnovers, and they crowd to buy (sell) stocks with negative (positive) past returns. The portfolios that individual investors herd buy underperform those they sell by an average of 0.829% during the following 20. days. Moreover, these return differences of both investors are more pronounced under a market with higher pressure and among small stocks. These findings suggest that the herding of institutional investors speeds up the price-adjustment process and is more likely to be driven by correlated private information, while individual herding is most likely to be driven by behavior and emotions. © 2013 Elsevier Inc."

Design/methodology/approach – The DIA is designed to be one hundredth of the DJIA, the SPY is designed to be one tenth of the S&P 500 and QQQQ is designed to be one fortieth of the NASDAQ 100. This feature of ETFs requires the estimation of the difference between the proportional level of the index and the price of the ETF, which is the ETF pricing deviation. Findings – The paper finds that the DIA, SPY and QQQQ pricing deviations are 0.0429, -0.0743 and 0.4298, respectively. The findings indicate that the prices of DIA and QQQQ are on average lower than the underlying indexes. SPY is the exception having a price which is higher than the theoretical price of the S&P 500 index. The author finds that this is due to the increased demand for the SPY. Additionally, the paper provides an explanation for the large change (increase) in the pricing deviation of QQQQ after December 1, 2004 which DeFusco, Ivanov and Karels could not explain. On December 1, 2004 QQQQ trading was consolidated on NASDAQ. The paper finds negative growth in the volume of QQQQ after December 1, 2004 indicating decrease in popularity of this ETF. The decrease in popularity of QQQQ might explain the increase in its pricing deviation. Research limitations/implications – The paper uses high frequency data in the analysis of pricing deviation which might be artificially deflating standard errors and thus inflating the t-test significance values. Originality/value – The paper contributes to the ongoing search in the finance literature of precision ETF performance metrics. © 2013, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

It is shown that the LMACP nicely captures salient features of bid-ask spreads like the strong autocorrelation and discreteness of observations. We discuss theoretical properties of LMACP models and evaluate rolling-window forecasts of quoted bid-ask spreads for stocks traded at NYSE and NASDAQ. We show that Poisson time series models significantly outperform forecasts from AR, ARMA, ARFIMA, ACD and FIACD models. The economic significance of our results is supported by the evaluation of a trade schedule.

Why provide costly services to another species if the feedback of this provision also happens to benefit intra-specific competitors that provide no service? Rewarding cooperators and punishing defectors can help maintain mutualism; this is not possible, however, when one can only respond to the collective action of one's partners, which is likely to be the case in many common symbioses. We show how the theory of public goods can explain the stability of mutualism when discrimination between cooperators and defectors is not possible: if two groups of individuals trade goods that are non-linear, increasing functions of the number of contributions, their mutualistic interaction is maintained by the exchange of these public goods, even when it is not possible to punish defectors, which can persist at relatively high frequencies. This provides a theoretical justification and testable predictions for the evolution of mutualism in the absence of discrimination mechanisms. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd."

We find that, for majority of stocks, the scaling exponents of both distributions are systematically related by about a factor of 2 with the ones for the returns being larger. Second, we study the empirical price impact of trades of a given volume and find that this impact can be well described by a square-root dependence: r(V ) ~ V1/2.

The bid-ask spread of the LOB is modeled by a tick-valued continuous-time Markov chain. We consider a small agent who continuously submits limit buy/sell orders at best bid/ask quotes, and may also set limit orders at best bid (resp. ask) plus (resp. minus) a tick for obtaining execution order priority, which is a crucial issue in high-frequency trading. The agent faces an execution risk since her limit orders are executed only when they meet counterpart market orders. She is also subject to inventory risk due to price volatility when holding the risky asset. The agent can then also choose to trade with market orders, and therefore obtain immediate execution, but at a less favorable price. The objective of the market maker is to maximize her expected utility from revenue over a short-term horizon by a trade-off between limit and market orders, while controlling her inventory position. This is formulated as a mixed regime switching regular/impulse control problem that we characterize in terms of a quasi-variational system by dynamic programming methods. Calibration procedures are derived for estimating the transition matrix and intensity parameters for the spread and for Cox processes modelling the execution of limit orders. We provide an explicit backward splitting scheme for solving the problem and show how it can be reduced to a system of simple equations involving only the inventory and spread variables. Several computational tests are performed both on simulated and real data, and illustrate the impact and profit when considering execution priority in limit orders and market orders. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

They are widely used in high-frequency trading, seismic analysis and neuroscience. A critical numerical calculation in Hawkes process models is parameter estimation, which is used to fit a Hawkes process model to a data set. The parameter estimation problem can be solved by searching for a parameter set that maximises the log-likelihood. A core operation of this search process, the log-likelihood evaluation, is computationally demanding if the number of data points is large. To accelerate the computation, we present a log-likelihood evaluation strategy which is suitable for hardware acceleration. We then design and optimise a pipelined engine based on our proposed strategy. In the experiments, an FPGA-based implementation of the proposed engine is shown to be up to 72 times faster than a single-core CPU, and 10 times faster than an 8-core CPU. © 2013 IEEE."

The hereto paper compares two types of agent-based models, one with zero-intelligence traders and the other with intelligent traders in order to simulate the tick-by-tick high frequency trades on the stock market for the selected U.S. stocks. The simulations of the agent-based models are done with the help of Adaptive Modeler software application which uses the interaction of 2,000 heterogeneous agents to create a virtual stock market for the selected stock with the scope of forecasting the price. Within the intelligent agent-based model the population of agents is continuously adapting and evolving by using genetic programming in forming new agents by using the trading strategies of the best performing agents and replacing the worst performing agents in a process called breeding, while the zero-intelligence agent based model does not evolve, agents do not breed, and they trade in a random manner. After comparing the fitting of the two models with the real data, the results show that in almost all the cases the intelligent agent-based model performed better when compared to the zero-intelligence agent-based model, which could be interpreted as lower market efficiency, allowing for predictions of the stock market price, or even stock market manipulation. Also, the zero-intelligent agent-based model generates more trades and lower wealth for the population, compared to the intelligent agentbased model. The high-frequency data turns out to be very hard to simulate and analyse due to its particularities which differentiate them from daily data, as price changes are discrete, being multiples of the minimum price increment, the price changes not being independent."

An extreme case is high-frequency trading whereby saving a fraction of millisecond over a route between Chicago and New York can be a game-changer. While such communications are often carried by fiber, microwave links can reduce transmission delays over large distances due to more direct routes and faster wave propagation. In order to bridge large distances, information is sent over a multihop relay network. Motivated by these applications, this papers present an information-theoretic approach to the design of optimal multihop microwave networks that minimizes end-to-end transmission delay. To characterize the delay introduced by coding, we derive error exponents achievable in multihop networks. We formulate and solve an optimization problem that determines optimal selection of amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward relays.

In closed systems - such as those found in HPC - Infiniband, iWARP or RoCE are common choices as system architects have the opportunity to choose the best host configurations and networking fabric. However, the vast majority of networks are built upon Ethernet with nodes exchanging data using the standard TCP/IP stack. On such networks, achieving ultra low-latency while maintaining compatibility with a standard TCP/IP stack is crucial. To date, most efforts for low-latency packet transfers have focused on three main areas: (i) avoiding context switches, (ii) avoiding buffer copies, and (iii) off-loading protocol processing. This paper describes IBM PowerENTM and its networking stack, showing that an integrated system design which treats Ethernet adapters as first class citizens that share the system bus with CPUs and memory, rather than as peripheral PCI Express attached devices, is a winning solution for achieving minimal latency. The work presents outstanding performance figures, including 1.30μs from wire to wire for UDP, usually the chosen protocol for latency sensitive applications, and excellent latency and bandwidth figures for the more complex TCP. © 2013 IEEE."

Real estate businesses are always prone to news about change. However, little work has been done on the relationship between inside information and performance of real estate equities. This paper investigates the likelihood of informed trading in equities issued by real estate developers. The paper adopts the framework of probability of informed trading (PIN), using high-frequency data from Hong Kong. Compared with Tay, Ting, Tse, and Warachka (2009)'s logistic model, this study provides a new and better approach, with Pareto distribution, to model time-varying probabilities of news. Importantly, it tackles the floating-point (FP) problem arising from large loads of financial data in numerical computation, by giving a better solution. The findings suggest that the likelihood of informed trading in equities happens among real estate developers. Particularly, the equities of mainland-based developers with lower market values have a higher chance of informed trading than those issued by HK-based developers of high market values. Somehow, a diversified business is less likely to be associated with informed trading. Furthermore, the liquidity of equities has an effect of dilution on informed trading. While this study focuses on real estate equities data, its proposed approach can be applied to the detection of likelihood of informed trading in other sectors. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

First, we identify the parameters of the underlying VAR(1) model of asset prices and then the quantities of the corresponding Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process are estimated by pattern matching techniques. Portfolio optimization is performed according to two approaches: (i) maximizing the predictability by solving the generalized eigenvalue problem or (ii) maximizing the mean return. The optimization itself is carried out by stochastic search algorithms and Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNNs). The presented solutions satisfy the cardinality constraint thus providing sparse portfolios to minimize the transaction costs and to maximize interpretability of the results. The performance has been tested on historical data (SWAP rates, SP 500, and FOREX). The proposed trading algorithms have achieved 29.57% yearly return on average, on the examined data sets. The algorithms prove to be suitable for high frequency, intraday trading as they can handle financial data up to the arrival rate of every second. © 2013-IOS Press and the authors.

We quantify the market risk based on the study at a 30-min time horizon using modified GARCH models. The evaluation of intraday market risk can be useful to market participants (day traders and market makers) involved in frequent trading. As expected, the volatility features a significant intraday seasonality, which motivates us to include the intraday seasonal indexes in the GARCH models. We also incorporate realized variance (RV) and time-varying degrees of freedom in the GARCH models to capture more intraday information on the volatile market. The intrinsic tail risk index is introduced to assist with understanding the inherent risk level in each trading time interval. The proposed models are evaluated based on their forecasting performance of one-period-ahead volatility and Intraday Value-at-Risk (IVaR) with application to the 30 constituent stocks. We find that models with seasonal indexes generally outperform those without; RV can improve the out-of-sample forecasts of IVaR; student GARCH models with time-varying degrees of freedom perform best at 0.5 and 1 % IVaR, while normal GARCH models excel for 2. 5 and 5 % IVaR.

Second, volatility and trading volume are higher during announcement days with jumps than announcement days without jumps. Furthermore, volatility returns to the preannouncement level faster following scheduled news releases with jumps than after announcements without jumps.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper is a meta-analysis of the role of investment strategies within complex systems. Findings: The growth of hedge fund investment activity based on statistical arbitrage tends to produce a vulnerability; more funds using the strategy helps to create the profitable outcomes that the strategy relies upon. However, the growth also reduces the time lines of profitability and produces an underlying instability based on overlapping holdings and the use of leverage. The shortened timelines also create a further impetus towards technological competition and promotes high frequency trading, which then introduces further vulnerabilities based on ""stop-loss cascades"". Research limitations/implications: Much of the trading creates a superficial form of liquidity, which gives a limited sense of market vulnerabilities. The basis of complex interactions between high frequency traders is also not clearly understood. Researchers and agents of policy ought to pay greater attention to the issues than is currently the case.

Above a particular time-threshold, humans and robots trade with one another; below the threshold all transactions are robot-to-robot. We refer to this abrupt system transition as the 'robot phase transition'. Here, we conduct controlled experiments where human traders interact with 'robot' trading agents in minimal models of electronic financial markets to see if correlates of the two regimes suggested by Johnson et al. (2012) occur in such laboratory conditions. Our results indicate that when trading robots act on a super-human timescale, the market starts to fragment, with statistically lower human-robot interactions than we would expect from a fully mixed market.

This contribution has risen from zero in 2003. The operation of the electricity grid depends heavily on knowledge of the variability of supply. Wind farm output displays similar conditional volatility as financial market variables. In this paper, a new method of estimating wind farm output volatility on a 5-min time scale is developed through the use of higher-frequency wind farm output data. First, an autoregressive model for the high-frequency data is developed, and it is used to derive a volatility measure for 5-min data.

In particular, we show that HFTs reduce (increase) the prices that LTs receive when selling (buying) their equity holdings. (ii) Although PTs lose revenue in every trade intermediated by HFTs, they are compensated with a higher liquidity discount in the market price. (iii) HF trading increases the microstructure noise of prices. (iv) The volume of trades increases as the HFTs intermediate trades between the LTs and PTs. This additional volume is a consequence of trades which are carefully tailored for surplus extraction and are neither driven by fundamentals nor is it noise trading.

Specifically, we address the question as to whether decisions to open or close a position are different when investors already hold a position compared with when they do not. Based on a unique data set from an electronic foreign exchange trading platform, OANDA FXTrade, we find that investors' future order flow is (significantly) driven by past price movements and that these predictive patterns last up to several hours. This observation clearly shows that for high-frequency trading, investors rely on previous price movements in making future investment decisions. We provide clear evidence that market and limit orders flows are much more predictable if those orders are submitted to close an existing position than if they are used to open one. We interpret this finding as evidence for the existence of a monitoring effect, which has implications for theoretical market microstructure models and behavioral finance phenomena, such as the endowment effect. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

Onset and offset phases of volatility are computed by means of the hierarchical factor segmentation (HFS) algorithm based on high-frequency data. Through these computed volatility phases we search for dynamic patterns by resolving two questions: Is a return's volatility closely associated with significant price changes?, and can we derive an early prediction of the sign of the price change at the offset? Can volatility phases reveal which dimension-return, volume or trading number-is the driving force behind the others? Some computed new features of stock dynamics are counter-intuitive. Almost all significant price changes are marked by volatility within the three dimensions. We develop a data-driven potential-based model to make early predictions of the sign of significant price differences at the end of a volatile period. This model recognizes that when a stock's dynamic enters a volatility state, it typically settles into a subtle imbalance of oscillations between positive and negative returns, and leads to a significant price difference at the offset of volatility. We develop a new statistical analysis to show that a return's volatility onset is more likely to fall behind the onsets of volume and trading number, while the latter two dimensions are very well-correlated with each other. By incorporating this result with behavioral evidence extracted from scatterplots of the logarithm of volume versus the trading number, we postulate that stock dynamics are chiefly driven by a large group of participants, whose collective large-volume trading action is potentially responsible for stimulating volatility in both return and trading number. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

High-frequency trading data arrive at random times. By combining stochastic and agent-based approaches, we develop a model for trading time, trading volume, and price changes. We generate intertrade time (time between successive trades) Δ ti, and the number of shares traded q(Δ ti) as two independent but power-law autocorrelated processes, where Δ ti is subordinated to q(Δ ti), and Δ ti is more strongly correlated than q(Δ ti). These two power-law autocorrelated processes are responsible for the emergence of strong power-law correlations in (a) the total number of shares traded N(ΔT) and (b) the share volume Q ΔT calculated as the sum of the number of shares q i traded in a fixed time interval ΔT. We find that even though q(Δ ti) is weakly power-law correlated, due to strong power-law correlations in Δ ti, the (integrated) share volume Q(ΔT) ≡Σ ΔT i=1q(Δt i) exhibits strong long-range power-law correlations. We propose that intertrade times and bid-ask price changes share the same volatility mechanism, yielding the power-law autocorrelations in absolute values of price change and power-law tails in the distribution of price changes. The model generates the log-linear functional relationship between the average bid-ask spread 〈S〉 ΔT and the number of trade occurrences N ΔT, and between 〈S〉 ΔT and Q ΔT.

A new feature of this model is that limit orders are allowed to arrive in multiple sizes, an important empirical feature of the order book. We can compute various quantities of interest without resorting to simulation, conditional on the state of the order book, such as the probability that the next move of the mid-price will be upward, or the probability, as a function of order size, that a limit ask order will be executed before a downward move in the mid-price.

Such ""audible"" ultrasound through bone-conduction is referred to as bone-conducted ultrasound (BCU). It have been reported that profoundly hearing-impaired people can also hear a BCU and recognize part of the information on the modulating signal from the amplitude-modulated BCU. These perceptual characteristics were utilized in the development of a new hearing-aid system, Bone-Conducted Ultrasonic Hearing Aids (BCUHA), for the profoundly hearing-impaired. In this study, to verify the feasibility of ""binaural"" BCUHAs, we investigated whether listeners can use the interaural time differences in the amplitude envelopes (envelope-ITDs) and the intensity differences (IIDs) as cues for lateralization of BCUs. Results showed that listeners can detect changes in envelope-ITDs or IIDs of BCUs. Also, the discrimination thresholds of the polarities of IIDs were compensated by envelope-ITDs, i.e., the time-intensity trading was observed in the BCU perception. These findings indicate that the auditory system has the ability for lateralization using envelope-ITDs and IIDs of bilaterally presented BCUs. Further, it suggest that bilaterally presented BCUs are processed in the auditory pathway associated with lateralization in a similar manner to high-frequency amplitude-modulated sounds. © 2012 IEEE."

It has been suggested that imitation of successful trader strategies by other less successful traders is an important factor in contributing to this persistence. We test this explanation by using an existing adaptive agent-based model and we find that the robustness of the model is directly related to the dynamics of learning; models in which learning converges to a stationary steady state fail to produce realistic time series data. In contrast, models in which learning leads to dynamic strategy switching behaviour in the steady state are able to reproduce the long memory phenomena. We demonstrate that a model which incorporates contrarian trading strategies results in more dynamic behaviour in steady state, and hence is able to produce more realistic results. We also demonstrate that a non-learning contrarian model that performs dynamic strategy switching produces long memory phenomena and therefore that learning is not necessary. Models that can be validated against properties of empirical high frequency financial data should allow exploration of the robustness and reliability qualities of market mechanism modifications.

Instead of focusing only on the scheduling aspect like Almgren and Chriss in [J. Risk, 3 (2000), pp. 5-39], or only on the liquidity-consuming orders like Obizhaeva and Wang in [Optimal Trading Strategy and Supply/Demand Dynamics, SSRN eLibrary, 2005], we link the optimal trade schedule to the price of the limit orders that have to be sent to the limit order book to optimally liquidate a portfolio. Most practitioners address these two issues separately: they compute an optimal trading curve, and they then send orders to the markets to try to follow it. The results obtained in this paper can be interpreted and used in two ways: (i) we solve simultaneously the two problems and provide a strategy to liquidate a portfolio over a few hours, and (ii) we provide a tactic for following a trading curve over slices of a few minutes. As far as the model is concerned, the interactions of limit orders with the market are modeled via a point process pegged to a diffusive ""fair price.""

Computers, softwares and networks are necessary tools for a cyberattack but can also of course be targets. We propose here to describe a new form of cyberterrorism (or cybercrime) attack, theoretical but with a high probability of realization: the cyberattack on the stock exchange market of some countries but with legal cyberweapons. Consequences of such an attack could be devastating for the financial and the non financial world. How is such an attack possible ? Well, at the New York Stock Exchange, May 6th 2010, an astonishing fact has happened: all financial transactions during 20 minutes have been purely ""deleted"". This is now called the Flash Crash. All details are not clearly understood, it seems that the so called ""quote stuffing"" (or stub quotes sometimes) used in conjunction with High Frequency Trading (HTF) is at the heart of this accidental incident. We have to point out that experts from SEC do not agree with this hypothesis. We propose in this paper here to describe a malicious version of the flash crash, this is a new cyberweapon that can attack a new target: Stock Exchanges places. More precisely, we propose to see this financial incident as it really is : a Denial Of Services (DOS) of a very new type that we will call a Denial Of Financial Services (DFOS). We remind that a DOS classical attack is simple to do and can be devastating, so it seems for the DFOS. The basic idea of the scenario of our malicious flash crash attack (MFCA) is simple: we propose to mimic the true flash crash of the New York Stock Exchange. So, a group of cyberterrorists, with just money and computers, following the mechanisms of the MFCA, could create an artificial but truly devastating flash crash. An quick evaluation of the legality of each step of our malicious flash crash attack shows that if the quote stuffing is considered as legal (the status of it is a little bit unclear) then the MFCA is absolutely legal. We propose also a illegal version of the MFCA. Is it possible to design a countermeasure against the MFCA ? Unfortunately, as long as HTF and quote stuffing will be legal, our scenarii are highly plausible, both the legal and the illegal version, and they are not so difficult if you have enough money, or enough cybercriminals."

This is also a problem for small-scale fisheries in Peru because of the magnitude of these fisheries and the important marine biodiversity in Peruvian waters. Here we describe how we implemented a novel approach to mitigate bycatch impacts on marine turtles in Peru. We used high-frequency (HF) two-way radio communication to exchange information with fishers. We sought data that would afford insights into fishing patterns and levels of turtle bycatch so that we could identify areas of high-density bycatch in real time and warn other fishers. In return we provided oceanographic and atmospheric information useful for the fishers. Radio communication also served as a platform to promote the use of safe handling and release techniques for incidentally caught animals. During the 24 months of the programme we communicated with over 200 vessels and with 200-1,400 fishers, who used primarily longlines, gillnets, jiggers, purse seiners and trawlers. Our findings suggest that HF radio communication is a useful tool (low cost and widely used by fishers, with extensive spatial coverage), helps build links with fishers that potentially reduces fishery impacts on marine turtles, and can also provide information on poorly documented fisheries and the relevant bycatch data associated with small-scale fishing practices. © 2012 Fauna & Flora International."

We develop this argument by highlighting two features of new assemblages that have been created in financial markets since 1999. First, these assemblages give sharp economic significance to spatial location and to physical phenomena such as the speed of light (the physics of these assemblages is Einsteinian, not Newtonian, so to speak).

Identifying and understanding the impact of algorithmic trading on financial markets has become a critical issue for market operators and regulators. We propose to characterize traders' behavior in terms of the reward functions most likely to have given rise to the observed trading actions. Our approach is to model trading decisions as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and use observations of an optimal decision policy to find the reward function. This is known as Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), and a variety of approaches for this problem are known. Our IRL-based approach to characterizing trader behavior strikes a balance between two desirable features in that it captures key empirical properties of order book dynamics and yet remains computationally tractable. Using an IRL algorithm based on linear programming, we are able to achieve more than 90% classification accuracy in distinguishing High Frequency Trading from other trading strategies in experiments on a simulated E-Mini S&P 500 futures market. The results of these empirical tests suggest that High Frequency Trading strategies can be accurately identified and profiled based on observations of individual trading actions. © 2012 IEEE."

Using the (observed) last traded prices of the assets, we develop a new approach that enables to approximate the values of the efficient prices at some random times.

The goal of the presented work is to propose adaptive negotiation strategies for trading energy in a deregulated market. In particular, we provide strategies derived from game theory, in order to optimize energy production and supply costs by means of negotiation and adaptation. The novelty lies in the adaptation of the class of minority and stochastic games to the energy trading problem in order to model the strategy of the various parties involved.

It has functioned as a conduit connecting Europe and the Middle East with South Asia and far Eastern civilizations. Therefore, the study of populations in this region is essential for a comprehensive understanding of early human dispersal on the Eurasian continent. Although Y-chromosome distributions in Central Asia have been widely surveyed, present-day Afghanistan remains poorly characterized genetically. The present study addresses this lacuna by analyzing 190 Pathan males from Afghanistan using high-resolution Y-chromosome binary markers. In addition, haplotype diversity for its most common lineages (haplogroups R1a1a-M198 and L3-M357) was estimated using a set of 15 Y-specific STR loci. The observed haplogroup distribution suggests some degree of genetic isolation of the northern population, likely due to the Hindu Kush mountain range separating it from the southern Afghans who have had greater contact with neighboring Pathans from Pakistan and migrations from the Indian subcontinent. Our study demonstrates genetic similarities between Pathans from Afghanistan and Pakistan, both of which are characterized by the predominance of haplogroup R1a1a-M198 (50%) and the sharing of the same modal haplotype. Furthermore, the high frequencies of R1a1a-M198 and the presence of G2c-M377 chromosomes in Pathans might represent phylogenetic signals from Khazars, a common link between Pathans and Ashkenazi groups, whereas the absence of E1b1b1a2-V13 lineage does not support their professed Greek ancestry. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The simulation results show that this mechanism can reproduce fat-tailed distributions of returns without ad-hoc behavioral assumptions on agents. In the simulated trade process, when the order waiting-times are exponentially distributed, trade waiting times are exponentially distributed.

Specific applications of the EMH have been straightforward and predictable: For instance, its tenets as to market processing of public information helped motivate the streamlining of procedural requirements as to corporate disclosures and, more controversially, as to private securities class action lawsuits. In state corporate law, the EMH has influenced developments as to takeovers and the corporate objective. In contrast, the EMH and related learning have failed to sufficiently inform governmental actions to address financial illiteracy. Belief in the EMH and the value of efficient markets has weakened in the face of recent market anomalies and stress. The May 2010 flash crash is not easily reconciled with the EMH, and related phenomena such as high frequency trading involve an equity market microstructure far different from the microstructure at the time the EMH emerged. Actions motivated by the global financial crisis (GFC), such as the SEC short-selling ban in September 2008, arguably suggest a greater willingness to subordinate market efficiency in favor of other governmental goals. A range of important EMH-related issues loom beyond those associated with financial illiteracy, the equity market microstructure, and governmental goals. Foremost are those relating to the informational predicate on which market efficiency rests. One key aspect of the informational predicate relates to the disclosure challenges associated with financial innovations (such as asset-backed securities) and business entities heavily involved in financial innovation activities (such as certain money center banks). The quotintermediary depiction modelquot that the SEC has always used is inadequate in financial innovation-related contexts. Another key aspect relates to the massive amounts of information that the Dodd-Frank Act requires to be provided to governmental bodies. Copyright © 2012 by Annual Reviews."

These changes occurred earlier for NASDAQ stocks (primarily between 1994 and 2004) and later for NYSE-listed stocks (mostly following Reg NMS and the 2006 introduction of the NYSE hybrid market). This paper surveys the evidence of how these changes impacted market quality and shows that overall market quality has improved significantly, including bid-ask spreads, liquidity, and transitory price impacts (measured by short-term variance ratios). The greater improvement in market quality for NYSE-listed stocks relative to NASDAQ stocks beginning in 2006 suggests causal links between the staggered market structure changes and market quality. Using proprietary data sets, provided by two exchanges, that identify the activity of high frequency trading firms, studies show these firms contributed directly to narrowing bid-ask spreads, increasing liquidity, and reducing intraday transitory pricing errors and intraday volatility.

We find that the estimate based on the EHO factorization is systematically smaller than the estimate based on the LK factorization, meaning that there is a downward bias associated with the EHO factorization. In addition, we find that boundary solutions appear with a very high frequency when the LK factorization is used.

As an empirical study, we estimate optimal weights by using a particular approach for Japanese stock data listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and then compare the forecast performance of weighted and non-weighted RV through an autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average model.

Stream processing is a paradigm well-suited for many modern data processing systems that ingest high-volume data streams from the real world, such as audio/video streaming, high-frequency trading, and security monitoring. One attractive property of stream processing is that it lends itself to parallelization on multicores, and even to distribution on clusters when extreme scale is required. Stream processing has been co-evolved by several communities, leading to diverse languages with similar core concepts. Providing a common execution environment reduces language development effort and increases portability. We designed River as a practical realization of Brooklet, a calculus for stream processing. So at another level, this paper is about a journey from theory (the calculus) to practice (the execution environment). The challenge is that, by definition, a calculus abstracts away all but the most central concepts. Hence, there are several research questions in concretizing the missing parts, not to mention a significant engineering effort in implementing them. But the effort is well worth it, because using a calculus as a foundation yields clear semantics and proven correctness results. Copyright © 2012 ACM."

The testing of the methods used in previous studies compares the expected utilities only at a specific time, usually market closing time. Empirical results from our tests provide strong evidence of the Monday effect for the 1983 to 1987 period. We also find that the Monday effect is driven by large negative returns accrued during early Monday mornings, The conventional analyses for the Monday effect, such as regression analysis and stochastic dominance, cannot provide strong evidence of the Monday effect for the same period because these testing methods do not consider the return behavior during Monday mornings."

The remaining inefficiency is usually measured as the ratio of expected P&L, derived from the price signals, to its standard deviation. Such signals are also termed alpha in market slang. Signals and their volatility depend on time in a different manner, leading to temporal diversification and rise of multi-step strategies. It is shown that the coexistence of small market inefficiencies, multi-step strategies, and market impact lead to price randomization. In other words, high-frequency strategies redefine prices in their attempt to amplify weak price signals, and make markets more effective. In this paper we identify and explore discrete and continuous strategies. We further demonstrate that strategies within the domain of weak inefficiency are stable when incorporated into regular risk-return framework. In the presence of market impact we show how an efficiency edge propagates towards smaller time scales. © Lietuvos mokslu{ogonek} akademija, 2012."

Namely, we analyze how the market reacts when the presence of hidden volume in the limit order book is revealed by the trading process. We use high-frequency book and transaction data from the Spanish Stock Exchange, including a large sample of executed HLOs. We show that just when hidden volume is detected, traders on the opposite side of the market become more aggressive, exploiting the opportunity to consume more than expected at the best quotes. However, neither illiquidity nor volatility increases in the short term. Furthermore, the detection of hidden volume has no relevant price impact. Overall, our results suggest that market participants do not attribute any relevant information content to the hidden side of liquidity. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

With the rapid increases in algorithmic or high frequency trading in which trader make trading decisions by analyzing data patterns rather than fundamental factors affecting stock prices, both technical analyses and time series analyses become more relevant. In this study the authors apply the traditional time series decomposition (TSD), Holt/Winters (H/W) models, Box-Jenkins (B/J) methodology, and neural network (NN) to 50 randomly selected stocks from September 1, 1998 to December 31, 2010 with a total of 3105 observations for each company's close stock price. This sample period covers high tech boom and bust, the historical 9/11 event, housing boom and bust, and the recent serious recession and current slow recovery. During this exceptionally uncertain period of global economic and financial crises, it is expected that stock prices are extremely difficult to predict. All three time series approaches fit the data extremely well with R2 being around 0.995. For the hold-out period or out-of-sample forecasts over 60 trading days, the forecasting errors measured in terms of mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) are lower for B/J, H/W, and normalized NN model, but forecasting errors are quite large for time series decomposition and non-normalized NN models. © Kuo-Cheng Tseng, Ojoung Kwon, Luna C.

We analyze German stocks that are traded simultaneously at both exchanges using high frequency data for XETRA, NYSE, and the foreign exchange rates. Converting Euro-prices into Dollar-prices and vice versa reveals possibilities to explore the efficiency as well as arbitrage opportunities of these two stock markets. One measure of efficiency is the phenomenon of stock price clustering, describing the tendency of prices to cluster at certain prices and avoiding others. We see the result of differing extents of clustering on both exchanges, thus violating the no-arbitrage condition. We propose a trading strategy that exploits these differences.

Simulation results show the robustness of the proposed tick-by-tick covariance estimators to time stamp rounding, and their overall performance is superior to competing covariance estimators under empirically realistic microstructure conditions. These results are confirmed in the empirical application where the economic benefits of the proposed estimators are evaluated with volatility timing strategies applied to a bivariate portfolio of S&P 500 futures and 30-year U.S. treasury bond futures. © The Author, 2012.

This approach takes advantage of boosting's feature selection capability to select an optimal combination of technical indicators and design a new set of trading rules. We tested this approach with high-frequency data of the Dow Jones EURO STOXX 50 Index Futures (FESX) and the DAX Futures (FDAX) for March 2009. Our method was implemented with different learning algorithms and outperformed a combination of the same group of technical analysis indicators using the parameters typically recommended by practitioners. We incorporated this method of model calibration in a trading agent that relies on a layered structure consisting of the machine learning algorithm described above, an online learning utility, a trading strategy, and a risk management overlay. The online learning layer combines the output of several experts and suggests a short or long position. If the expected position is positive (negative), the trading agent sends a buy (sell) limit order at prices slightly lower (higher) than the bid price at the top of the buy (sell) order book less (plus) transaction costs. If the order is not 100% filled within a fixed period (i.e. 1 minute) of being issued, the existent limit orders are cancelled, and limit orders are reissued according to the new experts' forecast. As part of its risk management capability, the trading agent eliminates any weak trading signal. The trading agent algorithm generated positive returns for the two major European index futures (FESX and FDAX) and outperformed a buy-and-hold strategy. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

Volatility is found to increase when financial centres begin trading and when trading activity in different geographical regions overlaps. This inherent intraday volatility pattern is disrupted by severe spikes immediately following macroeconomic news announcements and statements relating to the prospect of conflict in Iraq. Notably, US news causes the most violent reactions to Euro exchange rate volatility, with real output, forward looking indicators and interest rate announcements being particularly important. Interest rate announcements by the ECB, and UK real output and interest rate decisions, also cause pronounced jumps in exchange rate volatility. There is also evidence that volatility increases in the period leading up to Eurozone interest rate announcements, which may indicate information leakage.

However, it is very common to compress the data just after sensing. This approach is very popular in the field of image acquisition. We compress images registered by a camera trading off signal representation complexity. Thus some of the information is simply thrown away. Sparse signal approximations have become a new tool in signal processing with wide range of applications. Recently, many algorithms for signal reconstruction have been developed, however, all of them need many parameters to be properly set before using. Setting proper parameters is crucial for preparing a real model of the single pixel camera as well as for fast and efficient image synthesis. Because of high complexity of image recovery algorithms based on compressed sensing method, image synthesis process needs to be optimized.

Major failures in the financial markets can now occur at super-human speeds, as was witnessed in the ""Flash Crash"" of May 6 th 2010. Events such as the Flash Crash may become more commonplace in future, unless lessons are learned from other fields where complex adaptive socio-technical systems-of-systems have to be engineered for high-integrity, safety-critical applications. In this document we review the literature on failures in risky technology and high-integrity approaches to safety-critical SoS engineering. We conclude with an argument that, in the specific case of the global financial markets, there is an urgent need to develop major national strategic modeling and predictive simulation capabilities, comparable to national-scale meteorological monitoring and modeling capabilities. The intent here is not to predict the price-movements of particular financial instruments or asset classes, but rather to provide test-rigs for principled evaluation of systemic risk, estimating probability density functions over spaces of possible outcomes, and thereby identifying potentially high-consequence failure modes in the simulations, before they occur in real life, by which time it is typically too late. © 2012 Springer-Verlag."

I will be keeping a copy close to my fingertips."" -Jim O'Neill, Chairman, Goldman Sachs Asset Management. How should we evaluate the forecasting power of models? What are appropriate loss functions for major market participants? Is the exchange rate the only means of adjustment? Handbook of Exchange Rates answers these questions and many more, equipping readers with the relevant concepts and policies for working in today's international economic climate. Featuring contributions written by leading specialists from the global financial arena, this handbook provides a collection of original ideas on foreign exchange (FX) rates in four succinct sections: Overview introduces the history of the FX market and exchange rate regimes, discussing key instruments in the trading environment as well as macro and micro approaches to FX determination. Exchange Rate Models and Methods focuses on forecasting exchange rates, featuring methodological contributions on the statistical methods for evaluating forecast performance, parity relationships, fair value models, and flow-based models. FX Markets and Products outlines active currency management, currency hedging, hedge accounting; high frequency and algorithmic trading in FX; and FX strategy-based products. FX Markets and Policy explores the current policies in place in global markets and presents a framework for analyzing financial crises. Throughout the book, topics are explored in-depth alongside their founding principles. Each chapter uses real-world examples from the financial industry and concludes with a summary that outlines key points and concepts. Handbook of Exchange Rates is an essential reference for fund managers and investors as well as practitioners and researchers working in finance, banking, business, and econometrics. The book also serves as a valuable supplement for courses on economics, business, and international finance at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Inc."

We confirm earlier results that large trades, which qualify as shocks for the purpose of this analysis, are timed as they occur when liquidity in the market is extraordinarily high. Moreover, we find that adverse liquidity effects peak within the first-minute interval after a large trade. In contrast to previous researchers' results, we discover that liquidity recovers not within minutes, but within a few seconds so that the adverse effect already diminishes significantly towards the end of the first post-event minute. Three minutes later, basically no residue from the liquidity shock remains observable. We attribute this finding to the fact that temporary order-book imbalances are immediately detected by algorithmic trading engines and high-frequency traders whose order management (IT-) systems are continuously eagle-eying the stock markets for such opportunities. Interestingly, our results differ depending on the market under scrutiny."

The model was validated by satisfactory agreement of the theoretical velocity autocorrelation function with its empirical counterpart obtained for the continuous quotation. This agreement is mainly a result of a sharp backward correlation found and considered in this article. This correlation is a reminiscence of such a bid-ask bounce phenomenon where backward price jump has the same or almost the same length as preceding jump. We suggested that this correlation dominated the dynamics of the stock market with moderate liquidity.

Virtually every measurable dimension of US equity market quality has improved. Execution speeds and retail commissions have fallen. Bid-ask spreads have fallen and remain low, although they spiked upward along with volatility during the recent financial crisis. Market depth has increased. Studies of institutional transactions costs find US costs among the lowest in the world. Unlike during the Crash of 1987, the US equity market mechanism handled the increase in trading volume and volatility without disruption. However, our markets lack a market-wide risk management system that would deal with computer-generated chaos in real time, and our regulators should address this. 'Make or take' pricing, the charging of access fees to market orders that 'take' liquidity and paying rebates to limit orders that 'make' liquidity, causes distortions that should be corrected. Such charges are not reflected in the quotations used for the measurement of best execution. Direct access by nonbrokers to trading platforms requires appropriate risk management. Front running orders in correlated securities should be banned. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company and Midwest Finance Association."

Such information is vital for international investors who have different time horizons for their investment decisions and trading strategies. Design/methodology/approach – The wavelet technique used here allows the return series to be viewed at different frequency by decomposing the series into different time horizons known as time scales. The decomposed return series enable investigation of return variability at different return intervals. Findings – In an analysis at different time scales, there is no evidence to suggest that the return dynamics of developed and emerging markets are different. In both types of markets, return variance is time scale dependent, satisfying a pure power law process, and the variability in returns is more likely to be due to the dynamics at the lower time scales. While emerging markets generally exhibit a higher level of volatility, the relative contribution from each time scale is quite similar to that of the developed markets. Originality/value – The difference in the return dynamics between emerging and developed markets is observed at the lowest time scale. This is an indication that differences in the return dynamics between the two types of markets may be more likely in the short term (high frequency) rather than in the long term. A plausible reason for this is speculative trading.

Gaussian linear state-space processes have recently been proposed as a model for such spreads under the assumption that the observed process is a noisy realization of some hidden states. Real-time estimation of the unobserved spread process can reveal temporary market inefficiencies which can then be exploited to generate excess returns. We embrace the state-space framework for modeling spread processes and extend this methodology along three different directions. First, we introduce time-dependency in the model parameters, which allows for quick adaptation to changes in the data generating process. Second, we provide an on-line estimation algorithm that can be constantly run in real-time. Being computationally fast, the algorithm is particularly suitable for building aggressive trading strategies based on high-frequency data and may be used as a monitoring device for mean-reversion. Finally, our framework naturally provides informative uncertainty measures of all the estimated parameters. Experimental results based on Monte Carlo simulations and historical equity data are discussed, including a co-integration relationship involving two exchange-traded funds. © 2009 Springer-Verlag."

In algorithmic high frequency trading, for instance, stock price thresholds that are of interest to a trader change rapidly, and gains directly hinge on the reaction time to relevant fluctuations. The common solution to adapt a subscription consists of a re-subscription, where a new subscription is issued and the superseded one canceled. This is ineffective, leading to missed or duplicate events during the transition. In this paper, we introduce the concept of parametric subscriptions to support subscription adaptations. We propose novel algorithms for updating routing mechanisms effectively and efficiently in classic CPS broker overlay networks. Compared to re-subscriptions, our algorithms significantly improve the reaction time to subscription updates and can sustain higher throughput in the presence of high update rates.

One characteristic of insider trading in Hong Kong is the high frequency of transactions and the large amounts of money involved. Inside purchases appear to signal and correct undervaluation and inside sales appear to signal and correct overvaluation. In contrast to research from Britain and the United States, insider sales are more informative than purchases. On average, insiders earn HK$91,297 per trade, while outsiders who mimic insiders' transactions earn minimal returns. Many firms suffer from infrequent trading and our results are consistent with directors engaging in inside transactions so as to help create a market for the shares. In additional tests, we find that the frequency of insider trading is a function of information asymmetry. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Co. and Center for Pacific Basin Business, Economics and Finance Research."

Finding better order execution rates is an intriguing problem. For brokers trading large orders, the effect of order size and the market's trend and volatility are crucial for order scheduling. The cumulated order quantity of these institutional traders usually represents a big proportion of the daily trading volume, requiring sophisticated order splitting mechanisms to reduce market impact. This paper proposes a new framework for high frequency order execution using a novel way of momentum analysis which makes use of fuzzy logic reasoning mechanisms. The suggested order placement algorithm also considers the market's intraday volatility to minimize trading costs."

We run extensive Monte Carlo simulations to find out how rescaled range analysis (RS), multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA), detrending moving average (DMA) and generalized Hurst exponent approach (GHE) estimate Hurst exponent on independent series with different heavy tails. For this purpose, we generate independent random series from stable distribution with stability exponent α changing from 1.1 (heaviest tails) to 2 (Gaussian normal distribution) and we estimate the Hurst exponent using the different methods. RS and GHE prove to be robust to heavy tails in the underlying process. GHE provides the lowest variance and bias in comparison to the other methods regardless the presence of heavy tails in data and sample size. Utilizing this result, we apply a novel approach of the intraday time-dependent Hurst exponent and we estimate the Hurst exponent on high frequency data for each trading day separately.

Yet, even for relatively wellconstrained industrial GHGs, global emissions based on 'top-down' methods that use atmospheric measurements often agree poorly with the reported bottom-up emissions. For emissions reduction legislation to be effective, it is essential that these discrepancies be resolved. Because emissions are regulated nationally or regionally, not globally, topdown estimates must also be determined at these scales. High-frequency atmospheric GHG measurements at well-chosen station locations record 'pollution events' above the background values that result from regional emissions. By combining such measurements with inverse methods and atmospheric transport and chemistry models, it is possible to map and quantify regional emissions. Even with the sparse current network of measurement stations and current inverse-modelling techniques, it is possible to rival the accuracies of regional 'bottom-up' emission estimates for some GHGs. But meeting the verification goals of emissions reduction legislation will require major increases in the density and types of atmospheric observations, as well as expanded inversemodelling capabilities. The cost of this effort would be minor when compared with current investments in carbon-equivalent trading, and would reduce the volatility of that market and increase investment in emissions reduction. © 2011 The Royal Society."

From the analysis of a stock listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, we find that realized volatility reacts positively to the lagged average trade size. However, the realized volatility forms a negative relationship with the first few lagged number of trades. As a result, the intraday causal relationship among realized volatility, volume and the number of trades is quite different from that obtained on a daily basis.

This paper extends the previous literature in three ways. First, we decompose daily returns into three intraday sub-periods (opening, midday, and closing) in order to detect more precisely the existence of weekday effects. Second, we examine both Dow- and Nasdaq-listed stocks indexes for a much longer period (1997-2007), including 2,475 trading days with 96,525 10-minute intraday observations compared with earlier studies and find statistically significant, complex intraday and interday effects of lagged returns on contemporaneous returns which, in turn, provide evidence of weekday effects. Third, consistent with an ""intraday timing of institutional order flow"" concept, both sets of indexes behave in a similar pattern, although there are some size-related differences as Dow stocks exhibit more mean-reversion over a weekly holding period. Overall, the intraday return differences are relatively small in economic terms and thus are not likely to present viable arbitrage opportunities. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011."

We initially show that over 99% of the strains of M. bovis, the cause of bovine tuberculosis, isolated from cattle in the Republic of Ireland and the UK are closely related and are members of a single clonal complex marked by the deletion of chromosomal region RDEu1 and we named this clonal complex European 1 (Eu1). Eu1 strains were present at less than 14% of French, Portuguese and Spanish isolates of M. bovis but are rare in other mainland European countries and Iran. However, strains of the Eu1 clonal complex were found at high frequency in former trading partners of the UK (USA, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and Canada). The Americas, with the exception of Brazil, are dominated by the Eu1 clonal complex which was at high frequency in Argentina, Chile, Ecuador and Mexico as well as North America. Eu1 was rare or absent in the African countries surveyed except South Africa. A small sample of strains from Taiwan were non-Eu1 but, surprisingly, isolates from Korea and Kazakhstan were members of the Eu1 clonal complex. The simplest explanation for much of the current distribution of the Eu1 clonal complex is that it was spread in infected cattle, such as Herefords, from the UK to former trading partners, although there is evidence of secondary dispersion since. This is the first identification of a globally dispersed clonal complex M. bovis and indicates that much of the current global distribution of this important veterinary pathogen has resulted from relatively recent International trade in cattle. © 2011."

This paper highlights four properties of price-contingent trading that increase the frequency of such events. Price-contingent trading is common across financial market, since it includes algorithmic trading, technical trading, and dynamic option hedging. The four properties we consider are: (1) high kurtosis in the distribution of order sizes; (2) clustering of trades within the day; (3) clustering of trades at certain prices; and (4) feedback between trading and returns. The paper estimates the relative importance of these factors using data from the foreign exchange market. Calibrated simulations indicate that interactions among these factors are at least as important as any single one. Among individual factors, the orders' size distribution and feedback effects have the strongest influence. Overall, price-contingent trading could account for half of realized excess kurtosis. The paper suggests that extreme returns unaccompanied by news are statistically inevitable in the presence of price-contingent trading. © 2011 Elsevier B.V."

Experiments showed a strong, monotonic relationship between the coherence and a listener's ability to discriminate values of ITD. The relationship was found to be independent of other, widely varying acoustical properties of the rooms. However, the relationship varied dramatically with noise band center frequency. The ability to discriminate small ITD changes was greatest for a mid-frequency band. To achieve sensitivity comparable to mid-band, the binaural coherence had to be much larger at high frequency, where waveform ITD cues are imperceptible, and also at low frequency, where the binaural coherence in a room is necessarily large. Rivalry experiments with opposing interaural level differences (ILDs) found that the trading ratio between ITD and ILD increasingly favored the ILD as coherence decreased, suggesting that the perceptual weight of the ITD is decreased by increased reflections in rooms. © 2010 Acoustical Society of America."

However, many scenarios require continuous, online processing of data streams and events. We present ESC, a new stream computing engine. It is designed for computations with real-time demands, such as online data mining. It offers a simple programming model in which programs are specified by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). The DAG defines the data flow of a program, vertices represent operations applied to the data. The data which are streaming through the graph are expressed as key/value pairs. ESC allows programmers to focus on the problem at hand and deals with distribution and fault tolerance. Furthermore, it is able to adapt to changing computational demands. In the cloud, ESC can dynamically attach and release machines to adjust the computational capacities to the current needs. This is crucial for stream computing since the amount of data fed into the system is not under the platform's control.

For application, we focus on the problem of estimating the high-frequency beta of an asset return when the returns are subject to the effects of market microstructure. Specifically, we study the correlation between intraday log returns of two assets. Our investigation starts with the effect of non-synchronous trading on intraday log returns when the underlying return series follows a stationary time series model. This is a random aggregation problem in time series analysis. We also study the effect of non-synchronous trading on the covariance of two asset returns. To overcome the impact of non-synchronous trading, we use Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to recover the underlying log return series based on the observed intraday data. We then define a high-frequency beta based on the recovered log return series and propose an efficient method to estimate the measure. We apply the proposed analysis to many mid-or small-cap stocks using the Trade and Quote Data of the New York Stock Exchange, and discuss implications of the results obtained.

Although this formalism is quite general (and can be applied to any interhuman communication with nontrivial priority), we consider it in the context of a financial market where heterogeneous agent activities can occur within a wide spectrum of time scales. As the main general consequence, we found (by additionally using the Saddle-Point Approximation) the scaling or power-dependent form of the partition function, Z(q′). It diverges for any negative scaling powers q′ (which justifies the name anomalous) while for positive ones it shows the scaling with the general exponent τ(q′). This exponent is the nonanalytic (singular) or noninteger power of q′, which is one of the pilar of higher-order phase transitions. In definition of the partition function we used the pausing-time distribution (PTD) as the central one, which takes the form of convolution (or superstatistics used, e.g. for describing turbulence as well as the financial market). Its integral kernel is given by the stretched exponential distribution (often used in disordered systems). This kernel extends both the exponential distribution assumed in the original version of the CTRW formalism (for description of the transient photocurrent measured in amorphous glassy material) as well as the Gaussian one sometimes used in this context (e.g. for diffusion of hydrogen in amorphous metals or for aging effects in glasses). Our most important finding is the third- and higher-order phase transitions, which can be roughly interpreted as transitions between the phase where high frequency trading is most visible and the phase defined by low frequency trading. The specific order of the phase transition directly depends upon the shape exponent α $ defining the stretched exponential integral kernel. On this basis a simple practical hint for investors was formulated. © 2010 EDP Sciences, SIF, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Design/methodology/approach-The objective is achieved by an empirical examination using the high-frequency intraday data. The main methods used for the research are the autoregressive conditional duration model and the UHF-GARCH model. Findings-This paper gives an empirical study of mutual funds’ behavior on two aspects. The first aspect is the direct impact on micro variables. The results show that mutual funds changing their positions will have different influences to the spread, adding position broadens the spread, while decreasing position makes the spread narrow; behaviors of funds change the clustering characteristic of the duration. The second aspect is the impact on the relationships among micro variables. The results indicate that trading started by liquidity buyers will make volatility larger. Research limitations/implications-This paper supposes funds as informed traders and individual investors as liquidity traders in China’s stock market. If it is not true, some interpretations of empirical results would be wrong. The authors’ results may help researchers to understand the information content of funds’ trading behaviors in the microstructure aspect. Originality/value-The paper is an original work, which will be interesting to scholars in market microstructure and to practitioners in the Chinese stock market. The main contributions of the paper are: The use of high-frequency data to study funds’ behaviors and combine the trading duration and investors’ trading behavior to analyze the information content of trading behaviors; second, the use of 14 stock samples in the Shanghai Stock Exchange to do the empirical study, which ensures the reliability of the results. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

In Congressional hearings, SEC chair Mary Schapiro pointed to computerized trading as a potential driver for stock prices to drop to just one cent. Companies that use algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading strategies however argue that the core technologies are not the cause of such failures, pointing to the fact that markets have collapsed before without any assistance from computers. Software vendor Progress Software says that Flash Crash is a more of a market structure issue, but the recovery from the situation where valuable shares were offered for a penny each came equally quickly. London Stock Exchange, and regulators such as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the UK's Financial Services Agency, are aimed to use the same technology as the algorithmic traders to identify potential abuses."

Many of the characteristics of these systems, however, cannot be adequately captured by traditional financial modelling approaches. Financial systems are complex, nonlinear, dynamically changing systems in which it is often difficult to identify interdependent variables and their values. Financial brokerage is concerned with executing orders of buying and selling of certain amounts of shares at the best possible price. Many mathematical and algorithmic systems have been developed for this task, however they cannot seem to overcome a standard volume based system. This paper proposes a new framework for high frequency trading using an intelligent fuzzy logic based momentum analysis system. The system was applied to brokerage of financial stocks, and tested against the standard volume based brokerage system. The Fuzzy Logic Momentum Analysis System has proven to outperform the traditional and standard systems that are used in the industry. © 2010 IEEE."

This dataset is considered to be the biggest available high-frequency dataset dealing with the individual FX market traders' trading activities. The second step is to build agent-based models of traders. The traders are modelled to respond to physical time to account for the different market seasonalities. The key elements in modeling the traders are zero-intelligence directional-change events trading strategy, historical prices, actual FX market traders' behaviour, limit orders, FX market trading sessions and market holidays. Using the identified stylized facts of FX market trading activity, we evaluate the trading agents' collective trading behaviour. The results of this comparison indicate that the trading agents' collective trading behaviour resembles, to a certain extent, the collective trading behaviour of FX market traders. © 2011 IEEE."

Using daily ensemble averages we analyze two different measures of intraday volatility, trading frequency and the mean square fluctuation of increments for the three most active FX markets; we find that both measures indicate that the underlying stochastic dynamics exhibits nonstationary increments. We show that the two volatility measures are equivalent. In each market we find three time intervals during the day where the mean square fluctuation of increments can be fit by power law scaling in time. The scaling indices in the intervals are different, but independent of the FX market under study.

Thus if the financial instruments prices cannot be completely accurate described as random walk processes, there is place for the involvement of different systematic structured technical analysis rules. The objective of this paper is to provide a synthetic test for the partial inefficiency of the USD / CAD exchange market as is this reveal by the employment of high frequency one minute data and also to estimate the ""excess"" returns generated by an adaptive MESA Moving Average based trading strategy. The paper combines the appliance of an Brock-Dechert-Scheinkman portmanteau test in order to evaluate the time dependence in the exchange rate series with such a trading rule and concludes that markets 'informational imperfections can be exploited by the usage of technical analysis indicators especially if these indicators are constructed in an adaptive manner.

Handbook of Modeling High-Frequency Data in Finance addresses the many theoretical and practical questions raised by the nature and intrinsic properties of this data. A one-stop compilation of empirical and analytical research, this handbook explores data sampled with high-frequency finance in financial engineering, statistics, and the modern financial business arena. Every chapter uses real-world examples to present new, original, and relevant topics that relate to newly evolving discoveries in high-frequency finance, such as. Designing new methodology to discover elasticity and plasticity of price evolution. Constructing microstructure simulation models. Calculation of option prices in the presence of jumps and transaction costs. Using boosting for financial analysis and trading. The handbook motivates practitioners to apply high-frequency finance to real-world situations by including exclusive topics such as risk measurement and management, UHF data, microstructure, dynamic multi-period optimization, mortgage data models, hybrid Monte Carlo, retirement, trading systems and forecasting, pricing, and boosting. The diverse topics and viewpoints presented in each chapter ensure that readers are supplied with a wide treatment of practical methods. Handbook of Modeling High-Frequency Data in Finance is an essential reference for academics and practitioners in finance, business, and econometrics who work with high-frequency data in their everyday work.

We contribute to the literature on market microstructure and behavioral finance by providing new results on the disposition effect and on the manifestation of risk aversion on the high-frequency trading level. These novel insights are made possible by the joint characterization of not only the decision to close (exit) a position, usually considered in isolation in the literature, but also the decision to open (enter) a position, which together describe the trading process in its entirety. While the disposition effect is defined with respect to the willingness to realize profits/losses with respect to the performance of the position under consideration, we find that the performance of the total portfolio of positions is an additional factor influencing trading decisions that can reinforce or dampen the standard disposition effect. Moreover, the proposed methodology allows the investigation of the strength of these effects for different groups of investors ranging from small retail investors to professional and institutional investors. © The Author 2011.

Our empirical results, based on long samples of high-frequency equity and bond futures returns, suggest that the dynamic dependencies in the daily continuous sample path variability are well described by an approximate long-memory HARGARCH model, while the overnight returns may be modeled by an augmented GARCH type structure. The dynamic dependencies in the non-parametrically identified significant jumps appear to be well described by the combination of an ACH model for the time-varying jump intensities coupled with a relatively simple log-linear structure for the jump sizes.

Within our sample portfolios we look at the relationship between stock returns and past trading volume for these equities. This research also investigates the seasonal aspects of contrarian portfolios and observes weekly, monthly and yearly effects. We report significant contrarian profits for the period investigated (from 2001 to 2006) and show that contrarian profit is a persistent feature for the strategies examined. We also document that contrarian portfolios earn returns as high as 6.54% per day for portfolios with no short-selling restrictions, and 4.71% in the restricted model.

This suggests that the possible causative agent(s), including genetic factors such as HLA-B51, might have had spread along this route. Five cross-sectional and population-based field studies showed that the prevalence of BS was between 20 and 421 among 100,000 adolescent/adult population in Turkey. The lower two frequencies (20/105 and 80/105) come from Thrace, the European part. The disease is less common in Western Europe, USA, and in the rest of the world but perhaps not as rare as it had previously been thought. A recent study showed that BS was as frequent (7.1/105) as other vasculitic diseases-9/105 for the combination of polyarteritis nodosa, microscopic polyangiitis, Wegener's granulomatosis, and Churg-Strauss syndrome-in a suburb of Paris, France. We will review the epidemiological features of the field surveys of BS in Turkey and the rest of the globe. We also look at the regional differences of some of the clinical and laboratory features.

With VAR, Vector Error Correction and GARCH model, we found that volume and volatility of three foreign exchange rates are highest in turbulent period. The relations among three currencies are different especially for EUR/JPY from VEC model. USD based rate did not affect on EUR/JPY in turbulent period, whereas USD based rate had clear effect on EUR/JPY during benchmark period.

XCS is then adopted for knowledge rule discovery. After analyzing the property with domain-specific knowledge that the price of index futures will get close to that of spot products at the time the futures mature, four important factors related to bias, price spread, expiry date, and intraday trading timing are considered as the conditions of XCS to build the inter-market arbitrage model.

Moving beyond purely theoretical models, Stephen Taylor applies methods supported by empirical research of equity and foreign exchange markets to show how daily and more frequent asset prices, and the prices of option contracts, can be used to construct and assess predictions about future prices, their volatility, and their probability distributions. Stephen Taylor provides a comprehensive introduction to the dynamic behavior of asset prices, relying on finance theory and statistical evidence. He uses stochastic processes to define mathematical models for price dynamics, but with less mathematics than in alternative texts. The key topics covered include random walk tests, trading rules, ARCH models, stochastic volatility models, high-frequency datasets, and the information that option prices imply about volatility and distributions. Asset Price Dynamics, Volatility, and Prediction is ideal for students of economics, finance, and mathematics who are studying financial econometrics, and will enable researchers to identify and apply appropriate models and methods.

The measures-trading volume, time-to-maturity, asymmetric effect from negative shocks, and intra-week seasonality-are assessed to identify improvements in day-ahead predictions. The model where the total variation is separated into its continuous and jump components is compared with the simpler heterogeneous autoregressive model of realized variation both in- and out-of-sample. The results show a strong degree of persistence in realized volatility, and significant impacts from the mentioned market measures when predicting Nord Pool forward price volatility.

Krause, Seismic gaps and plate tectonics: seismic potential for major boundaries, Pure and Applied Geophysics 117 (1979) 10821147], there are well-defined gaps (called seismic gaps) between strong earthquakes.

Mainardi, Waiting-times and returns in high-frequency financial data: an empirical study, Physica A 314 (2002) 749755]. For the case of seismic gaps, we analytically derive an upper bound of prediction efficiency given the coefficient of variation of the distribution ξ. For the case of stock market crashes, we develop an algorithm that predicts the next crash within a certain time interval after the previous one.

SCD distribution is associated with specific geographical areas, and therefore, its introduction into Iberia may be related to the migration of different populations. We have analyzed the variation of uniparental markers in Portuguese populations with high frequency of SCD - Coruche, Pias, and Alcacer do Sal - to evaluate if their present-day pattern of neutral diversity could provide evidence about people inhabiting the area over different time periods. Two hundred and eightyfive individuals were sampled in Coruche, Pias, and Alcacer do Sal. All were analyzed for the control region of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA); males were additionally examined for Y-chromosome markers. Results were then compared with data from other Portuguese and non-Portuguese populations. In Coruche, the genetic profile was similar to the profile usually found in Portugal. In Alcacer do Sal, the frequency of sub-Saharan mtDNA L lineages was the highest ever reported (22%) in Europe. In Pias, mtDNA diversity revealed higher frequencies of Mediterranean haplogroups I, J, and T than usually found in surrounding populations. The presence of Sub-Saharan maternal lineages in Alcacer do Sal is likely associated with the influx of African slaves between the 15th and 19th centuries, whereas in Pias, the Mediterranean influence might be traced to ancient contacts with Greeks, Phoenicians, and Carthaginians, who established important trading networks in southern Iberia. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

While some of these ""stylized facts"", such as the inverse cubic law distribution of price returns indeed seem to be universal, there is less consensus about other phenomena. In particular, there has been a long-running debate in the literature about whether the distributions of trading volume VΔt and the number of trades NΔt occurring in a given time interval Δt, are universal, and whether the volume distribution is Levy-stable. In this article, we analyse data from the National Stock Exchange of India, both daily and high frequency tick-by-tick, to answer the above questions. We observe that it is difficult to fit the VΔt and NΔt distributions for all stocks using the same theoretical curve, e.g., one having a power-law form. Instead, we use the concept of the stability of a distribution under temporal aggregation of data to show that both these distributions converge towards a Gaussian when considered at a time-scale of Δt=10 days. This appears to rule out the possibility that either of these distributions could be Levy-stable and at least for the Indian market, the claim for universality of the volume distribution does not hold. © Springer-Verlag Italia 2011."

In a simulation study, evidence is found that infrequent trading induces a sizable distortion of the test statistics towards overrejection. A new empirical investigation using high frequency information of the most heavily traded electricity forward contract of the Nord Pool Energy Exchange corroborates the evidence of the simulation.

For the extended model, we present the nor- malized and un-normalized filtering equations, a robustness theorem and the consistency of Bayes estimates. Based on the robustness theorem, we employ the Markov chain approximation method to construct a robust recursive algo-rithm for computing the posteriors and Bayes estimates. We present a Monte Carlo example to demonstrate that the computed Bayes estimates converge to their true values. The algorithm is applied to one and an half month of intraday transaction prices of 5-year Treasury notes. Bayes estimates are obtained.

In the market model, heterogeneous agents trade one risky asset in exchange for cash. Agents have zero intelligence and issue random limit or market orders depending on their budget constraints. The price is cleared by means of a limit order book. The order generation is modelled with a renewal process where the distribution of waiting times between two consecutive orders is a Weibull distribution. This hypothesis is based on recent empirical investigation made on high-frequency financial data (Mainardi et al. 2000, Raberto et al. 2002, Scalas et al. 2003). We investigate how the statistical properties of prices and of waiting times between transactions are affected by the particular renewal process chosen for orders. Results point out that the mechanism of the limit order book is able to recover fat tails in the distribution of price returns without ad-hoc behavioral assumptions regarding agents; moreover, the kurtosis of the return distribution depends also on the renewal process chosen for orders. As regarding the renewal process underlying trades, in the case of exponentially distributed order waiting times, also trade waiting times are exponentially distributed. Conversely, if order waiting times follow a Weibull, the same does not hold for trade waiting times. © 2006 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

The detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) method is adopted to investigate the long-term memory of relative order prices. We further study the statistical regularities of order sizes in the opening call auction, and observe a phenomenon of number preference, known as order size clustering. The probability density function (PDF) of order sizes could be well fitted by a q-Gamma function, and the long-term memory also exists in order sizes.

In our sample, we show that a risk-averse investor who is given the option of choosing variance/covariance forecasts derived from MSE-based optimal sampling methods versus forecasts obtained from 5- and 15-minute intervals (as generally proposed in the literature) would be willing to pay up to about 80 basis points per year to achieve the level of utility that is guaranteed by optimal sampling.

The results indicate that, altogether, there is a dominant cool-off effect in play and that the latter is much stronger for the floor rather than ceiling price. This explains why we observe more hits to the ceiling rather than to the floor in our sample despite the fact it covers one of the most turbulent periods for emerging markets. We then build a trading strategy that accounts for the cool-off effect in the conditional mean so as to demonstrate that the latter has not only statistical but also economic significance.

An initial look at financial time series gives the impression that they are random in nature. If true, this would make the forecast, and therefore the trading, of such series exceptionally difficult. The efficient market hypothesis states that the current price contains all available information in the market. This leads to the predictability of most financial time series as being a rather controversial issue. Experts have been forecasting and trading financial markets for decades, using their knowledge and expertise in recognizing patterns and interpreting current financial data. This paper extends the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System to create an expert system that is capable of using fuzzy reasoning combined with the pattern recognition capability of neural networks to be used in financial forecasting and trading. The novelty of the approach lies in its application to the field of high frequency finance. Such an approach has not been used so far with high frequency trading or as a part of an automated trading strategy. This has produced an expert trading system which overcomes the physical limitations of human experts and traders in taking multiple decisions at extremely short time intervals. This means the system can perform predictions and trading decisions at a very high frequency using intra-day data. © 2009 IEEE."

We demonstrate further that the number of arbitrage opportunities has decreased in recent years, implying a corresponding increase in pricing efficiency.

With market data rates rapidly growing, the financial community is demanding solutions that are extremely fast, flexible, adaptive, and easy to manage. This paper explores multiple avenues to deal with the decoding and normalization of Option Price Reporting Authority (OPRA) stock market data feeds encoded with FIX Adapted for Streaming (FAST) representation, on commodity multicore platforms, and describes a novel solution that encodes the OPRA protocol with a high-level description language. Our algorithm achieves a processing rate of 15 million messages per second in the fastest single socket configuration on an Intel Xeon E5472, which is an order of magnitude higher than the current needs of the financial systems.

We exert financial market microstructure theory, traders' psychology and trading mechanism to explain the different intraday phenomenon between the futures market and the stock market, which has a distinctive 'U' pattern. Basing on this, by the help of Granger causality test theories and Vector Autoregressive models (VAR), we study the factors that influence the volatility of yields and the lagged orders. The results show that there are two-way Granger causality among each two of the absolute yield, volume and open interest, which is different from the empirical result of the stock market that there is a one-way Granger causality from volume to absolute yield, and the difference comes from the short mechanism of futures market. Through the decomposition of variance of VAR models and the impulse response analysis, we empirically analyze the dynamic relationship among the three factors. The conclusion shows that: when we treat the volatility of absolute yield as an explained variable, the residual disturbance can be explained about 90% by its lagged terms, and volume can explain about 10%. When volume is interpreted as an explained variable, about 80% of the residual disturbance can be explained by its lagged terms and the volatility of the absolute price explains about 20%. When open interest is considered as an explained variable, lagged terms of its own interprets about 45% to 70% of the residual disturbance, the volume explains 25%-45%, and the volatility of absolute price explains 5% to 10%. All the explanatory variables reach stable about 20-30 minutes later. Empirical result tells the weak impact from open interest to volatility of absolute yield and volume and the strong correlation between volatility of absolute yield and volume.

Using a variance ratio test, we uncover serial correlation in the first eigenmodes and find slight negative serial correlation for eigenmodes within the Wishart range. Our spectral analysis and variance ratio investigations suggest that interpolating missing data or illiquid trading days with zero-order hold introduces high frequency noise and spurious serial correlation.

In Monte Carlo simulations, we find that for plausible levels of bid-ask bounce, infrequent trading and nonsynchronous trading, the realized co-range still improves upon the realized covariance. In a volatility timing strategy for S&P500, bond and gold futures, we find that the co-range estimates are less noisy, which results in lower transaction costs and higher Sharpe ratios. © The Author 2009.

This implies that high-frequency returns series contain lots of noises. In order to overcome this problem, the Markov-switching vector autoregression model that combines a leading indicator and returns is performed in this study.

This study utilizes recent advances in econometric theory to decompose total asset price volatility into a smooth, continuous component and a discrete (jump) component. We analyze a data set that consists of high-frequency tick-by-tick data for all stocks in the S&P 100 Index, as well as similar futures contract data on three U.S. equity indexes and three U.S. Treasury securities during the period 1999-2005. We find that discrete jumps contribute between 15% and 25% of total asset risk for all equity index futures, and between 45% and 75% of total risk for Treasury bond futures. Jumps occur roughly once every five trading days for equity index futures, and slightly more frequently for Treasury bond futures. For the S&P 100 component stocks, on days when a jump occurs, the absolute jump is between 80% and 90% of the total absolute return for that day. We also demonstrate that, in the cross section of individual stocks, the average jump beta is significantly lower than the average continuous beta. Cross-correlations within the bond and stock markets are significantly higher on days when jumps occur, but stockbond correlations are relatively constant regardless of whether or not a jump occurs.

Leverage is readily accessible for the investor/hedger with margin requirements. Contrary to stocks, transaction costs are very small. Large operators are able to reduce brokerage fees and therefore incur mainly liquidity costs.

The impact of derivatives trading on the underlying stock market has been widely documented in the Finance literature. In particular, significant differences in the statistical properties of asset returns (for instance, mean and variance) during expiration and non-expiration days have been advanced as an evidence for the destabilization effect (or lack there of) of derivative instruments. The earlier studies have, however, drawn their conclusions without rigorously modelling the underlying stochastic data generation process. Given that the statistical properties mentioned before are merely traits of the asset returns, this approach can lead to spurious results if analyzed in isolation of the underlying process. We propose to address this crucial shortcoming by examining the expiration day effect from a GARCH (Generalized Auto Regressive Conditional Heteroskedastic) framework. We use both daily and high frequency (5 min and 10 min) data on S&P CNX Nifty Index. Our central finding using intra-day data is that while there is no pressure - downward or upward - on index returns, the volatility is indeed significantly affected by the expiration of contracts.

Use of high-frequency data, trading strategies and growing emphasis on the risks of extreme events makes the macrovariable procedure problematic. This article explores an alternative to the principal components analysis approach: independent components analysis (ICA). ICA seeks independence and maximizes a chosen risk parameter. We apply an ICA procedure based on a kurtosis maximization algorithm to real estate investment trust (REIT) data. The results show that ICA successfully captures kurtosis characteristics of REIT returns, offering possibilities for developing of risk management strategies that are sensitive to extreme events and tail distributions, augmenting traditional mean-variance approaches. © 2007 American Real Estate and Urban Economics Association."

The context is the UK market, after the reforms introduced in March 2001, analysed with an original set of price drivers reflecting economic, technical, strategic, risk, behavioural and market design effects. Models are estimated separately as daily time-series of the 48 half-hourly trading periods. All coefficients exhibit substantial intra-day variation, relating to the heterogeneity of operating plants and market design aspects. This reveals a market responding to economic fundamentals and plant operating properties, with learning and emergent financial characteristics, as well as some strategic manipulation of capacity, most effectively exercised by the more flexible plants. Using regime-switching parameters, the effects of capacity margin and inter-day capacity adjustment are elucidated, suggesting rent-seeking behaviour, despite the relatively low prices at the time. Overall, high-frequency, aggregate fundamental price models can usefully uncover critical aspects of market performance, evolution and agent behaviour. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

We extend their model to analyze British and Dutch stocks with ADRs, which trade on both sides of the Atlantic for one or two hours each day. We predict that, in the presence of sufficient small liquidity trading, traders concentrate their trades in the overlapping period and split orders across markets. We document considerable empirical support. In the cross-section, we find order-splitting only for ADRs with most NYSE small liquidity trading. The evidence is (i) increased volatility, increased volume, and (weakly) higher liquidity supply in the overlap and (ii) positive correlation in order imbalance across markets. We further find that the common component in order imbalance has long-term price impact, which supports the notion that these order-splitters are informed traders. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Like existing models, this model assumes that the level of arbitrage activity is positively related to the magnitude of absolute mispricing. However, unlike existing models, the new model assumes that a parameter governing a key feature of this relationship varies over time. Specifically, several versions of a smooth transition model of mispricing are introduced that each allow the shape of the transition function to be determined by a set of explanatory variables. Using high frequency data from the S&P 500 spot and futures market, the results show that the nature of the non-linearity in mispricing corresponds to arbitrageur behaviour that varies (in a periodic fashion) over the trading day. This is evinced by the superior fit of the new model of mispricing, in comparison to the results based on existing econometric models of mispricing. Finally, the observed periodicity in arbitrageur behaviour indicates that arbitrageurs prefer to trade during certain periods within the trading day - a result that contradicts the findings obtained when using existing econometric models of mispricing. © 2007 The Author Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."

BIE has been shown previously to reduce scatter and improve image signal‐to‐noise ratios without an associated loss of resolution. Methods & Materials: A mammography QA phantom (CIRS model 011A) was imaged on a prototype Siemens breast tomosynthesis system. Projection images were processed with BIE, which is an iterative, statistical processing technique that estimates and removes radiographic noise and scatter. To assess image quality, line pair and mass‐like objects were digitally embedded at varying levels of contrast. A grid search over the four free parameters of the algorithm (full‐width half‐maximum, Gibbs beta multiplier, scatter‐to‐primary ratio, and iteration number) was conducted to optimize signal‐difference‐to‐noise ratio (SdNR) of those line pairs and masses. The optimized, processed images were reconstructed using the Siemens filtered backprojection algorithm. Results: Resolution (measured by SdNR of line pairs) was consistently preserved for 1/2 and 1/4 Nyquist frequencies and/or targets with at least medium (≥3%) contrast. These correspond well to parenchyma that tends to be low‐frequency and medium‐contrast as well as calcifications which are high‐frequency and high‐contrast. For simulated masses, SdNR was consistently improved up to 4‐fold. Reconstructed images showed qualitative improvements in lesion conspicuity for masses, fibers, and calcifications. Conclusion: BIE processing demonstrated improved lesion conspicuity while maintaining resolution in tomosynthesis projection images. On‐going work will explore trading off this image quality improvement for reduced dose. Specifically, low‐dose (50% or lower) images will be processed with BIE to yield the same image quality as a regular‐dose acquisition. Low‐dose tomosynthesis is clinically significant given the likelihood of requiring two scans per breast for screening and even more scans for diagnostic exams, contrast imaging, or biopsy guidance.

The idea is simple: find two stocks that move together and take long/short positions when they diverge abnormally, hoping that the prices will converge in the future. From the academic point of view of weak market efficiency theory, pairs-trading strategy should not present positive performance, as, according to it, the actual price of a stock reflects its past trading data, including historical prices. This leaves us with a question: does pairs-trading strategy present positive performance for the Brazilian market? The main objective of this research is to verify the performance and risk of pairs-trading in the Brazilian financial market for different frequencies of the database: daily, weekly and monthly prices for the same time period. The main conclusion of this simulation is that pairs-trading strategy was a profitable and market-neutral strategy at the Brazilian market.

We find that the significant, asymmetry of return distribution and negative relationship between price change and first-order lagged trading volume, and that value at risk analysis and back testing also indicate quantile regression model is a competitive method to risk management in high-frequency data conditions. Finally the abnormality of intradaily risk pattern near opening and closing is also discovered."

This paper evaluates and compares the quality of several recently-proposed estimators in the context of a relevant economic metric, i.e., profits from option pricing and trading. Using forecasts obtained by virtue of alternative volatility estimates, agents price short-term options on the S&P 500 index before trading with each other at average prices. The agents' average profits and the Sharpe ratios of the profits constitute the criteria used to evaluate alternative volatility estimates and the corresponding forecasts. For our data, we find that estimators with superior finite sample Mean-squared-error properties generate higher average profits and higher Sharpe ratios, in general.

The empirical evidences show that as the temporary quote volatility increases, or the spread decreases, or the depth of the best quotes on the same side of the market increases, or the depth of the best quotes on the opposite side of the market decreases, the probability of less aggressive trade order categories decreases, while the probability of more aggressive trade order categories increases, i.e., the trade order aggressiveness in fact increases.

Although there is a definite autoregressive and conditional heteroscedasticity structure in electricity returns, we find that after simple filtering no pattern remains.

The phase diagram of the filtered returns provides a useful visual check on independence, a property necessary for pricing and trading derivatives and portfolio construction, as well as providing useful insights into the market dynamics. © 2009 American Institute of Physics."

The choice of optimal time grid for these calculations is not trivial and generally requires analysis of RV dependence on the grid spacing (so-called RV signature). Typical RV signatures have a maximum at the finest time grid spacing available, which is attributed to the microstructure effects. This maximum decays into a plateau at lower frequencies, which implies (almost) stationary return variance. We found that the RV signatures in the modern global FX market may have no plateau or even have a maximum at lower frequencies. Simple averaging methods used to address the microstructure effects in equities have no practical effect on the FX RV signatures. We show that local detrending of the high-frequency FX rate samples yields RV signatures with a pronounced plateau. This implies that FX rates can be described with a Brownian motion having non-stationary trend and stationary variance. We point at a role of algorithmic trading as a possible cause of micro-trends in FX rates. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

For large ocean-going ships wave-induced vibrations can, depending on trade and design, cause up to 50% of the fatigue damage. The vibrations may be due to springing and whipping effects. In this paper, we address the fatigue damage caused by wave-induced vibrations in a containership of newer design trading in the North Atlantic. The fatigue damage was obtained both experimentally and numerically. The experimental results were found from tests performed with a flexible model of the ship, while the numerical predictions were done using nonlinear hydroelastic strip theory. The measurements showed that the wave-induced vibrations contributed approximately 40% of the total fatigue damage. The numerical method predicted the wave frequency damage well, but was found to overestimate the total fatigue damage by 50%. This was mainly due to an overprediction of the wave-induced vibrations. The discrepancy is partly related to three-dimensional (3D) effects which are not included in the two-dimensional (2D) slamming calculation, and partly to an overprediction of the springing contribution. Moreover, the numerical method does not account for the steady wave due to forward speed. By using a simplified approach we show that high-frequency damage can be significantly reduced by including the steady wave for the relevant vessel, implying better agreement with the experimental results. © 2008 JASNAOE."

The second-to-fourth digit length ratio (2D:4D) has been proposed as a marker of these prenatal androgen effects, a relatively longer fourth finger indicating higher prenatal androgen exposure. 2D:4D has been shown to predict success in highly competitive sports. Yet, little is known about the effects of prenatal androgens on an economically influential class of competitive risk taking - trading in the financial world. Here, we report the findings of a study conducted in the City of London in which we sampled 2D:4D from a group of male traders engaged in what is variously called ""noise"" or ""high-frequency"" trading. We found that 2D:4D predicted the traders' long-term profitability as well as the number of years they remained in the business. 2D:4D also predicted the sensitivity of their profitability to increases both in circulating testosterone and in market volatility. Our results suggest that prenatal androgens increase risk preferences and promote more rapid visuomotor scanning and physical reflexes. The success and longevity of traders exposed to high levels of prenatal androgens further suggests that financial markets may select for biological traits rather than rational expectations. © 2009 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA."

We infer daily institutional trading behavior from the ""tape"", the Transactions and Quotes database of the New York Stock Exchange, using a sophisticated method that best predicts quarterly 13-F data from trades of different sizes. We find that daily institutional trades are highly persistent and respond positively to recent daily returns but negatively to longer-term past daily returns. Institutional trades, particularly sells, appear to generate short-term losses-possibly reflecting institutional demand for liquidity-but longer-term profits. One source of these profits is that institutions anticipate both earnings surprises and post-earnings announcement drift.

Under this approach to wealth maximization, automated trading focuses on the process determining directional trades for individual securities based upon the receipt and interpretation of new data. This paper presents a stochastic price formation algorithm that implements a cognitive decision making system modeled by twin radial basis function artificial neural networks to produce a high frequency automated trading system for individual equity securities listed on U.S. exchanges. The overall effectiveness and efficiency of the automated trading system is calibrated by estimating non-parametric quasi elasticity coefficients for individual firm fundamental characteristics. We find that automation driven by cognitive science can effectively auto-trade securities and produce changes to individual wealth that equals or exceeds the performance generated by a simple buy-and-hold strategy. We also identify four fundamental firm factors that explain the ability of the automated trading algorithm to produce a measured level of percent-positive trades. © Izmir University of Economics, Turkey, 2010."

This is motivated by the earlier finding that in the FX markets a single scaling factor might not always be sufficient across all relevant time-scales: a different region may exist for intradaily time-scales and for larger time-scales. In specific, this paper investigates (i) if different scaling regions appear in stock market as well, (ii) if the scaling factor systematically differs from the Brownian, (iii) if the scaling factor is constant in time, and (iv) if the behavior can be explained by the heterogenuity of the players in the market and/or by intraday volatility periodicity. Wavelet method is used because it delivers a multiresolution decomposition and has excellent local adaptiviness properties. As a consequence, a wavelet-based OLS method allows for consistent estimation of long-memory. Thus issues (i)-(iv) shed light on the magnitude and behavior of a long-memory parameter, as well. The data are the 5-minute volatility series of Nokia Oyj at the Helsinki Stock Exchange around the burst of the IT-bubble. Period one represents the era of ""irrational exuberance"" and another the time after it. The results show that different scaling regions (i.e. multiscaling) may appear in the stock markets and not only in the FX markets, the scaling factor and the long-memory parameter are systematically different from the Brownian and they do not have to be constant in time, and that the behavior can be explained for a significant part by an intraday volatility periodicity called the New York effect. This effect was magnified by the frenzy trading of short-term speculators in the bubble period. The found stronger long-memory is also attributable to irrational exuberance."

The realized volatility is the representative estimator of (integrated) volatility and is computed from historical data of the return. The sampling interval of the return plays a key role in computing the realized volatility. It is commonly believed in empirical finance literature that the return process should not be sampled too often in a fixed period. The realized volatility results become biased if the sampling interval is chosen to be too small although the realized volatility computed from the high frequency data should be the reliable estimate from a statistical point of view. One source of the bias is the unequally spaced time series from the non-synchronous trading. The method based on Fourier analysis proposed in Malliavin and Mancino (2002) is very effective approach since it does not require the even spaced time series. However, recent studies find that the market microstructure closely relates with the bias of volatility estimator. The microstructure issues become more pronounced when the data are sampled at finer intervals. The empirical studies suggest that the contamination due to market microstructure makes the bias in the volatility estimator. The property about the estimator based on Fourier analysis has not been examined so far when the observed sample contains market microstructure noise. This research shows that the estimator based on Fourier analysis is also biased when the observed sample contains microstructure noise and proposes the bias corrected estimation method. We compared the properties of these estimators using Monte Carlo experiments. The results summarized in Table1. In Table 1, [Y, Y]T(all), IV T(RV) and IVT(F) are the relative errors of the realized volatility, the bias corrected realized volatility proposed in Zhang et al (2004) and the bias corrected estimate proposed in this research, respectively. Figure 1 shows that the empirical distribution of the relative errors (Figure Presented) of estimates. We find that the realized volatility commonly used fails to estimate the true integrated volatility when the returns are sampled at high frequency with microstructure noise and the proposed estimator in this research has the smallest mean squared error among others. This characteristic is also found in the unevenly sampled case. (Figure Presented)."

The DSL flavor using the broadest spectrum today is known as VDSL. The reach performance of VDSL is upstream limited as the upstream bands use the highest frequencies. These high frequencies experience more channel attenuation, resulting in smaller Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) values. In this paper, a way of increasing the upstream reach performance is described. After investigating the VDSL transceiver, the reach performance of a VDSL modem is identified to be dominated by the echo power. Therefore, limiting the downstream echo yields a better upstream receive signal. This results in trading off downstream bit rate for more upstream bit rate. The way to optimally limit the echo is derived and high performance gains can be achieved. Finally, the optimal solution is approximated with a near-optimal solution with considerably less complexity. The near-optimal solution performs very well compared to the optimal solution. © 2003 IEEE."

The asset price dynamics is described by a marked point process Y, whose local characteristics (in particular the jump-intensity) depend on some unobservable hidden state variable X, The dynamics of Y and X may be strongly dependent. In particular the two processes may have common jump times, which means that the actual trading activity may affect the law of X and could be also related to the possibility of catastrophic events. The agents, in this model, are restricted to observing past asset prices. This leads to a filtering problem with marked point process observations. The conditional law of X given the past asset prices (the filter) is characterized as the unique weak solution of the Kushner-Stratonovich equation.

Different from the existing literature, the analysis relies on a pure jump process for high-frequency security prices and explicitly distinguishes among alternative sampling schemes, including calendar time sampling, business time sampling, and transaction time sampling. The main finding in this article is that transaction time sampling is generally superior to the common practice of calendar time sampling in that it leads to a lower mean squared error (MSE) of the realized variance. The benefits of sampling in transaction time are particularly pronounced when the trade intensity pattern is volatile. Based on IBM transaction data over the period 2000-2004, the empirical analysis finds an average optimal sampling frequency of about 3 minutes with a steady downward trend and significant day-to-day variation related to market liquidity and a consistent reduction in MSE of the realized variance due to sampling in transaction time that is about 5% on average but can be as high as 40% on days with irregular trading. © 2006 American Statistical Association."

It uses the event of European Monetary Union (EMU), and the upheaval that this entailed, as an opportunity to empirically investigate these relationships in the electronic inter-dealer spot FX market. The microstructure effects relate to both price and time. There are two price effects, namely price discreteness and price clustering, and two time effects, namely the time elapsed between sample periods and the time-gap between successive trades or quoted price submissions. Strong evidence emerges that all four factors are important in the determination of bid-ask spreads. This study uses a unique and rich foreign exchange (FX) dataset of global inter-dealer electronic transactions to examine microstructural effects in the spot foreign exchange market. This dataset enables us to shed new light on the debate surrounding the observations that trading volumes have fallen and bid-ask spreads have widened in inter-dealer spot FX markets following European Monetary Union (EMU). Our work provides a more detailed account of the changes that actually occurred at this time, because our data is more comprehensive than has previously been available. Our four-technical-feature explanation is in contrast to the hypothesis of market maker response to exogenous changes in volume as proposed by Hau, Killeen and Moore [Hau, H., Killeen, W., Moore, M. (2000). The euro as an international currency: Explaining puzzling first evidence. Centre for Economic Policy Research, working paper., Hau, H., Killeen, W, Moore, M. (2002). How has the euro changed the foreign exchange market? Economic Policy 17, 34, 149-191]. Price discreteness means that prices or exchange rates are not an infinite number of digits long, but rather they are truncated to a small number of digits. In the case of the FX market, exchange rates are specified to five digit accuracy. Price clustering refers to the fact that traders may not use all available exchange rates uniformly. In practice, rates ending in 0 or 5 tend to be used more than other rates. The time elapsed between the sample periods is important for a very obvious reason- price levels can differ radically if data is sampled from periods that are far apart in time. On the other hand, the time-gap between successive individual prices is also important because it allows these prices to drift apart. When the successive prices are transaction prices, this effect increases volatility. When they are successive bid and ask prices, the bid-ask spread is increased. EMU brought widespread change to financial markets. Much of this change is directly due to the re-denomination of certain instruments from Deutschemarks (DEM) to euros (EUR). Since these currency units are of different values, the nature of the price discreteness affecting instruments which are now denominated in EUR will be different from what it was under DEM denomination. This point is exemplified by our finding that the smallest sized bid-ask spread and smallest price increment for the EUR are both 74% greater than that for the DEM, after controlling for drift in currency values. Our four proposed factors are successful in explaining the observed changes in bid-ask spreads, but are less able to explain the observed changes in price volatility. Also, our results overwhelmingly accept the price resolution hypothesis explanation for price clustering behavior in the spot FX market and overwhelmingly reject the price attraction hypothesis. In the case of the EUR(DEM)/USD bid-ask spread, we provide a deeper understanding of the technical market features that caused this to increase. We show that the widening of the USD/JPY bid-ask spread seems primarily due to the inter-temporal change in currency value. We also show that the narrowing of EUR(DEM)/CHF bid-ask spreads seems largely due a near 50% decrease in the pricing increment used. We find that increased volume has reduced the time-gap for traded and quoted prices for USD/CHF. Finally, in the case of EUR(DEM)/JPY, we find that market practice caused wider bid-ask spreads. The bid-ask spread data evidence suggests that the advent of EMU seems to have strengthened the USD's position as the dominant international vehicle currency. We consider this surprising because we believe that part of the intention in launching the single currency must surely have been the opposite. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Results: A seizure frequency reduction of 20.6% was found at the end of the follow-up period. No relationship was detected between the length of the stimulation period and the reduction in the seizure frequency. 21% of the patients showed a reduction in seizure frequency of 50% or more. The seizure severity showed improvement in the first 12 months of treatment. The largest seizure reduction was found in the patients with highest frequency of background activity at the baseline EEG. Neuropsychological findings: no negative impact on behaviour, moderate improvement in function, behaviour and mood. Largest seizure reduction was found in the group with the highest baseline mental function. The scores for mental age improved independently of the seizure control. Twelve patients (63%) experienced minor side effects, which subsided after 1 month. Conclusion: (1) There was a significant reduction in seizure frequency and severity. (2) No serious side effects were recorded. (3) No negative effects on cognition or quality of life were apparent.

In a simple geometric Brownian motion model, a price volatility, a fixed interest rate and a no-arbitrage condition suffice to determine a unique risk-neutral measure. On the other hand, in our framework, we relax some of these assumptions to obtain a class of allowable risk-neutral measures. We then propose a framework for learning the appropriate risk-neural measure. Since the risk-neutral measure prices all options simultaneously, we can use all the option contracts on a particular underlying stock for learning. We demonstrate the performance of these models on historical data. In particular, we show that both learning without a no-arbitrage condition and a no-arbitrage condition without learning are worse than our framework; however the combination of learning with a no-arbitrage condition has the best result. These results indicate the potential to learn Martingale measures with a no-arbitrage condition providing just the right constraint. We also compare our approach to standard Binomial models with volatility estimates (historical volatility and GARCH volatility predictors). Finally, we illustrate the power of such a framework by developing a real time trading system based upon these pricing methods."

In this paper, we explore the forecasting value of historical volatility (extracted from daily return series), of implied volatility (extracted from option pricing data) and of realised volatility (computed as the sum of squared high frequency returns within a day). First, we consider unobserved components (UC-RV) and long memory models for realised volatility which is regarded as an accurate estimator of volatility. The predictive abilities of realised volatility models are compared with those of stochastic volatility (SV) models and generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models for daily return series. These historical volatility models are extended to include realised and implied volatility measures as explanatory variables for volatility. The main focus is on forecasting the daily variability of the Standard & Poor's 100 (S&P 100) stock index series for which trading data (tick by tick) of almost 7 years is analysed. The forecast assessment is based on the hypothesis of whether a forecast model is outperformed by alternative models. In particular, we will use superior predictive ability tests to investigate the relative forecast performances of some models. Since volatilities are not observed, realised volatility is taken as a proxy for actual volatility and is used for computing the forecast error. A stationary bootstrap procedure is required for computing the test statistic and its p-value. The empirical results show convincingly that realised volatility models produce far more accurate volatility forecasts compared to models based on daily returns. Long memory models seem to provide the most accurate forecasts. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

This resulted in a growing interest in analysis and modelling of high frequency financial time-series, in particular order and trading waiting times. Generally speaking, for constant market activity and in the absence of memory, the waiting time distribution is assumed to be exponential. Indeed, only an exponential distribution can results in a memoryless process. However, recent empirical studies have shown that the trading waiting times point process is not a Poisson process with exponential waiting-time survival function. In this paper, empirical analyses and computational experiments are presented on high-frequency data for a double-auction (book) market. Main objective of the paper is to generalize the order waiting time process in order to properly model such empirical evidences. The empirical study is performed on the best bid and best ask data of 7 U.S. financial markets, for 30-stock time series. In particular, statistical properties of trading waiting times have been analyzed and quality of fits is evaluated by suitable statistical tests, i.e., comparing empirical distributions with theoretical models. Starting from the statistical studies on real data, attention has been focused on the reproducibility of such results in an artificial market. The computational experiments have been performed within the Genoa Artificial Stock Market. In the market model, heterogeneous agents trade one risky asset in exchange for cash. Agents have zero intelligence and issue random limit or market orders depending on their budget constraints. The price is cleared by means of a limit order book. The order generation is modelled with a renewal process. Based on empirical trading estimation, the distribution of waiting times between two consecutive orders is modelled by a mixture of exponential processes. Results show that the empirical waiting-time distribution can be considered as a generalization of a Poisson process. Moreover, the renewal process can approximate real data and implementation on the artificial stocks market can reproduce the trading activity in a realistic way."

For example in monitoring and examining Internet traffic; analysing high-frequency financial data in market trading; voice and video capture; data logging in numerous areas of scientific enquiry. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods revolutionised statistical analysis in the 1990s by providing practical, computationally-feasible access to the flexible and coherent framework of Bayesian inference. However, massive datasets have produced difficulties for these methods since, with a few simple exceptions, MCMC implementations require a complete scan of what might be several gigabytes of data at each iteration of the algorithm. For time-series data, progress is possible using modern sequential Monte Carlo methods (known as particle filters). With suitable modifications the techniques can be adapted to deal with more general data catalogues. Copyright © 2006 by Imperial College Press."

When assessing how informative order flow is, the VAR methodology is typically employed, using impulse response functions. However, in such analyses, the direction of causality runs explicitly from order flow to asset return. If data are sampled at anything other than at the highest frequencies then any feedback trading may well appear contemporaneous; trading in period t depends on the asset return in that interval. The implications of contemporaneous feedback trading are examined in the spot USD/EUR currency market and we find that when data are sampled at the 1 and 5 minute frequencies, such trading strategies cause the price impact of order flow to be significantly larger than when feedback trading is ruled out.

However, one has noticed asymmetries in the duration and amplitude of the cycles as well as in the intensity of the impact of shocks on commodity price volatility. This bears implications for the analysis of producer support strategies. After reviewing some explanations of these irregularities, particularly those concerning the price and the main producer country of cocoa, five GARCH specifications are applied to high-frequency data of the cocoa price, relative to a fifteen-year period. A moderate level of persistence is observed in the conditional mean of weekly observations. As for the conditional variance, specification tests and forecasting capacity measures give preference to models with a Student-t distribution, with daily data being also characterised by right-ward-skewness and relatively higher, even if time-varying, volatility persistence. Finally, estimates of two of these models are used to analyse space-time relationships among price disparity across different trading centres, inter-regional producer price dispersion in Côte d'Ivoire, and unforeseen volatility. In the appendix, properties of alternative GARCH models are compared, and a new specification is proposed."

Using transaction data of the stocks that have both options and futures contacts from 1993 to 1997, we find that options expiration has significant effects on return and volatility of the underlying stocks in absence of individual stock futures. After introduction of a cash-settled stock futures contract, the effects decrease notably. However, the switch of a futures contract from cash settlement to physical delivery promotes the expiration effects on return and volatility and boosts temporary price changes on expiration days. Finally, options expiration has little effect on trading volume. Trading activity tends to behave normally regardless whether stock futures contracts are available or not. © 2005 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois. All rights reserved."
