Abstract
"we address the stock predictability puzzle, a challenge in the stock market often discussed in behavioral finance. our approach formulates a statistical model within rational finance, avoiding reliance on behavioral finance assumptions, and integrates stock return predictability into the black–scholes option pricing framework. empirical analysis focuses on the predictability of stock prices by option and spot traders, introducing a forward-looking measure we term “implied excess predictability.” results show that option traders' predictability of stock returns positively correlates with moneyness, whereas for spot traders, this relationship is inverse. these findings suggest a potential asymmetry in stock price predictability between spot and option traders. additionally, we demonstrate the importance of incorporating stock return predictability into option pricing formulas, particularly for options with strike prices significantly different from the stock price. conversely, when moneyness is close to unity, predictability is not integrated into option pricing, indicating equal information among spot and option traders. comparison of volatility measures reveals the difference between implied and realized variances or variance risk premia as potential predictors of stock returns. © 2024 university of new orleans."
"this study examines the effects of religiosity and islamic financial literacy on muslims’ financial behavior and well-being. additionally, it investigates the impact of sociodemographic variables on the centrality of religiosity, financial literacy, financial management behavior, and the well-being of muslim consumers. this research integrates perspectives from rational choice theory, the rational choice theory of religion, and behavioral finance to illuminate the mechanisms behind these relationships. data were collected through a non-probability sampling method from 1141 muslim individuals aged between 18 and 65 living in indonesia. the results indicate that the centrality of religion in the lives of muslim consumers and islamic financial literacy significantly affects their financial management behavior and financial well-being. however, the empirical evidence suggests a more substantial effect of islamic financial literacy than religiosity on both dependent variables. © the author(s) 2024."
"when the environmental performance is below the aspiration, will firms make substantive changes? in order to answer this question, based on the behavioral theory of the firm, this paper examines the impact of negative environmental performance feedback on substantive green innovation (gi) and its influencing mechanism. it is found that the negative environmental performance feedback induces substantive gi, which is positively moderated by external regulations (i.e., government environmental regulation and public environmental concern) and internal incentive (i.e., executive equity incentive). media pressure and risk preference act as mediators in the above promotion effect. heterogeneity analysis shows that the above promotion effect as well as the moderating effects of external regulations are more pronounced in private firms, while the moderating effect of internal incentive is more pronounced in state-owned firms. furthermore, the above promotion and moderating effects are more pronounced after the esg rating event of syntao green finance agency. this paper offers new sights into understanding the motives of substantive gi and policy suggestion for promoting firms to achieve sustainable development. © 2024 erp environment and john wiley & sons ltd."
"the decision to participate in a follow-on investment round is fundamental for venture capitalists, as it determines the extent of financial and non-financial resources they will provide to the portfolio company going forward. in this context, we analyze the effect of sunk costs, i.e., the invested capital and monitoring efforts expended, on the likelihood of subsequent funding. based on a dataset of 30,602 investment decisions about us-based portfolio companies from 2009 to 2019, we find that both the amount of capital previously invested and the intensity of monitoring significantly increase the probability of continued investment, underscoring the sunk cost fallacy's role in venture capital. additionally, we investigate the moderating effects of fund maturity, represented by dry powder and fund age, on these relationships. the results highlight the intricate balance between investment biases and fund-level considerations in venture capital decisions, contributing to the behavioral finance literature. © 2024 the authors"
"objective: the authors reviewed the literature on finance-based interventions used to improve clinical and psychosocial outcomes among adults experiencing mental disorders, substance use disorders, or both. methods: a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature, published from 1900 to 2022, was conducted. only studies with participants with a mental disorder or a substance use disorder, a structured finance-based intervention or program, a quantitative dependent variable in a behavioral health outcomes domain, and a defined research design were included. studies were rated with a quality assessment tool, and overall evidence (levels i-vii) for the outcomes was rated. results: in total, 544 articles were identified, screened for eligibility, and reduced to 55 articles. these articles were rated by two independent raters, and 18 articles were ultimately included. of these 18 articles, four reported findings of randomized controlled trials (rcts), one conducted a secondary analysis of an rct, and the remaining articles were observational studies. the most studied intervention was representative payeeship, which reduced substance use and enhanced money management, showing the strongest evidence for improving outcomes among adults with behavioral health conditions. weaker evidence suggested that financial education and assistance interventions could improve health care utilization and other psychosocial outcomes among individuals with mental or substance use disorders. conclusions: level ii-v evidence indicates that finance-based interventions can improve outcomes among adults experiencing behavioral health conditions. further research is needed to assess the impact of interventions beyond representative payee programs on objectively measured outcomes."
"we leverage a national panel of us municipalities to show that behavioral finance helps explain the number of months of expenses that municipalities save in cash and investment reserves. we hypothesize that municipal managers may be using numerical anchoring based on historical values to target the number of months of savings to hold and that they may also be engaged in social learning to target months of savings based on the behavior of neighboring municipalities. we test for these effects by combining two innovative techniques, a two-stage regression designed to test for anchoring of present financial values based on theoretically unimportant historical values, and a measure of the spatial autocorrelation of savings to test for social learning. the results suggest that, in deciding how much to save, municipal managers are influenced by the levels of savings they held in the past and the savings levels of their neighbors, and that they underreact to changes in theoretically relevant economic fundamentals. further tests also suggest that the smallest cities by population are more influenced by the behavior of their neighbors than their past savings, whereas the largest cities show the opposite result, effectively choosing themselves as their own role models. © 2024 wiley periodicals llc."
"the world is turning towards renewable energies to sustainably meet its increasing demand for energy. naturally, this is being accompanied by a strong momentum in trading within the renewable energy market. today, behavioral finance acknowledges the major role of wider psychological and social factors in shaping the stock market, through influencing investors' sentiment. therefore, this paper explores the understudied question of whether environmental television newscasts can be used as a proxy for measuring investors' sentiment and in helping to improve the forecast accuracy of renewable energy stock prices. first, we compute the sentiment scores of the environmental newscasts of cnn, bbc news, msnbc, and fox news. we then use machine learning to implement a baseline forecast model, as well as an augmented one which takes the newscasts’ sentiment scores as input. using four different accuracy metrics, we find that environmental tv newscasts can improve the forecast accuracy of renewable energy stock prices in 78 % of the experiments, and decrease the mean absolute error, mean squared error, and root mean squared error in 83.3 % of the experiments. we also find that the sentiments of conservative news outlets, such as fox news, can improve the forecast accuracy of renewable energy stock prices more than liberal ones. finally, we provide some insights into potential psychological dynamics that can help us make sense of the results, such as the negativity bias theory. © 2024 the author"
"the outbreak of uncertain events, e.g., financial crisis, regional conflict and abrupt contagion, has a significant impact on residents’ income. hence, the wealth management and portfolio selection become more and more important. in addition, the behavioral finance believes that decision-making process of the investors not only depend on utility maximization, but also on who to compare with. it differs from the traditional finance based on rational cognitive acquiring and decision-making of agents, in this paper, we consider both investment uncertainty and investment utility with reference level for portfolio selection. first, we introduce the uncertainty theory and loss aversion utility with reference level based on behavioral finance. then we study an uncertain multi-period portfolio selection problem. moreover, we formulate an uncertain behavioral portfolio selection model with three objective functions for which we propose an equivalent program consisting of a main model and two auxiliary models for tri-objective optimization model. thereafter, we use a modified evolutionary root system growth algorithm to solve the transformed models. finally, a numerical simulation allows to show the practicability of proposed models and validity of modified algorithm. © 2024 elsevier b.v."
"background: medicaid is a key policy lever for expanding access to mental health services and supports for children in schools, especially low-income and minority children. this study examines how medicaid finances mental health promotion and prevention (tier 1), screening and selected interventions (tier 2), and treatment (tier 3) in schools, informing policy recommendations to expand school mental health. methods: seventeen key informant interviews were conducted virtually from march to october 2022 with research, practice, and policy leaders in school mental health and medicaid. interview transcripts were thematically coded to inform recommendations. results: interview themes included that medicaid is a key funder of mental health services, primarily in tier 3, and that braiding and blending funds is necessary to support services across all tiers in schools. interviewees underscored the need to expand tier 2 in schools, to expand and diversify the behavioral health workforce (including via non-licensed providers, aligning school-employed provider licensure and billing requirements and building school-community referral relationships), strengthen teaming structures (including state children's cabinets, student case management, and education/medicaid agency coordination), and leverage technical assistance and training to speed up adoption of new policies (including via guidance and templates that facilitate billing for school health services). conclusions: policymakers, practitioners, and advocates can use these findings to identify policies and strategies to expand school mental health and reduce inequities. © 2024, american school health association."
"this study conducts a comprehensive knowledge mapping and scientometric analysis of behavioral finance research from 1990 to december 2022. by retrieving 2056 articles from web of science and utilizing citespace for visualization, we aim to understand intellectual structures, emerging trends, research hotspots, and future trajectories in bf. the findings reveal a substantial increase in research output, with the university of california and harvard university emerging as the most prolific institutions. seven main research areas, including bf, risk, prospect theory, and return, were identified. a network analysis of 742 authors demonstrates collaborative dynamics, particularly intensified during crises such as the covid-19 pandemic and the russian invasion of ukraine. the study's originality lies in its temporal and dynamic analysis, providing valuable insights through co-citation and co-occurrence network analyses. © 2024 elsevier b.v."
"this study investigates the predictive power of sentiment metrics concerning the volatility of tourism-related stocks listed on the pakistan stock exchange (psx) during recent crises. we employed univariate and multivariate garch-family econometric models to analyze daily data collected from march 2020 to april 2023. the data is categorized into two periods: a (covid-19 until february 2022) and b (the vote of no-confidence motion until april 2023). the findings indicate that market sentiment (ms) plays a more significant role than individual sentiment in predicting stock price volatility and negatively impacts return volatility. during period a, the fear index (fi) and in b, economic policy uncertainty (epu) were identified as factors contributing to increased fluctuation in tourism-related stocks. additionally, ms exhibited a heightened level of bearishness compared to the covid-19 era. the multivariate bekk-garch analysis revealed that ms past volatility negatively spillover onto the current conditional volatility of psx firms. this highlights the paramount importance of ms in understanding stock price fluctuations in the psx. interestingly, the technology sector exhibited lower sensitivity across the analysis. this study provides valuable insights for decision-makers by elucidating the principles of behavioral finance theory within the context of the psx. they should prioritize long-term strategies to institutionalize investors, enhance their emotional intelligence, and mitigate psychological biases in the market. © the author(s) 2024."
"we propose to implement the tvp-var-sv model and the spillover index approach to investigate the dynamics of mutual influences between market volatility and risk aversion sentiment (represented by variance risk premium), from aspects of realized variance (rv) and implied variance (iv). we innovatively study the evolution of volatility information transmission mechanisms by analyzing time-varying impulse response and dynamic connectedness in the chinese market. upon inspecting shock effects from investor sentiment to rv and iv, we discover that investor sentiment can cause sudden shocks on realized volatility but produce expansive shocks on expected volatility. as we compare spillover effects in call and put options, we find that (i) sentiments in put option contain more volatility information and can affect market volatility, while sentiments in call option primarily perceive volatility spillovers from market volatility, and (ii) investor sentiments in call (put) option become to present more volatility information in a bullish (bearish) market. our study provides valuable insights on behavioral finance theory and portfolio risk management. © 2024 elsevier inc."
"health and environmental issues have become pressing global problems that affect human society's sustainable development. residents are not only practitioners but also direct beneficiaries of ecological protection and play a crucial role in maintaining ecological and environmental health. health, as the basis of residents' behavioral choices, influences residents' behavior toward ecological and environmental protection. this study aims to investigate how health factors profoundly affect residents' willingness to pay (wtp) for environmental protection and reveal the intrinsic connection between health and environmental protection behavior. the 2017 china household finance survey (chfs) data and the ordered probit model were used to determine that improving residents' health greatly increases their willingness to protect the environment and passes a number of tough tests. in addition, the promotion effect of health on residents' wtp for ecological protection is markedly heterogeneous, especially in younger residents who do not have children. therefore, we suggest to policymakers and national governments a range of countermeasures and suggestions to enhance health education, safeguard public health, and promote ecological protection education. © 2024 elsevier b.v."
"existing studies on the impact of social media on the information efficiency of capital markets have opposing views. one often-overlooked aspect in these studies is the role of investor interaction, a core feature of social media. to address this gap, we employ social network analysis (sna) to investigate how investor interactions on eastmoney, china's largest online stock forum, influence capital market efficiency. our findings indicate that online investor communication can effectively disseminate firm-specific information through social networks when investor interactions are at a moderate level. however, beyond a certain threshold, heightened interactions contribute to market noise, thereby distorting the stock price discovery process. our mechanistic analysis reveals that increased investor interactions stimulate irrational emotions at both market and stock levels, ultimately impairing capital market efficiency. this study contributes to social network analysis and behavioral finance by illuminating the impact of online social interactions among retail investors on capital market information efficiency. © 2024 elsevier b.v."
"various factor models extended by jensen’s (j financ 23:389–416, 1968) alpha have been used to measure the retail investors’ portfolio (under-) performance compared to the market portfolio. the previous studies tried to explain this anomaly in behavioral finance by examining retail investors’ cognitive biases that induce irrational trading behavior. while operationalizing these cognitive biases in trading is not trivial, researchers still have found measures to proxy for biases and prove their statistical and economic significance. however, these studies only focused on linking one or a subset of behavioral biases and their effect on portfolio performance. in addition, different measures of biases across studies complicate the comparability of results. therefore, this paper provides a structured overview of the current state of the literature regarding behavioral biases and their measurements to design a behavioral factor model that should help to explain the performance alpha from a behavioral finance perspective. the paper presents an overview of 11 behavioral bias factors and 29 corresponding measurements to consider inputting in such a model. with an application-oriented focus, it is recommended to include the most researched bias factors in a factor model, which are also the most detrimental to portfolio performance, as well as to include the most frequently used and least complex measures, which results in the primary inclusion of the following eight behavioral bias factors: disposition effect, under-diversification, home bias, local bias, lottery stock preference, trend chasing, overtrading, and trade clustering. © the author(s) 2024."
"research based on investor sentiment in social media has been a hot topic of research in behavioral finance, and the reliability of investor sentiment mined from social media is a potential condition for the reliability of the results of these studies. in the past, scholars have often focused on using more reliable tools to track investor sentiment in order to get more reliable investor sentiment. however, less attention has been paid to another key factor affecting the reliability of investor sentiment on social media: the selection and collection of data. in this study, we systematically investigate the process of data selection and collection in relation to the construction of investor sentiment on social media. our findings suggest that the process of creating a dataset from social media is a process that starts and ends with a research question. in this process, we need to overcome various obstacles to end up with an imperfect dataset. the researchers must take a series of steps to get close to the best dataset and acknowledge some of the shortcomings and limitations. we emphasize that the absence of accepted, reliable standards makes it particularly important to follow basic principles. this study is an important reference for social media-based behavioral finance research. © the author(s) 2024."
"this study aimed to connect the behavioral corporate finance perspective (micro level) with complexity theory via agent-based modeling to analyze the impact of selected psychological factors of chief executive officers (ceos) on stock market volatility (macro level). specifically, we wanted to explore whether polish ceos’ subjective well-being (swb) influenced their managerial decisions during the covid-19 pandemic and how it might be related to the volatility of stock prices during this critical period in poland. our study was based on a survey of polish ceos who managed companies listed on the warsaw stock exchange. in particular, 255 ceos completed the satisfaction with life scale, the positive and negative affect scale, and a business survey on the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on company management. using the results of this survey, we built an agent-based model to investigate how ceos’ decision-making, stemming from their swb levels, influences the perception of prices by individual traders and, in turn, how it is translated into aggregate stock market volatility. the results indicate the pathways through which the microscopic-level swb of ceos influences market price formation at a macroscopic level. the findings obtained from our model may shed new light on the rational expectations theory applied to stock market volatility during the financial crisis. © the author(s) 2024."
"this study investigates the determinants of gender disparities in financial inclusion in pakistan using global findex 2021 survey data. we aim to quantify gender gaps in financial access and use, and to analyze the socio-economic factors influencing these disparities. grounded in sen’s capability approach and behavioral economics, we employ logistic regression to examine how gender influences the ownership and usage of financial products. our results reveal significant gender gaps: only 13% of pakistani women have financial accounts compared to 34% of men, with similar disparities in digital finance. socio-economic variables like education, income, and employment are found to influence financial inclusion differently for men and women. while generally supportive of financial inclusion, these factors have a weaker effect for women, suggesting deeper societal barriers. this study adds to the global financial inclusion discourse by providing a comprehensive analysis of gender disparities in pakistan. our findings highlight the need for gender-sensitive policies that address these disparities to achieve sustainable development goals related to gender equality and economic empowerment. © the author(s) 2024."
"social media-based investor sentiment proxies provide a brand new solution to recognize and measure investor sentiment. aggregating individual social media text sentiments into public sentiments through a specific aggregation method is a necessary part of constructing an investor sentiment index for social media. the choice or design of the aggregation method directly affects whether or not the researcher can capture the sentiment of the market. this study provides the first systematic review of mainstream methods for aggregating investor sentiment from social media. in addition, we systematically discuss some of the key issues of historical researchers in aggregating investor sentiment, such as neutral sentiment text, simple aggregation of directly aggregated text, etc. the findings suggest that the aggregation method used by researchers directly affects the reliability of investor sentiment indices. therefore, scholars should carefully choose sentiment aggregation algorithms based on the combination of datasets and sentiment tracking tools and articulate their rationale. this study provides important references for behavioral finance, social media mining, and microinvestor sentiment metrics. © the author(s) 2024."

"in order to balance the interests of land finance participants and maintain the stability of their capital chain, this paper combines the two levels of local government debt financing and real estate development, incorporates local governments, real estate developers, urban residents and commercial banks into a unified analytical framework, systematically constructs a behavioral game evolution model of the four core participants to analyze the stability of the equilibrium points and the system stability strategies. meanwhile, the numerical simulation is used to explore the impact of parameter changes on the behavioral game evolution trend and risk profile of each participant. the results show that: (1) the land transfer revenue and other costs of investing in local development have greater impacts on the strategic choices of local governments than the cost of land-transferring, and excessively low land transfer revenue and high costs of investing in local development will trigger a series of financial risks, which is not conducive to the systemic stability. (2) the rise in commercial banks' lending rate will increase the difficulty of real estate developers' capital turnover, so that they have to bear the risks of loan default, delay in construction and so on, however, improving the autonomous repayment rate of real estate developers can alleviate it. (3) the cost of house purchase and the benefits from quality resources acquired by urban residents from purchasing a house have different degrees of influence on the strategic choices of urban residents and work in opposite directions, so the relationship between the two factors should be adequately balanced to help urban residents avoid risks such as increased pressure in life. (4) the probability of commercial banks choosing the “lending to real estate developers” strategy is positively correlated with real estate developers' autonomous repayment rate and commercial banks' lending rate, and the inappropriate value of the two may lead to credit risk. finally, from the perspective of the game participants, targeted risk decision-making and policy recommendations are put forward. © 2024 elsevier ltd"
"purpose: we explore how sustainable management education (sme) can help prepare future leaders to manage crises effectively. precisely, the intricacies of articulating moral and economic imperatives for businesses in a manner that engages students in sustainable behavior are a serious challenge for sme. we study how to integrate reminders of moral and economic imperatives in a socially responsible investment (sri) stock-picking simulation created for sme. design/methodology/approach: adopting an experimental design, we analyzed how the reminders affected the average environment social governance (esg) integration in the portfolios of 127 graduate students in finance over a twelve-week period. findings: our results show how essential it is to balance the two imperatives. the highest level of sustainable investment is attained when utilizing both reminders. practical implications: our findings have practical implications for implementing and organizing sme in business schools to educate responsible leaders who are able to effectively manage crises. learning responsible management is most effective when students are exposed to the inherent tension between moral and economic imperatives. hence, our findings corroborate the win-win conception of sme. originality/value: no management decision study has experimentally measured the effects of sme practices on students' actual behavior. our research fills this gap by complementing previous studies on the effectiveness of teaching practices, first by drawing on behavioral sciences and measuring changes in students' actual sustainability behavior and second by introducing moral and economic imperatives into an innovative teaching resource (tr) dedicated to sme. © 2024, emerald publishing limited."
"objectives: to explore the feasibility of deploying robot-led activities for people with dementia living in aged care facilities. design: embedded mixed-methods design. setting and participants: eleven residents (aged ≥65 years) with mild to moderate cognitive impairment were recruited from 2 aged care facilities in brisbane, australia. methods: we implemented a novel control logic, “adam program,” for a human-like robot to provide proactive robot activities for people with dementia. participants individually participated in a nonfacilitated robot intervention thrice a week for 5 weeks from november to december 2022. we video-recorded each intervention session and quantified participants’ visual, behavioral, and verbal engagement. a semi-structured interview was conducted at the end of the 5-week intervention. the treatment fidelity strategies and finances were reported and evaluated. the bowen feasibility framework guided data analysis into 6 focus areas: acceptability, demand, implementation, efficacy, integration, and practicality. results: based on participants’ perceptions, findings demonstrated adequate acceptability and demand for robot-led activities. findings reported a high level of visual engagement (98.54%) and an increased trend of behavior engagement over 5 weeks. participants independently communicated with adam, with most (97.02%) verbal engagements free of human facilitation. the treatment fidelity strategies regarding the activity delivery, intervention received, and intervention skills are provided alongside the equipment expenses, revealing the feasibility of integrating robot-led activities for people with dementia in aged care facilities. conclusions and implications: using human-like robots to independently lead interactive activities for people with dementia at aged care facilities is feasible and acceptable. although robot-led activities require further improvement, this study explored a practical-driven solution that provided guidelines for developing and implementing robot-led activities in aged care settings. future studies could replicate similar robot-led activities for further investigation and evaluation. strategies for multilevel determinants of adam's implementation based on a context assessment are recommended for future research. © 2024 amda – the society for post-acute and long-term care medicine"

"purpose: this paper aims to explore the development of investment decision tools by understanding the rationality behind the disposition effect. we suspect that not all disposition decisions are irrational. the decisions should be evaluated based on the bounded rationality of the individuals’ target and tolerance level, which is not covered in previous literature. adding the context of individual preference (target and tolerance) in their decision could improve the classic measurement of disposition effect. design/methodology/approach: the laboratory web experiment is prepared to collect the responses in holding and selling the stocks within 14 days. two groups of gen z investors are observed. the control group makes a decision based on their judgment without any system recommendation. in contrast, the second group gets help inputting their target and tolerance. furthermore, the framing effect is also applied as a reminder of their target and tolerance to induce more holding decisions on gain but selling on loss. findings: the framing effect is adequate to mitigate the disposition effect but only at the early day of observation. bounded rationality explains the rationality of liquidating the gain because the participants have reached their goal. the framing effect is not moderated by days to affect the disposition effect; over time, the disposition effect tends to be higher. a new measurement of the disposition effect in the context of bounded rationality is better than the original disposition effect coefficient. practical implications: gen z investors need a system aid to help their investment decisions set their target and tolerance to mitigate the disposition effect. investment firms can make a premium feature based on real-time market data for investors to manage their assets rationally in the long run. bounded rationality theory offers more flexibility in understanding the gap between profit maximization and irrational decisions in behavioral finance. the government can use this finding to develop a suitable policy and ecosystem to help beginner investors understand investment risk and manage their assets based on subjective risk tolerance. originality/value: the classic proportion gain realized (pgr) and proportion loss realized (plr) measurements cannot accommodate several contexts of users’ targets and tolerance in their choices, which we argue need to be re-evaluated with bounded rationality. therefore, this article proposed new measurements that account for the users’ target and tolerance level to evaluate the rationality of their decision. © 2024, emerald publishing limited."

"this study analyzes the intricate dynamics of cross-border interfirm interactions in the working capital financing of small and medium-sized enterprises (smes) by using a novel cyber-behavioral signaling perspective. it emphasizes the pivotal role played by the generation and transmission of credible signals to mitigate informational disparities inherent in sme finance. while extant literature predominantly focuses on physical-centric signal types, our work sheds light on smes’ strategic use of behavioral factors in the network ecology to generate and transmit signals. grounded in signaling theory and informed by network ecology, we propose that network ecology constitutes a fertile environment for smes to effectively communicate their creditworthiness through high-quality signals. using survey data from 276 chinese smes, our empirical analysis reveals that cross-border interfirm effects—both unintentional network spillover and intentional network transitivity—significantly bolster sme financing outcomes. leveraging digital knowledge repositories mediates the strength and effectiveness of these signals, and exerts an even stronger positive impact on sme working capital financing in the absence of well-established normative mechanisms in the wider business ecosystem. by integrating a cyber-behavioral dimension into signaling theory within the sme financing domain, this research offers new understanding on how smes can harness the untapped power of their interconnected relationships to secure external capital. the study contributes to theory and practice by elucidating pathways for smes to navigate complex interfirm linkages to facilitate improved access to working capital. © 2024 elsevier b.v."
"information ignorance refers to the act of deliberately avoiding, neglecting, or distorting information to uphold a positive self-image and protect our identity-based beliefs. we apply this framework to household finance and develop a concise 12-item questionnaire measuring individuals’ receptiveness to financial information, or the lack thereof – the financial homo ignorans (fhi) scale. we conduct two studies with samples from the general population in sweden (total n=2508) and show that the fhi scale has high reliability and distinct from other commonly used individual-difference measures in behavioral finance. we show that individual heterogeneity as assessed by the fhi scale explains a substantial variation in financial behaviors and financial well-being, also when controlling for demographics and financial literacy. these results unequivocally demonstrate the utility of the fhi scale as a valuable instrument for researchers and practitioners in comprehending and addressing the challenges posed by the omnipresence of financial information in today's world. © 2024 the authors"

"introduction: prenatal negative life events (nles) have been linked to adverse health outcomes in children. however, few studies examine this relationship during late childhood using trajectory analyses. additionally, the impact of specific nles domains on child development remains unclear. this study aims to longitudinally explore the association between nles (cumulative score and specific nles domains) and child outcomes from birth to late childhood. methods: 1135 mother-child pairs from the french eden cohort were followed from 24 to 28 weeks of pregnancy up to 11 years of age. maternal self-reports of prenatal nles were collected immediately after birth, then analyzed as a cumulative score and by nles domain. children's emotional and behavioral symptoms were assessed at 4 timepoints through the strengths and difficulties questionnaire. results: children of mothers exposed to ≥3 nles were more likely to follow trajectories of high levels of peer relationship problems (aor [95 % ci] = 5.69 [1.74–18.69]), emotional symptoms (aor [95 % ci] = 3.05 [1.08–8.63]), and conduct problems (aor [95 %] = 3.53 [1.20–10.42]). among the domains of nles, only events related to housing, finance, and living conditions were significantly associated with high emotional and behavioral difficulties trajectories (aor [95%ci] = 2.71[1.26–5.81]). limitations: potential attrition bias due to a higher dropout rate for children experiencing early indications of emotional and behavioral difficulties. conclusion: findings support the relationship between prenatal nles and child outcomes, underscoring the importance of assessing prenatal stressors across life domains to identify mothers who might be in need of support. © 2024 the authors"
"tax evasion has profound implications for both efficiency and equity, which are fundamental concerns in economics. recent estimates of the average annual tax gaps in developed countries indicate that tax evasion is ubiquitous. however, most standard models in taxation assume full enforcement and compliance, raising concerns that the conclusions and policy recommendations derived from these models may not be accurate or applicable. this chapter delves into the relationship between tax evasion, enforcement, and the informal economy by critiquing the limitations of the canonical model of tax evasion and underscoring the significance of information reporting and behavioral public finance. although the primary focus is on individuals and income taxation, the chapter also addresses value added tax (vat) and firm tax evasion in relevant sections. the first part introduces the canonical model of tax evasion (allingham and sandmo, 1972) and discusses its implications. existing models suggest a negative correlation between tax evasion and the penalty rate, the fine, and, surprisingly, the marginal tax rate. conversely, a taxpayer's tax evasion tends to increase with their income. the following section draws attention to common and distinct elements of tax evasion and the informal economy. it analyzes a simple model of labor choice considering tax evasion and the informal sector. the subsequent section emphasizes the importance of information reporting and the bidirectional flow of information between taxpayers and the government. in the final part, the chapter discusses a behavioral economics approach to tax evasion. despite the tax gap being substantial, it is still lower than what the standard theory suggests. while the tax evasion literature does not unanimously attribute this discrepancy between theory and empirical evidence to behavioral effects versus the potential lack of information reporting technologies, numerous papers in the behavioral tax evasion literature propose that many taxpayers may not base their decisions solely on maximizing potential monetary benefits. the chapter concludes by summarizing the main findings and potential policy implications derived from the literature, along with possible strategies to enhance compliance. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, ceyhun elgin. all rights reserved."
"in the realm of investment decisions, the influence of behavioral biases has emerged as a captivating area of exploration. this article embarks on a comprehensive journey through the landscape of behavioral biases in investment choices, delving into their profound impact on financial markets. contrary to traditional finance theories assuming rationality, a multitude of empirical evidence attests to the pervasive effects of cognitive and emotional biases. through an extensive literature review, this article elucidates the intricacies of key biases such as overconfidence, loss aversion, anchoring, confirmation bias, herding behavior, disposition effect, framing effects, and regret aversion. by examining the distinct ways these biases distort investors' judgment and decision-making processes, we unveil the often unexpected deviations from rationality. each bias, rooted in human psychology, can lead to suboptimal investment behaviors, portfolio misalignments, and heightened market volatility. however, recognizing the impact of these biases provides opportunities for transformative insights. as investment professionals, policymakers, and individuals alike comprehend the subtle nuances of behavioral biases, tailored interventions, educational initiatives, and adaptive strategies can be devised to mitigate their adverse effects. this article not only synthesizes the prevailing research but also charts a course for future investigations. the implications of understanding and addressing behavioral biases extend beyond financial realms, offering a bridge between finance and psychology. as interdisciplinary collaboration gains momentum, pathways for future research become evident, beckoning scholars to delve deeper into the uncharted territories of human behavior and its intricate relationship with investment decisions. through the exploration of these biases and their potential remedies, this article illuminates the evolving landscape of investment decision-making in a world where cognitive fallacies intersect with financial choicest. © 2024, university of zagreb, faculty of organization and informatics. all rights reserved."

"portfolio optimization involves finding the ideal combination of securities and shares to reduce risk and increase profit in an investment. to assess the impact of risk in portfolio optimization, we utilize a significant volatility risk measure series. behavioral finance biases play a critical role in portfolio optimization and the efficient allocation of stocks. regret, within the realm of behavioral finance, is the feeling of remorse that causes hesitation in making significant decisions and avoiding actions that could lead to poor investment choices. this behavior often leads investors to hold onto losing investments for extended periods, refusing to acknowledge mistakes and accept losses. ironically, by evading regret, investors may miss out on potential opportunities. in this paper, our purpose is to compare investment scenarios in the decision-making process and calculate the amount of regret obtained in each scenario. to accomplish this, we consider volatility risk metrics and utilize stochastic optimization to identify the most suitable scenario that not only maximizes yield in the investment portfolio and minimizes risk, but also minimizes resulting regret. to convert each multiobjective model into a single objective, we employ the augmented epsilon constraint (aec) method to establish the pareto efficiency frontier. as a means of validating the solution of this method, we analyze data spanning 20, 50, and 100 weeks from 150 selected stocks in the new york market based on fundamental analysis. the results show that the selection of the mad risk measure in the time horizon of 100 weeks with a regret rate of 0.104 is the most appropriate research scenario. this article recommended that investors diversify their portfolios by investing in a variety of assets. this can help reduce risk and increase overall returns and improve financial literacy among investors. © 2024 larni-fooeik et al. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the originalauthor and source are credited."
"do more intelligent investors take better economic decisions than less intelligent ones? is risk attitude, in particular risk/loss aversion, linked to cognitive ability? does an investor's cognitive ability impact his/her patience? is financial performance positively linked to investor's intelligence? these research questions have become highly relevant with the development of behavioral economics and behavioral finance, following the recognition that humans are not homo economicus. this paper reviews the several strands of literature devoted to answering the above questions. we first discuss the barely debated definitions and measures of intelligence/cognitive ability used in psychology, economics, and finance. we then review the results related to the (controversial) link between risk aversion and cognitive ability. we observe that the literature provides clear results for patience; individuals with a higher level of cognitive ability being more patient on average. finally, we review the contributions linking (successfully or not) portfolio choice and financial performance to cognitive ability. © 2023 john wiley & sons ltd."

"research question/issue: we examine chief executive officers' (ceos) lifetime work experience in private firms and its potential influence in shaping managers' style in public firms and their corporate policies and thus the market's perception of a firm's risk. research findings/insights: we find that the idiosyncratic risk of public firms increases with the extent of ceo work experience in privately owned firms (ceo private experience). while there is no evidence of higher investment risk taking by private ceos, the proportion of private-firm work experience has a positive association with disclosure deficiency, decrease in manager-owner agency conflicts, and an increase in political risk revelations at earnings conference calls, which, in turn, are associated with the elevation of idiosyncratic risk. theoretical/academic implications: the findings of this study underscore arguments in the upper echelons theory, imprinting theory, and behavioral agency theory. the study also has implications for literature related to corporate disclosure, governance, and political risk. practitioner/policy implications: idiosyncratic risk is important for firms, as the literature suggests it hurts a firm's ability to finance future capital investments; therefore, it is optimal for corporate boards to have strategies in place to monitor and offer orientation packages targeted at alleviating ceo style heterogeneities presented by their prior work experience in private firms. © 2023 john wiley & sons ltd."
"purpose: the study explored various dimensions of overconfidence bias (ob) among retail investors in indian financial markets. further, these dimensions were validated through formative assessments for ob. design/methodology/approach: the study applied exploratory factor analysis (efa) to 764 respondents to explore dimensions of ob. these were validated with formative assessments on 489 respondents by the partial least square path modeling (pls-pm) approach in smartpls 4.0 software. findings: the major findings of efa explored four dimensions for ob, i.e. accuracy, perceived control, positive illusions and past investment success. the formative assessments revealed that positive illusions followed by past investment success among retail investors played an instrumental role in orchestrating the obs that affect investment decisions in financial markets. practical implications: the formative index of ob has several practical implications for registered financial and investment advisors, bank advisors, business media companies and portfolio managers, besides individual investors in the domain of behavioral finance. originality/value: this research provides a novel approach to provide a formative index of ob with four dimensions. this formative index can acts as an overview for upcoming researchers to investigate the ob of retail individual investors. highlights: overconfidence bias is an important predictor of retail investors' behavior formative dimensions of the overconfidence bias index. accuracy, perceived control, positive illusions and past investment success are important dimensions of overconfidence bias. modern portfolio theory and illusion of control theory support this study. © 2023, emerald publishing limited."

"intertemporal choice refers to the decision-making process involving trade-offs between rewards available at different points in time (such as choosing between smaller immediate rewards versus larger rewards later on). empirical evidence often deviates from the exponential preferences predicted by the normative model. a hyperbolic discount function better mirrors individual behavior, explaining temporal inconsistency – whereby preferences vary over time by applying a higher discount in the present. hyperbolic preferences are associated with addictive behaviors, such as smoking and alcohol consumption, as well as depression or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. established measures in the literature quantify the extent of deviation from exponential trend exhibited by hyperbolic preferences. in addition to behavioral and cognitive factors, it is essential to incorporate financial literacy into the examination of individual decision-making behaviors. the present study analyzes the relationship between the degree of decision-making inconsistency and the degree of financial literacy inconsistency across three dimensions: knowledge, behavior, and attitudes. it aims to illustrate while financial literacy is important, it is not sufficient to ensure rational choices. rather, it reveals a strong correlation among its dimensions. the results of this research could be included when creating investor profiles required by mifid, considering insights from behavioral finance studies in these profiles. what is more, understanding psychological biases that can influence financial decision-making empowers investors to make more informed decisions and avoid common pitfalls. © 2024"

"artificial intelligence (ai) is a branch of computer science in which systems are created with intelligence that enables them to perform cognitive functions, such as perception, reasoning, learning, and decision-making. ai has formidable problem-solving abilities in various domains, such as surveillance, health care, and finance. however, its societal applications raise ethical issues, such as gender and racial discrimination. moreover, psychological research on ai ethics has revealed that people react less morally to unethical decisions made by ai than to those made by humans, showing deficiencies in moral evaluations, punishments, and behavioral responses to ai. these moral deficits of ai decisions have serious negative impacts on individuals, organizations, and society. for example, research has confirmed that this effect leads companies to use ai in their recruitment processes to discriminate against job applicants, reduces people’s awareness of unethical behavior, enables companies to evade accountability, exacerbates the challenges of advocacy and justice for affected groups, and even undermines societal moral standards along with the widespread use of ai. these negative impacts will damage trust in justice and fairness, causing lasting harm to societal ethics. how can we explain ai moral deficit effects? we draw on the mind perception theory, which suggests that people’s moral reactions depend on how they perceive the mental attributes of an entity. these attributes can be divided into two dimensions: agency and experience. agency refers to the belief that the entity can act, plan, self-regulate, remember, communicate, and think like a typical adult human. experience refers to the belief that the entity can feel emotional states, such as hunger, fear, and pain. mind perception is the process of attributing mental capabilities to an entity, while moral judgment is the process of evaluating the entity as good or bad. entities with high agency are held responsible for their moral actions, and entities with high experience are expected to behave safely and ethically. people tend to view ai as having less agency and experience than adults do, which leads to the ai moral deficit effect. we explore the psychological reasons behind people’s lack of moral concern about immoral decisions made by ai. we contrast people’s moral responses to ai and human decision-makers and the serious social implications of this difference. based on the theory of mind perception and moral dualism and supported by empirical evidence, we claim that two parallel factors underlie the moral deficit effect of ai decision-making: agency and experience. additionally, we show that anthropomorphism and expectation violation can influence this effect. thus, we propose a theoretical model of the inherent psychological mechanism of the moral deficit effect of ai decision-making from the perspective of a moral agent. this model extends the theory of mind perception and deepens the understanding of moral dualism. in sum, we investigate how people react differently to biased ai and biased humans. unlike other disciplines (e.g., computer science, philosophy, law, sociology) that focus on the design of fair algorithms in their “algorithmic ethics” research, we examine the human side of the problem. we contend that comprehending these differences is crucial for tackling the social challenges of biased ai and proposing a novel approach to building fair algorithms, as well as a fresh outlook on “algorithmic ethics,” which shifts the attention from algorithmic design to human responses. this approach is vital for ethics and for ai researchers to devise ethical frameworks and guidelines for ai systems. furthermore, the findings can guide policy-making, legal frameworks and social interventions to reduce the adverse effects of ai and foster social equity and justice. however, due to the dynamic and fast-changing nature of ai, this field still needs additional research on the underlying mechanisms and intervention strategies involved. © 2024 chinese academy of sciences. all rights reserved."

"waste management is a critical public service provided by municipalities around the world. it is often problematic, inefficient, and abysmally performed in developing countries. among the problems associated with waste management in these global locations is the issue of finance. finance is required for both capital investment and operational costs. methods of waste management financing differ from place to place due to cultural, political, and socio-economic peculiarities. understanding these conditionalities is necessary to be able to proffer sustainable solutions. despite these facts, there is limited comprehensive and relevant academic literature on waste management financing mechanisms in developing countries both in the past and recent times. this work addresses a significant gap in the literature by studying the mechanism for waste management financing in developing countries using anambra state, nigeria, as a case study. the current study further investigated the associated challenges and opportunities and made critical discussions on the implications on the circular economy. user fees and subsidies from the government are the major financing sources. the absence of cost-revenue model analysis, economic and institutional volatility, the unwillingness of the service users to pay fees, and lack of transparency are major challenges to the financial sustainability of waste management in the studied context. the creation of incentives for behavioral changes, adoption of neo-liberal policies, and formal integration of informal waste pickers are factors that can minimize the cost of waste management services while promoting a circular economy. © the author(s), under exclusive licence to springer-verlag gmbh germany, part of springer nature 2024."
"among the most vulnerable groups in society is the elderly, who face issues such as a deteriorating feeling of self-worth brought on by physical weakness, a dwindling social position, and limited financial resources. feelings of insignificance have been exacerbated by the fact that families are finding it more difficult to care for the elderly due to socioeconomic and demographic changes. as a result, psychological difficulties frequently outweigh outward indications of aging as people age. with a specific focus on 260 senior individuals in punjab between the ages of 60and90, this study sought to investigate the effects of family and social attitudes toward the old. the majority of respondents claimed financial independence, but only 11% reported having stable finances due to rental income and savings account interest. but 8% struggled to pay for everyday needs, and some experienced severe financial difficulties related to fundamental needs and family responsibilities. remarkably, only 11.7% of older people consistently created strong social relationships, compared to 76.6% who did so on occasion. furthermore, 16.7% of respondents admitted to their situation, suggesting a greater dedication to maintaining family togetherness. the behavioral changes aligned with the perceptions of 83% of senior respondents who observed a shift in the way older persons view their basic obligations. family dynamics, economic dependence, physical abuse cases, feelings of isolation, inadequate social support, family members’ disdain, and food-related issues were among the main concerns. the study emphasized the complex relationships that exist between aging, health problems, decreased physical activity, and elder abuse. it also clarified the critical roles that qualities, social interactions, financial dependence, and behaviors have in influencing these relationships. © 2024, econjournals. all rights reseved."
"householders are increasingly responsible for managing residual flood risk at property level. yet, consumers are observed to adopt irrational behaviors under scenarios of risk, often making suboptimal decisions. therefore, the question is raised, if householders are required to manage flood risk at household level, how can this be made fair and efficient? policy instruments often incorporate “fairness” by subsidizing the costs of mitigation options, assuming a linear relationship between available finances and the uptake of risk mitigation measures. to integrate behavior into the assessment of policy instruments, this article develops a method to compare the uptake of flood mitigation between agents following models of expected monetary value (emv) and prospect theory (pt). an agent-based model is created, offering the option to apply either emv or pt frameworks. emv represents a rational gamble, determining whether an agent “should” invest in insurance or property-level protection. on the other hand, the pt option incorporates behavioral aspects to examine how agents are likely to respond to investment decisions in flood risk environments. the models are applied to flood re, a policy aimed at ensuring affordable insurance access for all individuals in flood risk areas. the results demonstrate that pt models exhibit greater similarity to observed behavior compared to models based on emv. these findings emphasize the importance of accommodating “irrational” behaviors within the design of policy instruments, promoting fairness and efficiency. overall, this research provides insights into the integration of behavior in policy assessments and highlights the benefits of considering pt frameworks alongside traditional rational models. by understanding and accounting for human behavior in decision-making processes, policymakers can design more effective and equitable policy instruments for managing flood risk. © 2023 the authors. risk analysis published by wiley periodicals llc on behalf of society for risk analysis."
"behavioral finance has emerged as a new branch of finance and psychology that focuses primarily on understanding the behavioral factors that play an important role in shaping a person’s thinking. behavioral finance is an extension of behavioral economics from the study of economics regarding individual decisions behavioral economics studies the behavior of an individual in the context of individual investment decisions. initially, this paper collected primary data on variables such are overconfidence, representativeness, availability, anchoring and herding biases and their impacts on investment decisions in various stock markets with the help of a systematic literature review that essentially consists of empirical studies that show that various behavioral biases have a positive impact on individual investment decisions. this study investigated the various stock markets perspectives on the impact of various oraah practices such as overconfidence, representativeness, availability, anchoring, and herding biases and their impacts on investment decisions in various stock markets. the findings of the study indicate that oraah practices are important for various stakeholders in stock markets if managed successfully which will assist in achieving substantial return upon their investment in the stock market. investors should consider the various prevalent behavior biases to achieve the long-term strategic goals of their investment. the results further indicate that the impacts of various investor investment behavioral biases and their impacts on decision making are same among various stock markets anxin securities co. ltd, shanxi securities co. ltd., haitong securities co. ltd, and china galaxy securities co. ltd. © the author(s) 2024.; the study aims to examine the impact of various behavioral biases such are overconfidence, representativeness, availability, anchoring and herding, and their effects on individual investment decisions in the case-developed country context of china. to achieve this, data was meticulously gathered from 362 participants active in the shanghai stock market. employing advanced analytical tools, particularly the smart pls 3.3.2 software and structural equation modelling (sem), this study rigorously scrutinized the intricate relationships between behavioral biases and investment decisions. the findings of this study notably reveal that all examined behavioral biases exert a significant positive impact on investment decisions within the anxin, haitong, shanxi, and china galaxy stock markets. remarkably, no substantial disparities in the effects of these biases on stock market trading were observed among these markets. importantly, these findings bear exceptional significance within the context of a developed country like china. the implications extend to a wide spectrum of stakeholders, including government entities, regulatory bodies, practitioners, the academic community, industry professionals, and researchers. regulatory authorities can leverage these insights to refine their strategies, practitioners can fine-tune their investment advisory approaches, and academia and researchers can build upon these findings to deepen the understanding of behavioral finance in the realm of stock market investments. © the author(s) 2024."
"investors and professional money managers typically categorize assets into different styles to facilitate portfolio management and capital allocations. as these market participants move funds among assets of different styles based on their relative performance, correlated trading generates return co-movement and style momentum. this chapter reviews existing theories on style investing and important findings. in particular, it presents new evidence in a large bond market and demonstrates that behavioral finance theory can help explain return co-movement and momentum in the bond market traditionally dominated by institutional and long-term investors who are thought to be less behaviorally biased. © 2024 world scientific publishing company. all rights reserved."
"this paper tests the profitability of the factor momentum strategy in the chinese market, and gives a reasonable explanation for the source of excess returns of the factor momentum strategy. it is found that the factor momentum strategy can obtain significant excess returns in the a-share market, and the bull side contributes most of the returns of the strategy. after considering the control of multiple cross-sectional indicators, different economic states, and the use of different factor numbers as a factor sample, the return of factor momentum strategy is still significant. from the perspective of behavioral finance, this paper further finds that the lower investor sentiment, the higher the return of factor momentum strategy. in extreme market conditions, the return of factor momentum strategy is higher than that of stable market. this paper provides strong evidence for the feasibility of chinese institutional investors’ market timing based on factor momentum, and has some inspiration to enrich the value investment strategies of institutional investors. © 2024 science china press. all rights reserved."
"media information plays an essential role in the stock market. recent financial research has verified that media information could shock stock price by influencing investors' expectation. now, a new type of interactive media, called digital interactive media (dim), is popular in chinese stock market and becomes the main channel for investors to understand listed companies. unlike general news media or investor forums, dim enables direct interaction between listed companies and investors. in the modern society where digital economy is booming, media information would largely affect investors' decisions. therefore, it is urgent to use natural language processing (nlp) technology to deconstruct the massive questions and answers (q&a) interactive information in dim and extract valuable factors that affect stock prices and stock performances to explore the influence mechanism of digital interactive information on stock performances. this paper firstly uses web crawling technology to obtain approximately 110000 q&a text information from the digital interactive platform ('panoramic network') from 2015 to 2021. then we use big data text analysis technology and emotional quantification technology to extract valuable influencing factors from the massive text. a multiple linear regression (mlr) model was created to explore specific influence mechanism of digital interactive information on stock price performance. the empirical results show that the emotions implicit in investors' questions do not significantly impact stock performance. however, the emotions and attitudes of the answers by listed companies can significantly affect corresponding stock prices, which indirectly confirms the proximate cause effect of behavioral finance. this effect is particularly evident in the stock prices on the current trading day and the next trading day. in the robustness test, this paper replaces dependent variable and adds relevant control variables, and the conclusion remains valid. in the endogeneity test, this paper selects sample data before the launch of panorama network in 2014 as a comparison, and uses a difference-in-difference (did) model to prove the significant impact of the launch of panorama network on chinese stock market. in the heterogeneity test, the paper classifies the market value, region, and industry of listed companies and regressed the sub samples, once again confirming the reliability of the empirical conclusions. the results of robustness test, endogeneity test, and heterogeneity test conducted in this paper all support empirical conclusions.  © 2024 huang et al. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited."

"this paper discusses some of the important insights from behavioral finance for international monetary and financial analysis. a broad approach to behavioral finance is advocated which includes analysis of the effects of uncertainty, perverse incentives, and complexity economics as well as the cognitive biases focused on in the initial contributions to behavioral finance. it offers reasons why capital mobility is often not perfect and expectations are sometimes not rational. correctly interpreted it is not a wholesale attack on efficient market theory but rather argues that markets can behave differently at different times, being efficient sometimes and subject to destabilize or insufficiently stabilizing speculation at others and focuses on the conditions that make different types of behavior more likely. it helps provide insights into issues such as currency crisis, the effects of official intervention in foreign exchange markets, the international monetary trilemma, capital flow surges and reversals, the discipline effects of fixed exchange rates and international financial markets and why uncovered interest rate parity often does not hold. this paper is dedicated to the memories of my coauthors and friends richard sweeney and clas wihlborg who were closely associated with this journal. it is based on a talk given to the claremont institute for economic policy research's research workshop in international money and finance. i appreciate valuable suggestions from the members of the workshop, especially graham bird, levan efremidze, ozan sula, and horst brezinski, ken reinhert, kishen rajan, konrad sobanski, and ed tower, and debra claypool and dan zhang for research assistance. © 2024 sciendo. all rights reserved."
"purpose: the purpose of this study is to critically examine a prevalent online scam mechanism, with the aim of understanding its exploitation of behavioral finance principles and group dynamics and propose effective countermeasures. design/methodology/approach: this study uses a blend of case study and thematic analysis, drawing from behavioral finance, social psychology and criminology, using primary source testimonies of victims to provide a detailed exploration of the scam’s operations. findings: this research uncovers the strategic use of four key principles: loss aversion, overconfidence, scarcity bias and social proof, within the scam operation. these tendencies are manipulated to induce victims to progressively invest into the fraudulent scheme, even amid growing suspicions. research limitations/implications: while the research elucidates on the workings of one specific online scam, it is necessary to explore if and how these principles are used in various other online fraudulent schemes, to develop comprehensive countermeasures. practical implications: the findings underscore the urgent need for enhanced public awareness, stronger corporate responsibility and robust regulatory oversight. there is a call for concerted efforts encompassing public education campaigns, fortified security protocols and strong legal frameworks for preventing such scams. social implications: the research emphasizes the need for collective action in ensuring a safe online space. this involves the individual user’s prudence, businesses’ proactive education initiatives and stringent legal actions against fraudulent activities. originality/value: this research offers novel insights into the nuanced manipulation of behavioral finance principles within online scams, based on empirical data from victim testimonials. these findings contribute to the understanding of the psychological mechanisms at play in online scams and are instrumental in formulating effective preventive strategies. © 2023, emerald publishing limited."
"purpose: although the value effect is comprehensively investigated in developed markets, the number of studies examining the vietnamese stock market is limited. hence, the first aim of this research is to provide empirical evidence regarding returns on value and growth stocks in vietnam. the second aim is to explain abnormal returns on vietnamese growth and value stocks using both risk-based and behavioral points of view. design/methodology/approach: from the risk-based explanation, the capital asset pricing model (capm), fama–french three- and five-factor models are estimated. from the behavioral explanation, to construct the mispricing factor, this paper relies on the method of rhodes-kropf et al. (2005), one of the most popular mispricing estimations in the financial literature with numerous citations (jaffe et al., 2020). findings: while the capm and fama–french multifactor models cannot capture returns on growth and value stocks, a three-factor model with the mispricing factor has done an excellent job in explaining their returns. three out of four fama–french mimic factors do not contain additional information on expected returns. their risk premiums are also statistically insignificant according to the fama–macbeth second-stage regression. by contrast, both robustness tests prove the explanatory power of a three-factor model with mispricing. taken together, mispricing plays an essential role in explaining returns on vietnamese growth and value stocks, consistent with the behavioral point of view. originality/value: there are several value-enhancing aspects in the field of market finance. first, this paper contributes to the literature of value effect in emerging markets. while the evidence of value effect is obvious in numerous developed as well as international markets, both growth and value effects are discovered in vietnam. second, the explanatory power of fama–french multifactor models is evaluated in the vietnamese context. finally, to the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first paper that incorporates the mispricing estimation of rhodes-kropf et al.

"this article provides a systematic review of the theoretical and empirical academic literature on the development and extension of the log-periodic power law singularity (lppls) model, which is also known as the johansen–ledoit–sornette (jls) model or log-periodic power law (lppl) model. developed at the interface of financial economics, behavioral finance and statistical physics, the lppls model provides a flexible and quantitative framework for detecting financial bubbles and crashes by capturing two salient empirical characteristics of price trajectories in speculative bubble regimes: the faster-than-exponential growth of price leading to unsustainable growth ending with a finite crash-time and the accelerating log-periodic oscillations. we also demonstrate the lppls model by detecting the recent bubble status of the s&p 500 index between april 2020 and december 2022, during which the s&p 500 index reaches its all-time peak at the end of 2021. we find that the strong corrections of the s&p 500 index starting from january 2022 stem from the increasingly systemic instability of the stock market itself, while the well-known external shocks, such as the decades-high inflation, aggressive monetary policy tightening by the federal reserve, and the impact of the russia/ukraine war, may serve as sparks. this article is categorized under: applications of computational statistics > computational finance algorithms and computational methods > computational complexity statistical models > nonlinear models. © 2024 wiley periodicals llc."
"after modern portfolio theory and the markowitz model, which considered risk and risk aversion in order to optimize investment portfolios and caused a great revolution in the field of economics, now behavioral finance topics such as ambiguity and ambiguity aversion have also been considered. given the positive results achieved by machine learning algorithms, deep learning, and time series in predicting stock returns, this article used three methods that performed better than in most studies in the field of stock return prediction. long short-term memory models are used in deep learning, random forests in machine learning, and autoregressive integrated moving average (arima) models in time series. this article compares forecasting models in order to determine which model is more accurate and then predicts the returns based on that model. this article combines their predictive results with risk and ambiguity metrics in order to develop optimization models. an evaluation was conducted based on historical data for the six-year period from 2017 to 2022 for the top five industries in the iranian stock market. according to the experiments, the deep learning model performed better than other models when it came to long-term predictions. hence, this article presents a model for optimizing stock portfolios by integrating investor unknowns with forecasting models for the first time. © 2024 with intelligence llc."
"the study's purpose is to examine the effect of herding, loss aversion, overconfidence, and fear of missing out (fomo) biases on crypto investors’ investment decisions. the study also looks at how fomo plays a mediating role between herding, loss aversion, overconfidence, and crypto investment decisions. to acquire data from crypto retail investors, the study used a questionnaire survey. a total of 473 responses were gathered and analyzed with smartpls. to achieve the study's aims, factor analysis and partial least square structural equation modelling were used. the study's findings found that fomo, herding, loss aversion, and overconfidence biases have a substantial effect on the investment decisions of crypto investors, in respective order. in addition, fomo bias establishes a complementary partial mediation on the relationship between herding, loss aversion, and crypto investors’ decision-making behavior. ergo, the present study assisted individual and institutional cryptocurrency investors, crypto portfolio managers, policymakers, researchers, and market regulators in broadening their knowledge base about cryptocurrency and forecasting investors' behavior. hence, this study contributes to the field of behavioral finance. © the author(s), under exclusive licence to springer nature b.v. 2023."

"in the ever-evolving realm of finance, investors have a myriad of strategies at their disposal to effectively and cleverly allocate their wealth in the expansive financial market. among these strategies, portfolio optimization emerges as a prominent approach used by individuals seeking to mitigate the inherent risks that accompany investments. portfolio optimization entails the selection of the optimal combination of securities and their proportions to achieve lower risk and higher return. to delve deeper into the decision-making process of investors and assess the impact of psychology on their choices, behavioral finance biases can be introduced into the portfolio optimization model. one such bias is regret, which refers to the feeling of remorse that can induce hesitation in making significant decisions and avoiding actions that may lead to unfavorable investment outcomes. it is not uncommon for investors to hold onto losing investments for extended periods, reluctant to acknowledge mistakes and accept losses due to this behavioral tendency. interestingly, in their quest to sidestep regret, investors may inadvertently overlook potential opportunities. this research article aims to undertake an in-depth examination of 41 publications from the past two decades, providing a comprehensive review of the models and applications proposed for the regret approach in portfolio optimization. the study categorizes these methods into accurate and approximate models, scrutinizing their respective timeframes and exploring additional constraints that are considered. utilizing this article will provide investors with insights into the latest research advancements in the realm of regret, familiarize them with influential authors in the field, and offer a glimpse into the future direction of this area of study. the extensive review findings indicate a growth in the adoption of the regret approach in the past few years and its advancements in portfolio optimization.  © iran university of science and technology 2024."
"purpose: following behavioral finance and monetary wisdom, the authors theorize: decision-makers (investors) adopt deep-rooted personal values (the love-of-money attitudes/avaricious financial aspirations) as a lens to frame critical concerns (short-term and long-term investment decisions) in the immediate-proximal (current income) and distal-omnibus (future inheritance) contexts to maximize expected utility and ultimate serenity across context, people and time. design/methodology/approach: the authors collected data from 277 active equity traders (professional money managers and individual investors) in pakistan’s two most robust investment hubs—karachi and lahore. the authors measured their love-of-money attitude (avaricious monetary aspirations), short-term and long-term investment decisions and demographic variables and collected data during pakistan's bear markets (pakistan stock exchange, psx-100). findings: investors’ love of money relates to short-term and long-term decisions. however, these relationships are significant for money managers but non-significant for individual investors. further, investors’ current income moderates this relationship for short-term investment decisions but not long-term decisions. the intensity of the aspirations-to-short-term investment relationship is much higher for investors with low-income levels than those with average and high-income levels. future inheritance moderates the relationships between aspirations and short-term and long-term decisions. regardless of their love-of-money orientations, investors with future inheritance have higher magnitudes of short-term and long-term investments than those without future inheritance. the intensity of the aspirations-to-investments relationship is more potent for investors without future inheritance than those with inheritance. investors with low avaricious monetary aspirations and without inheritance expectations show the lowest short-term and long-term investment decisions. investors' current income and future inheritance moderate the relationships between their love of money attitude and short-term and long-term decisions differently in pakistan's bear markets. practical implications: the authors help investors make financial decisions and help financial institutions, asset management companies, brokerage houses and investment banks identify marketing strategies and investor segmentation and provide individualized services. originality/value: professional money managers have a stronger short-term orientation than individual investors. lack of wealth (current income and future inheritance) motivates greedy investors to take more risks and become more vulnerable than non-greedy ones—investors’ financial resources and wealth matter. the matthew effect in investment decisions exists in pakistan’s emerging economy. © 2022, emerald publishing limited."
"purpose: this study aimed to evaluate the impact of risk attitude and holding risk-free and risky assets on investors’ happiness. it also aimed to study investors’ demographic differences in risk attitude and happiness. evaluation of the impact of age and family size of investors on their risk attitudes was another aim of this study. methodology: this study evaluated the impact of three independent variables, viz, holding risk-free assets, holding risky assets, and risk attitude on one dependent variable, i.e., investors’ happiness with an investment decision. a sample survey of 409 newly employed individuals having work experience of less than five years was conducted in vidarbha, india. the data was analyzed by using multiple regression and manova using the spss software. findings: investor satisfaction has been demonstrated to have a modest, positive, and significant association with risk attitude. the contentment of investors was significantly impacted by both holding risk-free and risky assets. it was discovered that there were significant gender differences in investors’ happiness. nonetheless, there was no discernible variation in investors’ levels of enjoyment based on their income or marital status. practical implications: this research has significant implications for managers in understanding the various facets of the investment behavior of youth and demographic differences in their investment behavior. financial advisors would be able to plan their sales pitches by referring to the results. originality: in contrast to earlier studies on behavioral finance, the current work examined the topics of investment behavior in the indian setting, with a focus on risk attitude, involvement in the financial market, and satisfaction of recently hired people. © 2024, associated management consultants pvt. ltd.. all rights reserved."
"behavioral household finance shows that people are often more willing to spend when using less tangible forms of money like debit cards or digital payments than when spending in cash. we show that this “payment effect” cannot be generalized to mobile money. we surveyed families in rural northwest bangladesh, where mobile money is mainly received from relatives working in factories. the surveys were embedded within an experiment that allows us to control for the relationships between senders and receivers of mobile money. the finding suggests that the source of funds matters, and mobile money is earmarked for particular purposes and thus less fungible than cash. in contrast to the expectation of greater spending, the willingness to spend in the rural sample was lower by 24 to 31 percent. in urban areas, where the sample does not receive remittances on net, there are no payment effects associated with mobile money. © 2024 the author(s)"

"purpose: the cognitive biases exhibited by investors could hinder their capacity for logical reasoning and impact their perception and reaction to information when making financial choices. so, this study was done to identify the behavioral biases that hinder investors' sound decision-making at the pakistan stock exchange (psx). design/methodology/approach: a cross-sectional study was undertaken employing a causal research design approach. questionnaires were administered to individual investors of the psx as the data collection methodology. the data were subsequently analyzed through the utilization of the smart pls structural equation modeling (sem) technique. findings: the results suggest that information factors and cognitive biases, namely home bias, geographical bias, investor sentiment, salience, and over/under reaction have a positive association with the investors' choices at psx. research limitations/implications: the study’s emphasis is on the impact of behavioral biases on individual investors only, even though such biases also influence the investment decisions of institutional investors. practical implications: the study holds implications for scholars engaged in the field of behavioral finance as well as professionals involved in the stock market, particularly those interacting with individual investors and personal finance. additionally, the current study will take into account investors, financial advisors, practitioners, policymakers, investment experts, stakeholders or target groups, etc. to support various groups in their professional activity and to help them overcome such biases that influence their sound decision-making power. originality/value: the innovative aspect of this research is its ability to advance the understanding of the conceptual underpinnings and social structure of behavioral biases by critically analyzing the body of prior research and adding value to the existing body of literature on behavioral finance in pakistan by investigating the combined impact of never-studied variables, i.e. geographical bias and information variables, understudied behavioral variables, i.e. home bias and salience and studied variables, i.e. investor sentiment and over/under reaction on individual investor investment decisions at psx. © 2024, emerald publishing limited."
"the size premium has been challenged along many fronts, however, according to the “size matters if you control your junk” these challenges are dismantled when controlling for the quality, or the inverse “junk”. and recently, covid has hit the market, according to “stock return and the covid-19 pandemic: evidence from canada and the us”, there is a wide-ranging impact. at the same time, the effect of the covid pandemic has hit the us market and showed giant changes. in order to find out whether the qmj factor is still useful during the new period. this article focuses on the impact during the covid on size premiums. the research methodology was inspired by “a five-factor asset pricing model”, “the capital asset pricing model: theory and evidence”, “momentum” and “the cost of mass gatherings during a pandemic”. note that, according to “market efficiency, longterm returns, and behavioral finance”, the qmj factor may enhance the prominence of size premium. this is the focus of this article. this article provides a more accurate forecasting model in the new era to help predict the size effect that will occur in the market. © 2025 the author(s)."
"group investment decisions confront the challenge of meeting diverse needs. existing practice seems to be mostly ad hoc. even where model based, it may be too complex or idealistic to be implemented. this article proposes an extension to the expected utility framework for simplified group asset allocation. the authors' approach combines utility functions using positive linear weights, accommodating variations in risk aversion, tax treatment, allocation frequency, funding risks, and nominal versus inflation-adjusted returns. by incorporating personal portfolios within a portfolio network to be optimized simultaneously with a pooled portfolio, potential conflicts among group members are further reduced. the procedure employs multiple matrixes to represent return probabilities as they affect the ability to safeguard goals as viewed by each individual. behavioral finance's goal-based investing is simplified using rubinstein utility to seek growth while reducing the probability of failure to meet group member goals. for those able to produce financial plans with positive surplus, rubinstein utility also supports more objectively appropriate risk aversions. the outcome is a practical and rigorous method for strategic group asset allocation. © the author(s) 2023."
"purpose: the paper aims to investigate whether or not a firm’s capital structure can interact with past stock returns to affect future stock returns. specifically, the authors examine whether or not capital structure can help improve momentum profit. design/methodology/approach: the authors use the us common stocks data from 1965 to 2022 to empirically examine the impact of capital structure on momentum profit. findings: when capital structure is measured either as the ratio of debt to asset or the ratio of liability to asset, we all find out that momentum strategies tend to be more profitable for stocks with large capital structure. originality/value: besides documenting the empirical evidence of the impact of capital structure on momentum profit, the authors also present a simple explanation for their empirical results and show that their finding is consistent with the behavioral finance theory that characterizes investors’ increased psychological bias and the more limited arbitrage opportunity when the estimation of firm value becomes more difficult or less accurate. © 2024, emerald publishing limited."
"when having less money than needed, people experience financial scarcity. here, we conducted a laboratory experiment to investigate whether financial scarcity increases financial avoidance – the tendency to avoid dealing with ones finances. participants completed an incentivized task where they managed the finances of a household by earning income and paying expenses across multiple rounds. we manipulated participants’ financial situation such that they either had sufficient (financial abundance) or insufficient (financial scarcity) financial resources. at the end of each round, participants received an additional expense in the form of a letter. to measure financial avoidance in the form of attentional disengagement, we used an eye-tracker and assessed whether participants in the financial scarcity condition avoided looking at the expense letters. as a behavioral measure of financial avoidance, participants had the option to delay the payment of these expenses until the end of the experiment at no additional cost. results showed no effect of financial scarcity on the eye-tracking measure, but there was an effect on the behavioral measure: participants that experienced financial scarcity were more likely to delay payments. the behavioral finding corroborates the notion that financial scarcity can lead to financial avoidance. we explore potential reasons for the null-effect on the eye-tracking measure and discuss how future research can build upon our findings. © the author(s) 2024."
"heuristics and biases are a widely researched topic in the field of behavioral finance. yet, most studies only investigate the effects of heuristics and biases under laboratory conditions and consequently do not consider that financial decisions are likely to be made quite differently under laboratory conditions than in real life. therefore, the purpose of our study is to investigate the effects of heuristics on the securities investment decision-making process in real-life financial advice conversations. to this end, we analyze the buying behavior of 200 individually observed retail customers of a german bank. specifically, fifteen securities advisors were instructed to actively induce heuristics to measure how these cognitive biases distort customers' decision making with respect to purchase probability, one-time investment amount, and monthly savings plans. our results indicate that heuristics in judgement affect the likelihood that customers purchase a product at all, but they do not seem to affect the amount of investment or the level of savings plans. © the author(s) 2022."
"purpose: this research explores the relationships between financial awareness and investor satisfaction about retirement planning, particularly in the indian context. we developed a conceptual model involving double moderation effects of post-retirement objectives and external factors influencing investor satisfaction. design/methodology/approach: a carefully crafted survey instrument was designed to collect data from the 480 employees working in six administrative departments in the northern part of india. after checking the measurement properties of the survey instrument through the lisrel package of structural equation modeling, the hypotheses were tested using hayes process macros. findings: the results indicate that financial awareness is positively related to (1) investor satisfaction and (2) investment purpose; investment purpose is positively related to investor satisfaction; post-retirement objectives moderate the relationship between financial awareness and investment purpose; external factors moderate the moderated relationship between financial awareness and post-retirement objectives (first moderator) and investor satisfaction mediated through investment purpose. practical implications: the outcomes of this study have important implications for the employees embarking on making decisions concerning their retirement. the conceptual model provides a simple framework explaining how financial awareness and investor satisfaction are affected by the post-retirement objectives of individuals. this study highlights the importance of considering the effect of external factors influencing financial decisions. originality/value: the three-way interactions in this exploratory research contribute to the growing literature on behavioral finance, particularly concerning retirement planning involving pension. © 2024, emerald publishing limited."
"bd and ai are now transforming the banking and finance industry at a very fast pace, which is leading to change in the banking and finance institutions. this change is making them better, customer-oriented and financially rewarding organizations. big data and ai have been useful in the banking and financial institutions to assess and manage the risks. through the analysis of big amounts of unstructured data in real time, ai algorithms are capable of identifying risks. this makes it easy to put preventive measures in place to avert the risks. in addition, big data and ai have come a long way in solving the problem of fraud in banking and finance. this paper showed how big data and ai improve risk management, cyber threat, and fraud in banking and finance by using data analysis and data pattern identification in real-time. that is why our work emphasizes the importance of implementing secure privacy and explaining the ai algorithm to eliminate ethical and cyber security issues. using analytical approaches, ai can identify the transactions with the help of comparison with the previous data and the behavioral characteristics related to the fraud. this approach to fraud prevention has been effective in reducing losses while at the same time improving the customer’s confidence in the company. on the other hand, there are disadvantages of big data and ai such as privacy, security, and ethical issues. measures that can be used to safeguard customer information have to be employed in order to effectively safeguard the consumer data. furthermore, transparency and accountability of the ai algorithms are crucial in order to avoid unfair decisions. © 2024, american scientific publishing group (aspg). all rights reserved."
"budget scholars have long theorized the impact of citizen engagement in the budget process. however, there is a void in the literature on modern types of engagement such as online budget simulations. basic questions like what governments can do to increase the level of engagement and what effects such changes have on outcomes remain unanswered. using a behavioral public budget and finance framework, we designed and tested an experiment with a local government budget simulation and varied the starting condition between balance, surplus, and deficit to assess the impact of starting condition on relevant outcomes of engagement and budgetary preferences. results show that two measures of engagement and most budget preferences were influenced by the starting condition. field-in-lab experiments like this one have the potential to further develop behavioral budget theory and be used to test online government platforms that are used by governments for engagement and many other purposes. © 2023 public financial publications, inc."

"us investors’ behavioral finance and investment decision-making approach became a concern during the covid-19 pandemic era as the capital market crashed. the study used mediation analysis to explain how or why the covid-19 pandemic intervened in the causal association of behavioral finance concepts of heuristic techniques and cognitive biases on their investment decision-making. this causal research design study was based on 500 snowball-sampled us investors who answered self-constructed, validated, and reliability-tested likert-scale quantitative variables measured through a first-party data collection approach. the results showed that the covid-19 pandemic was a specific moderate to partial significant mediator on the low positive significant relationships between heuristic techniques and investment decision-making, and the covid-19 pandemic was a specific moderate to full significant mediator on the low positive not significant relationships between cognitive biases and investment decision-making among us investors. from the point of view of behavioral finance, the covid-19 pandemic situation clearly and significantly demonstrated how us investors used 75.6% heuristics techniques (calculated guesses based on prior knowledge) and 87.5% cognitive biases (unintentional errors in their worldview) to cause the crash of the capital market. these findings confirm the rational expectations theory. © 2024, online academic press. all rights reserved."
"this study delves into the innovative application of artificial intelligence (ai) to address the longstanding issue of emotional decision-making in financial markets, which has been a significant factor in exacerbating stock market crashes. by comparing historical market data during two notable periods of financial distress - the 2008 global financial crisis and the 2020 market downturn triggered by the covid-19 pandemic - against the backdrop of predictions made by ai models devoid of emotional biases, this research illuminates the potential of ai to instill a level of rationality in trading decisions that is often compromised by human emotions such as fear and greed. through a meticulous analysis employing various sophisticated ai and machine learning algorithms, the findings distinctly highlight that ai possesses the ability not only to predict market trends with a high degree of accuracy but also to suggest that a market guided by ai-driven decisions could potentially experience reduced volatility and shallower downturns. these insights point to a promising future where ai could serve as an invaluable tool for investors, potentially leading to more stable markets and improved financial outcomes. however, the integration of ai into the financial decision-making process raises important ethical considerations and necessitates the development of robust regulatory frameworks to manage the systemic risks associated with widespread automation. the paper advocates for an interdisciplinary approach to further explore the synergies between ai technology, behavioral finance theories, and ethical standards, aiming to harness the full potential of ai in fostering a more resilient and efficient financial ecosystem. this research contributes to the evolving dialogue on the role of ai in finance, offering a foundation for future investigations into the optimal integration of technological advancements with human insight to mitigate the impact of emotional biases on market dynamics. © 2024 ieee."
"this study examines the impact of subjective norm, attitude and perceived control behavior (financial literacy) on investors’ behavioral intention to invest in mutual funds based on the theory of planned behavior. we have applied structural equation modelling - path analysis to examine the influence of financial literacy, subjective norms, and attitude on the behavioral investment intention of mutual fund investors. the study’s findings indicate that investors’ choice to invest in a mutual fund is positively prejudiced by their subjective norms, attitude, and financial literacy. subjective norms significantly influence investment decisions more than attitude and financial literacy. age, gender, and level of education have no moderating effect on attitude, subjective norms, and financial literacy. the study is proved to be unique to the literature on behavioral finance. the study’s findings are eye-opening as the investment intentions in the mutual fund are influenced by subjective norms, indirectly signaling that investors lack awareness of mutual fund investment. © the author(s), under exclusive licence to springer japan kk, part of springer nature 2024."
"the arrival of new information, in conjunction with investor cognitive biases, has commonly been acknowledged as the main cause of herding behavior. however, whether past market information embedded in market memory influences investor herding has been less explored. we utilize tick-level trading data from the chinese stock market to examine the impact of the market memory formed of stocks' exceptional performance during their initial trading days on the future herding behavior of retail investors. the empirical results show that the market memory of newly listed stocks is positively correlated with retail investor herding one year later at the appearance of a market-wide upward trend. we also propose an advance reaction channel in which retail investors tend to pay early attention to and preemptively invest in stocks with deep market memory due to their limited attention and the availability heuristic, leading to further herding due to confirmation bias. our findings show that market information, if not fully incorporated into current stock prices through investor trading, can be partly stored in market memory. when activated by specific market conditions, market memory can be recalled and affect investor behavior and subsequent price dynamics. our findings provide additional evidence to challenge the efficient market hypothesis (emh) from the perspective of behavioral finance. © 2024 elsevier b.v."

"this paper presents a study of volatility using the non-arbitrage valuation of equities as its foundation. the main objectives are (i) to develop a theory of volatility consistent with an asset pricing model, (ii) to theoretically explain the fundamental origins of volatility and (iii) to assess whether certain a-priori characteristics of volatility, predicted by the theory, are empirically observed. by integrating equity premium and volatility models, the framework provides an alternative approach to understand the relationship between risk and returns. it establishes a causal connection between business risk and equity price movements, offering an economic rationale for the existence of volatility. the framework's predictive ability regarding volatility asymmetry and the low-volatility phenomena enhances an understanding in these areas. this research contributes to the literature on non-arbitrage valuation of equities, as well as to the literature on volatility asymmetry and the low-volatility phenomena. the theoretical justification for volatility's existence challenges the foundations of behavioral finance, which often emphasizes the difficulty of explaining equity price fluctuations solely through rational arguments.  © 2024 world scientific publishing company."

"this chapter delves into the extensive ramifications of the covid-19 pandemic on macroeconomic expectations across a spectrum of sectors within economies. expanding beyond prevailing research on consumer expectations and their interplay with macroeconomic indicators, this chapter encompasses sectors such as services, industry, finance, and retail—all of which have been significantly disrupted by the pandemic's repercussions. employing a latent factor model coupled with gmm techniques, the analysis constructs scenarios representing heightened, diminished, and unchanged covid-19 infections and fatalities. concurrently, the mmr model scrutinizes the intricate relationship between fatalities and the expectations held by economic agents in the european union. the findings that emerge underscore a prevailing sense of pessimism across these varied sectors, bringing attention to a fascinating trend where nations with divergent fatality rates exhibit akin behavioral responses. furthermore, the study uncovers that reductions in fatalities lack the equivalent positive sway on expectations, when contrasted with the negative sway generated by upswings. by augmenting our comprehension of how sectors respond to macroeconomic shocks over time, this research provides indispensable insights into the broader implications of the virus on economies within the eu. in so doing, it contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the pandemic's cascading effects. © the author(s), under exclusive license to springer nature singapore pte ltd. 2024."
"the united states is considered the world’s leading center of economic power, which, in particular, is determined by the role played by the u.s. stock market in the world economy. largely due to the capacity of this market, the u.s. dollar plays the role of the dominant world currency. the state of the u.s. financial market is important for global financial stability. this determines the importance of finding the factors that determine the dynamics of the u.s. stock market. in this article, the author offers his chronology of post-war financial cycles in the united states and analyses them in light of the changing social narratives that accompanied these cycles. reviewing the literature on financial cyclicality and financial bubbles, the author argues that the efficient market hypothesis can be enriched by research from behavioral finance. as the author suggests, stock prices may reflect not only economic and financial information, but also a broader set of information signals. the author proposes to consider narratives as such information signals that can be used by investors in the decision-making process. in conditions of mass influx of retail investors into the market, the importance of narratives as information signals increases and their connection with market dynamics becomes even clearer. the author sets the boundaries of three long-term periods of market development (1949–1974, 1974–2003, 2003–2021) and then analyses these periods to identify distinct phases of market growth and decline. in order to identify such phases, the author uses a simple rule of decreasing minima: in the case of a general growth trend of the stock index, interrupted by its short-term falls (corrections), its minimum value after each correction is greater than the minimum value of the previous correction. the moment when the index falls below the previous minimum value can be considered as the end of the upward phase of the market. according to the chronology of financial cycles proposed by the author, in the entire post-war period there is an alternation of long-term and shortterm periods of growth of stock market quotations. by analyzing their variability, the author concludes that there are relatively stable market patterns that can be repeated in the future. at the same time, the author notes that the influence of non-economic events, in particular geopolitical conflicts and crises, sudden shocks such as a pandemic, weakens the predictive nature of historical cyclicality. in the author’s opinion, under these conditions, the importance of analyzing narratives as information signals increases significantly, as they usually reflect all the key events and phenomena that attract people’s attention. © 2024, russian academy of sciences. all rights reserved."
"information disclosure policies influence nearly every consumer domain. disclosure research across various sectors, particularly finance and nutrition, demonstrates how policymakers can enhance consumer decision-making and promote a fair marketplace. in particular, five key considerations make policies more effective: understanding existing consumer preferences, capturing and maintaining consumer attention, providing actionable knowledge, anticipating firm responses, and recognizing potential perverse effects of information provision. an overarching “theory of change” organizes these considerations and other steps to reveal how disclosure policy can promote consumer well-being. implementing disclosure policies using these psychological and behavioral insights will maximize their effectiveness. © the author(s) 2024."

"purpose: this study aims to examine the relationships between various components of digital financial literacy, namely, awareness, subjective knowledge, experience, the digital legal framework and skills, and their influence on the adoption of cashless payment systems among university affiliates in jordan. it also explores the mediating role of gender in this relationship. the study integrates the theory of planned behavior (tpb) and social role theory (srt). design/methodology/approach: this study uses a cross-sectional survey across 34 jordanian universities. data from 418 participants were analyzed, focusing on factor analysis to assess the constructs' reliability and validity and to explore the moderating effects. findings: the findings illuminate that digital financial awareness, experience and skills are significant catalysts for using cashless payments among the targeted demographic. in contrast, the digital legal framework and subjective financial knowledge did not significantly influence cashless payment use. additionally, gender differences emerged, highlighting a stronger association between digital financial experience and cashless payment usage for women. originality/value: the study's uniqueness stems from its detailed analysis of digital financial literacy's effect on cashless payment adoption in jordan's academia, incorporating aspects like legal frameworks, awareness, and skills. it innovatively considers gender's moderating role, adding fresh insights into digital finance practices. using the tpb and srt, the research connects theory with jordan's empirical data, suggesting strategies for education and policy. this work advances understanding of digital financial literacy in fostering a more inclusive digital financial system, contributing significantly to digital finance and behavioral economics literature. © 2024, emerald publishing limited."
"purpose: the recent economic changes in india and the gender discrimination practices of the patriarchal society have forced indian women to turn to the financial sector as an essential means of generating returns. this study aims to identify the factors influencing investors’ investment frequency in india’s two most recognized metropolitan areas. design/methodology/approach: the authors applied structural equation modeling to augment allport’s consumer behavior model and the social influence theory for assessing the frequency of investments made by 690 investors. the direct and indirect linkages in the proposed model were evaluated using moderation and mediation techniques. findings: the study’s findings show that investors’ perceptions of gender discrimination practices and social influence considerably increase investors’ involvement, magnifying their investment frequency. in addition, access to reliable information reinforces the relationship between investors’ involvement and their frequency of investments, whereas the low-risk tolerance weakens this association. research limitations/implications: the findings could help policymakers, investors, financial media outlets, financial experts, educational institutions and society strengthen india’s financial sector by leveraging the linkage between the underlying constructs and investors’ behavior. originality/value: the aspects of involvement and gender inequality have not garnered enough attention in the previous studies on behavioral finance. the study delves deeper into investor behavior by establishing a link between the underlying constructs and broadening the horizons of prominent consumer behavior models. it also unfurls the moderating role of access to information and risk tolerance to comprehend the association better. © 2024, emerald publishing limited."
"financial literacy is crucial to financial inclusion and facilitates access to and use of formal financial services and products. this study aims to investigate the role of financial literacy in improving financial inclusion among pakistan’s women (a country characterized by a high gender gap and lower financial inclusion). a positivist philosophy was adopted and a survey design using a self-administered structured questionnaire was used to collect data from a sample of working women and university graduates. initially, a pilot test was conducted on a sample of 80 respondents to confirm the reliability and validity of the questionnaire used. final sample of 478 respondents was analyzed using inferential descriptive statistics and covariance-based structural equation modeling (cbsem). the findings demonstrate that different aspects of financial literacy, i.e., savings management practice, debt management practice, investment management practice, and financial planning management practice, have a significant positive impact on financial inclusion among women. the findings are supported by theories of behavioral finance (i.e., self-efficacy and goal setting theory) and institutional theory. the study contributes to the existing literature on the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion and has implications for policymakers and practitioners in the financial sector in pakistan. © the author(s), under exclusive licence to springer science+business media, llc, part of springer nature 2023."
"the formation of perceptions and expectations regarding the availability of external financing is a critical area of research for monetary policy, particularly in light of the covid-19 pandemic and the ongoing energy crisis. this study utilizes data from the semi-annually conducted survey on the access to finance of enterprises (safe). the data covers the time period from april 2014 to september 2022. our aim is to investigate how smes perceive and expect the availability of bank loans, credit lines, and trade credits. our findings highlight that past experiences and changing demands for financing are significant drivers in shaping both past perceptions and future expectations. behavioral factors such as loss aversion and rational inattention play a crucial role in influencing managerial decisions. these insights help explain the persistent low credit dynamics observed since the financial crisis and suggest similar trends may follow the current economic disruptions. our results underscore the importance of considering behavioral elements and past experiences in designing effective monetary policies to support smes’ access to finance. © 2024, institute of geography of the slovak academy of science. all rights reserved."
"using unique survey data from the china household finance survey, we estimate the extent of “narrow framing”, which is a widely documented behavioral bias, among chinese households, using their portfolio choices. conditional on stock market participation, we find that most chinese households exhibit significant narrow framing. based on the obtained estimates, we show that narrow framing positively predicts the extent of under-diversification. most importantly, we argue that narrow framing is an irreplaceable of understanding households' portfolio choices, even after considering measurement error and a wide set of indicators of diversification. © 2023 elsevier inc."

"background: adequate nutrition has been cited as one of the most critical components for optimal health outcomes during pregnancy. women in burkina faso and madagascar experience high rates of undernutrition due to lack of knowledge, finances, cultural norms, and autonomy. therefore, this study aimed (1) to describe typical maternal diets during pregnancy in burkina faso and madagascar, (2) to understand the multilevel factors that influence women’s nutrition decision-making, and (3) to explore the extent to which women have nutrition decision-making autonomy during pregnancy. methods: this study was conducted between october 2020 and february 2021 in burkina faso and madagascar. semi-structured interviews, focus group interviews, and free lists were conducted among women of reproductive age and pregnant and lactating women. textual data from interviews were recorded and translated verbatim from local languages into french. the food choice process model guided textual content analysis using dedoose software. free list data were analyzed using cultural domain analysis approaches. results: in burkina faso and madagascar, women primarily consumed staple foods such as rice and tô during pregnancy. participants cited eating fruits and vegetables when available, while the animal source foods were rarely consumed. across both contexts, nutrition during pregnancy was influenced by factors that impact food choices, such as social factors, resources, ideals, and personal factors. while women and men in madagascar had more shared decision-making on critical domains such as finances, men were the primary decision-makers in most areas of inquiry (eg, finances) in burkina faso. conclusions: the lack of adequate diverse diet consumed during pregnancy is primarily due to important factors including social factors and resources. understanding the ability for women to consume optimal diets during pregnancy is needed to target behavioral change in maternal nutrition programming. © the author(s) 2023."
"purpose: the emergence of cryptocurrency has developed a new payment system that is changing how financial transactions happen in hospitality. consumers/travelers have started experimenting with cryptocurrency payments in hotels and restaurants. however, extant research is lacking in understanding the consumer adoption intention of cryptocurrency payments. this study investigates the intention to use cryptocurrency payments in the hospitality industry. design/methodology/approach: the conceptual model in this study is based on the behavioral reasoning theory, and it explores the motivating and deterring factors influencing the adoption of cryptocurrency payments in the hospitality industry. a quantitative survey was conducted among 1,080 consumers to examine and confirm the model, with data being analyzed through the partial least squares structural equation modeling (pls-sem) method. findings: the outcome of this work showed that the “reasons for” positively influence and “reasons against” negatively influence consumers’ attitudes and use intentions. consumers’ values of openness to change positively influence the “reasons for” and do not influence the “reasons against” and attitude toward the use of cryptocurrency payments. practical implications: this work contributes to practice by providing insights to customers (users/payee), hospitality managers (investors) and organizations/firms (receiving crypto payments) as well as to financial firms and the government. originality/value: this research contributes to cryptocurrency payment adoption and behavioral finance literature. the research uniquely provides the adoption and inhibiting factors for cryptocurrency payment in an integrated framework in the hospitality sector. © 2024, emerald publishing limited."
"background: antimicrobial resistance is a worldwide public health problem. antimicrobial stewardship programs (asps) optimize antimicrobial use within hospitals. the social marketing framework has been used in analyzing systems and devising best practices. objective: (s): to use the social marketing framework to explore pharmacist experiences and perceptions of structural, behavioral and interventional strategies that support asps. methods: a qualitative approach utilizing semi-structured individual interviews was utilized. a purposive sample of hospital pharmacists was invited to participate. an interview guide was constructed to describe participant experience and perceptions regarding asps in their institutions based on elements of social marketing: behavioral goals; customer insight; segmentation and targeting; competition; exchange; and marketing and interventional mix. interviews were recorded digitally and transcribed verbatim. thematic analysis was conducted using deductive methods. a combination of case-based and code-based approaches allowed individual and holistic analyses respectively. codes were collated into themes and subthemes. results: saturation of themes occurred with 25 interviews from 17 hospitals. asp metrics included: consumption of antibiotics using days of therapy and defined daily dose, rates of c. difficile and multidrug resistant organisms, resistance patterns, and provider adherence to the asp. active stewardship tools such as preauthorization, and prospective feedback/audit were preferred over passive tools such as order sets and automatic stop orders. a physician champion and a clinical pharmacist with infectious disease training were core elements in the multidisciplinary team. despite certain areas being considered key for stewardship, participants emphasized a hospital-wide approach including outpatient departments; discharge stewardship emerged as a primary theme. leadership supported asps with finances, rapid and novel diagnostics, clinical decision support systems, mobile technology, and continuous staff training. conclusions: the social marketing framework has been used to explore pharmacist perceptions that inform successful qualities including metrics, restriction methods, personnel, benefits, barriers, training needs/modes, and promotional avenues that support asps in hospitals. © 2023 elsevier inc."
"using a behavioral finance framework, this study extends traditional portfolio selection theory and traditional asset pricing theory to accommodate environmental, social, and governance (esg) investing. there are two behavioral innovations to behavioral portfolio selection. first, investors have preferences over the sources of their returns, which involves intangible benefits, possibly influenced by financial firms’ marketing efforts. second, investors are vulnerable to biased judgments about esg impact and return distributions. the first innovation leads to a different notion of diversification than the traditional approach. this innovation also impacts the character of asset pricing, especially the nature of mean–variance efficiency, risk-free securities (green and brown), and arbitrage. the author discusses conditions under which esg asset pricing features a natural factor pricing structure. in some circumstances, the resulting equilibrium will conform to the capm with a single pricing factor—the market portfolio. in other circumstances, there will be more than one factor, and one of the factors will be the market portfolio. in yet other circumstances, there will be more than one factor, but the market portfolio will not be among them. this is especially the case in the presence of heterogeneous judgmental errors, both about returns and about esg opacity. copyright 2024 with intelligence llc."
"this paper investigates the key factors driving the capital gains overhang (hereafter cgo) in the us stock market. we used a sample of 3865 non-financial us companies with 331,023 observations from january 2001 through december 2020. the data is analyzed using a panel regression model. it contributes to the literature by using a new set of firm characteristics, namely, liquidity proxied by turnover, company beta, leverage, eps, cash flow to price, market to book ratio, and size. this research is interesting as it provides an alternative to the behavioral finance point of view that serves only limited stylized facts. we find that cgo is increasing in some firm attributes, namely earnings per share, leverage, growth, and size, and decreasing in others, namely turnover, beta, and cash flow to price. our results are robust to cross-sectional regression that checks the stability of estimates over time and to subsample analyses. finally, our results remain the same even after accounting for endogeneity. © the author(s) 2024."
"families can spend years waiting for a developmental assessment. we sought to understand supports caregivers had accessed by the time of their child's first multi-disciplinary developmental assessment, the supports caregivers wanted, and the barriers caregivers reported to accessing these supports. we also sought to understand how government funding schemes (the national disability insurance scheme) and sociodemographic factors influenced access to supports. caregivers were emailed questionnaires on sociodemographic background and intervention history prior to their child's developmental assessment at a tertiary diagnostic and assessment service. results from 202 caregivers showed most children were receiving less than 2 hours of support each week at assessment. the most common accessed supports were from general practitioners and pediatricians. caregivers reported behavioral therapists (41%) and psychologists (29%) as the most desired but inaccessible child supports. half of caregivers nominated a need for parenting interventions. the most frequent barriers to accessing child supports were wait lists, finance, and knowledge. government funding improved access to the total number of services received (from 2.7 to 5.2 different services), but for disability specific services only (e.g., speech and occupational therapy). results highlighted disparities for families without government funding, impacting certain groups (e.g., children over 7 years) and services (e.g., mental health). socioeconomic disadvantage, parental separation, and, surprisingly, being from a non-culturally/linguistically diverse background were associated with fewer services and more barriers. results highlight the need to facilitate access to supports for families to align with existing recommendations. © 2023 the authors. autism research published by international society for autism research and wiley periodicals llc."
"professional judgments in business valuation should be based on persuasive comparative data and conclusive empirical studies. however, these judgments are frequently made without these conditions, causing professional skepticism. an appraiser should explain in detail what was done to get the market value because valuation is the initial crucial step in the investment decision process. in socially responsible investment schemes, an appraiser has a fiduciary duty and a vital role in protecting the public from fraud and the risk of asset value destruction. professional skepticism is essential to direct the appraiser’s judgment towards independent valuation for the public interest, assisting in evaluating the relevance and reliability of information, especially relating to social, environmental, and ethical issues. this paper studies the business valuation process from a behavioral finance perspective in the united states and indonesia, aiming to tweak business valuation practices, identify biases, and mitigate them to ensure the market value does not shift far from fairness opinion. the case study explores experiences from the professional role-learning process. the results highlight the need for an appraisal protocol in business valuation, improvements in the discount for lack of marketability application, and these findings are pertinent to business appraisers and regulators. recommendations include enhancing the clarity of professional judgments and the integration of recent empirical studies into practice. © 2024 by author(s)."
"using chinese data, this paper reveals that climate disaster events have a positive impact on the granting of green invention patents. the occurrence of climate disasters leads the patent-granting officials to overestimate the likelihood of disaster recurrence, strengthens their perception of environmental protection as urgent, and consequently increases the number of patents that they grant. salience bias, the tendency to overestimate probabilities due to the occurrence of salient events, is widely studied in psychology and behavioral finance. this paper extends this research by examining the influence of salience bias on people's behavior in processing green invention patents, with a specific focus on climate disaster events in beijing, the headquarters of china's patent examination authority. in addition to the overall positive impact on granted patent numbers, the paper finds that (i) the influence of salience bias is temporary, with a more pronounced effect on energy-saving patents than on other categories of patents, and (ii) the primary effect is on green invention patents filed by firms in beijing, with the effect of salience bias rapidly diminishing as the distance of the application city from beijing increases. © 2024 john wiley & sons ltd."
"purpose: this article aims to systematically review the literature published in recognized journals focused on cognitive heuristic-driven biases and their effect on investment management activities and market efficiency. it also includes some of the research work on the origins and foundations of behavioral finance, and how this has grown substantially to become an established and particular subject of study in its own right. the study also aims to provide future direction to the researchers working in this field. design/methodology/approach: for doing research synthesis, a systematic literature review (slr) approach was applied considering research studies published within the time period, i.e. 1970–2021. this study attempted to accomplish a critical review of 176 studies out of 256 studies identified, which were published in reputable journals to synthesize the existing literature in the behavioral finance domain-related explicitly to cognitive heuristic-driven biases and their effect on investment management activities and market efficiency as well as on the origins and foundations of behavioral finance. findings: this review reveals that investors often use cognitive heuristics to reduce the risk of losses in uncertain situations, but that leads to errors in judgment; as a result, investors make irrational decisions, which may cause the market to overreact or underreact – in both situations, the market becomes inefficient. overall, the literature demonstrates that there is currently no consensus on the usefulness of cognitive heuristics in the context of investment management activities and market efficiency. therefore, a lack of consensus about this topic suggests that further studies may bring relevant contributions to the literature. based on the gaps analysis, three major categories of gaps, namely theoretical and methodological gaps, and contextual gaps, are found, where research is needed. practical implications: the skillful understanding and knowledge of the cognitive heuristic-driven biases will help the investors, financial institutions and policymakers to overcome the adverse effect of these behavioral biases in the stock market. this article provides a detailed explanation of cognitive heuristic-driven biases and their influence on investment management activities and market efficiency, which could be very useful for finance practitioners, such as an investor who plays at the stock exchange, a portfolio manager, a financial strategist/advisor in an investment firm, a financial planner, an investment banker, a trader/broker at the stock exchange or a financial analyst. but most importantly, the term also includes all those persons who manage corporate entities and are responsible for making their financial management strategies. originality/value: currently, no recent study exists, which reviews and evaluates the empirical research on cognitive heuristic-driven biases displayed by investors. the current study is original in discussing the role of cognitive heuristic-driven biases in investment management activities and market efficiency as well as the history and foundations of behavioral finance by means of research synthesis. this paper is useful to researchers, academicians, policymakers and those working in the area of behavioral finance in understanding the role that cognitive heuristic plays in investment management activities and market efficiency. © 2022, emerald publishing limited."
"this study examines the relationship between managerial reference points and corporate payout policy. we find that share repurchase activity increases as a firm's current stock price declines in relation to the price at which it previously repurchased shares. to facilitate a behavioral interpretation of this relation, we show that it weakens around stock splits, is asymmetric over gains and losses, and strengthens when prior repurchase prices are more salient. further, the relation is not explained by traditional repurchase motives. the results suggest a behavioral pattern in which managers use prior repurchase prices as reference points for current repurchases. © 2023 the eastern finance association."
"purpose: this paper aims to examine how fear of missing out (fomo) and investment intention mediate the relationship between behavioral biases and investment decisions of retail investors in the indian stock market. design/methodology/approach: the present research comprises two cross-sectional quantitative studies, where study a involves data from 405 self-employed and study b involves 393 salaried investors. data was attained through questionnaires – the partial least squares structural equation modeling was used for data analysis. findings: the outcomes show that herding, overconfidence and loss aversion bias significantly impact investment intention and fomo on both studies. furthermore, the outcomes also indicate that herding and loss aversion bias significantly influence investment decisions in studies (a and b); however, overconfidence bias insignificantly affects the investment decisions in study a. besides, the results also reveal a substantial relationship between fomo, investment intention and investment decision. practical implications: the findings of this paper assist practitioners (financial analysts and retail investors) in considering the various ways of analyzing investment decision outcomes by considering the joint effect of several biases. originality/value: this paper is an initial attempt to propose a new theoretical framework and empirically examine the impact of behavioral biases on investment decisions by considering the fomo and investment intention among self-employed and salaried investors. this study also contributes to the behavioral finance literature; other researchers may find it valuable to attain their goals. © 2024, emerald publishing limited."
"sakti is a treasury information system and financial report preparation newly implemented by the ministry of finance in 2022. the piloting phase has been conducted before official implementation to identify various challenges and the development of the application. the implementation of sakti heavily depends on the intention behavior and operator behavior to use the system. therefore, the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (utaut2) framework is used to examine the factors influencing behavioral intention and user behavior of the sakti system. the respondents involved in the study were 271 sakti users at the state treasury service office. hypothesis testing was conducted on the partial least squares-structural model equation (pls-sem) with smartpls 3.29 professional software. the research results provide empirical evidence that social influence and hedonic motivation do not affect the behavioral intention to use sakti. however, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, and habit impact the behavioral intention to use sakti. facilitating conditions, habits, and behavioral intention influences the use of sakti. behavioral intention to use sakti mediates the relationship between facilitating conditions and habit with the behavior of using the sakti system, with partial complementary mediation. the practical implication is that kppn needs to provide special technical guidance for sakti operators to make the system easier for them to use. enhancing security in the sakti application and improving internet capacity are important considerations to maximize the use of sakti. © 2024 the author(s). published by informa uk limited, trading as taylor & francis group."
"many parents cope with the prolonged financial dependence of their emerging adult children and problems arising from sharing a household, which may challenge parental satisfaction with money management (smm) and life satisfaction (ls). we created and tested a conceptual model of potential pathways to parental smm and ls. data were collected in a sample of 482 student–parent pairs via an online survey that included adjusted questionnaires on financial functioning (shim et al., journal of youth and adolescence 39:1457–1470, 2010) and satisfaction with life scale (diener et al., journal of personality assessment 49:71–75, 1985). relying on the model of financial satisfaction from the student perspective (sirsch et al., emerging adulthood 8:509–520, 2020), we proposed pathways of the family ses, financial parenting (explicit teaching and financial behavior; parent report; 22.8% fathers), and parent–child financial relationships (student report; mage = 19.94; 45.2% males) to parental smm and ls. we also anticipated intermediate relations of financial parenting with the students' self-reported financial learning outcomes (cognitive and behavioral/relational). the ses, proactive parental financial behavior, and favorable parent–child financial relationships predicted parental smm and ls. financial parenting was linked to the student's positive financial learning outcomes, but only financial knowledge further influenced the financial relationship with their parents. the findings suggest the benefits of successful parental financial socialization for both the offspring's finance-related outcomes and their parents' satisfaction. © the author(s) 2024."
"given that there is a lack of understanding of the effect of behavioral elements on capital structure decisions and in the context of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries, this study seeks to understand if it exists, and what role does the bias towards the present in capital structure decisions in that context. with a self-administered survey, information was collected to estimate the relationship of the capital structure with the bias towards the present through discount rates at different terms, and subsequently estimate the effect with a multiple linear regression model. the existence of a bias towards the present was found and, the higher its level, the greater the proportion of debt the company has to finance its assets. additionally, the preference for long-term debt is also positively related to total debt. the evidence invites decision makers to question whether these choices are motivated by the needs of the company or by impatience; and governments to provide access to the financial system for these companies that are usually informal. in conclusion, it is suggested to evaluate the bias in large companies and in developed countries for their respective comparison. © licencia de creative commons atribución 4.0 internacional (cc by 4.0) https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.es"
"this study has been set out to map the literature on labor economics from an islamic perspective to identify the concentration of research, gaps in the literature, major obstacles to the development of the field, and how islamic principles can guide policymaking in this area. the literature survey revealed three key themes in the mapping of issues in labor economics from an islamic perspective: religious or cultural, behavioral, and systemic aspects. the religious aspect involves the direct interpretation and/or implementation of islamic principles, rulings and behavioral norms derived from the divine texts in labor economics. the role of culture (‘urf) may have an effect on how religious texts are interpreted, which in turn shapes religious views. the behavioral aspect is concerned with the role of individual behavior, ethics, and morality in shaping labor market outcomes. the systemic aspect is about the shortcomings or loopholes in the economic system that cause problems in the labor market, such as poverty, unemployment, and inequality. in general, the study found that research in labor economics from an islamic perspective is limited compared to other fields like islamic banking and finance. published articles on the topic is relatively scanty, especially in providing deep insights into the theoretical, empirical and policy related perspective. the study identified three main directions of research in labor economics from an islamic perspective: (i) islamic work ethics, (ii) islamic labor markets, and (iii) islamic labor policies. most of the literature are mainly concentrated on addressing the islamic work ethics. © (2024) all rights reserved."
"this study investigates the impacts of behavioral finance on stock market volatility. the primary aims are to explain the reasons behind changes in the sandp 500 price within the context of behavioral finance and to analyze investor behavior in response to these changes. to achieve this, the research employs time-series analysis over a 10-year period, focusing on the sandp 500, real interest rates, consumer confidence, market volatility and credit default swaps while considering the effects of behavioral biases. the findings reveal several significant correlations: rising real interest rates negatively affect stocks due to loss aversion and sentiment. conversely, higher consumer confidence tends to positively influence the stock market, driven by herding behavior and optimism. additionally, market volatility shows a negative correlation with the sandp 500, influenced by risk aversion, recency bias and herding behavior. moreover, an increase in credit default swap rates leads to stock market declines, primarily influenced by risk perception, loss aversion and herding behavior. © 2024 cambridge university press. all rights reserved."
"the growing population and the paramount importance of health in society have underscored the need to manage and analyze extensive patient data. healthcare is a top priority, but it grapples with escalating costs in areas like disease diagnosis, prediction, drug discovery, medical imaging interpretation, personalized medicine, behavioral therapy, and digital health records. machine learning emerges as a crucial tool for processing this data, elevating the efficiency of healthcare systems. accurate diagnosis is pivotal in healthcare, offering vital insights into a patient's condition and guiding treatment decisions. disease diagnosis is a complex and collaborative process, involving the collection and analysis of clinical, intelligent, and data-driven information to reach conclusive diagnoses. machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, continuously learns and refines itself through experience. it extends its applications beyond healthcare to other sectors such as law, marketing, finance, retail, customer services, and addressing healthcare challenges like those posed by covid-19. additionally, ml-driven techniques aid in the early detection of epidemic or pandemic indicators by analyzing satellite data, news reports, and social media, potentially preventing outbreaks. the integration of ml into healthcare opens doors to various possibilities, freeing healthcare providers from administrative burdens to focus on patient care. this paper delves into the essential role of ml in healthcare, exploring its core components and highlighting key applications. implementing ml in healthcare operations can significantly benefit organizations by offering diverse treatment options, personalized care, and enhancing overall system efficiency while reducing costs.  © 2024 ieee."

"the netherlands aims to have a climate-neutral society in 2050, for which a timely climate neutrality of the energy system is crucial. this is challenging as its geographical location with deep sea harbours and abundant low-cost natural gas have led to a relatively high energy intensity of its economy as well as vast accumulation of fossil assets in industry. the energy system is strongly intertwined with other systems, and relevant knowledge is spread across scientific disciplines including finance, innovation, geography, governance, economics, and psychology. this is why the dutch minister for climate and energy asked a team of experts from across all these disciplines for advice on how to achieve a climate-neutral energy system. this study reports on the results of a participative modelling exercise with these experts that was organized to foster a shared understanding of the complexity of the dutch energy system. the multidisciplinary approach identifies governance, fairness, and trust as high leverage points, and we propose policies that intervene in these variables. we contribute to the literature around climate policy by exhibiting the relevance of understanding the interrelations between the disciplines, leading to recommendations for climate policies that are more effective because they acknowledge and do justice to the interrelated nature of the energy system. although other articles have proposed similar policies, our study is different because we suggest how the structure of the system can lead to tipping dynamics, thereby providing a new logic of why these policies deserve more attention. © 2024 the author(s). systems research and behavioral science published by international federation for systems research and john wiley & sons ltd."
"purpose: this study aims to predict stock market crises in the middle east north africa (mena) regions by leveraging the nonlinear autoregressive neural network with exogenous inputs (narx) model with two measures of investor sentiment: the arms indicator and google trends' search volume of positive and negative words. design/methodology/approach: employing a novel approach, this study utilizes the narx model with ten neurons in the hidden layer and the levenberg–marquardt training algorithm. it evaluates model performance through learning, validation and test errors, as well as correlation analysis between predicted and actual crises. findings: the narx model, incorporating investor sentiment, has proven to be a reliable tool for forecasting crises, helping market participants understand data complexity and avoid crisis consequences. the divergence in how investors interpret market news, with some focusing solely on negative developments and others valuing positive outcomes, highlights the predictive nature of the optimistic and pessimistic sentiments captured by the model. research limitations/implications: this study advocates for integrating behavioral approaches into stock market crisis prediction, highlighting the significance of investor sentiment and deep learning. it advances crisis mechanism understanding and opens avenues in behavioral finance. integration of these findings into finance and economics education could enhance students' risk understanding and mitigation strategies. practical implications: the adoption of narx models, incorporating investor sentiment, empowers market participants to proactively manage crises, adjust strategies, enhance asset protection and make informed decisions. these models enable them to minimize losses, maximize returns and diversify portfolios effectively in response to market fluctuations. these insights also guide policymakers such as governments, regulatory institutions and financial organizations in formulating crisis prevention and mitigation policies, bolstering economic and financial stability. social implications: this research reduces economic uncertainty, safeguards individuals' savings and investments and promotes a stable financial climate. originality/value: this study is one of the first attempts to demonstrate the detection and prediction of stock market crises, specifically in the mena stock market, using the narx model. it offers a robust forecasting model using machine learning and investor sentiment, providing decision-making support for investment strategies and policy development aimed at enhancing financial and economic stability. © 2024, emerald publishing limited."
"purpose: this study examines the effects of financial literacy and financial risk tolerance on investor behavior by introducing social stigma as a mediator and emotional intelligence as a moderating factor. design/methodology/approach: data is collected from 761 financially independent individual investors, with a minimum age of 25 years, a minimum of five years of stock market experience and residing in five selected major indian cities. the collected data is subsequently analyzed using smartpls. homogeneous purposive sampling followed by snowball sampling was employed. findings: the findings of the study demonstrate a strong and noteworthy impact of financial literacy on investor behavior. the research reveals that social stigma acts as a partial mediator and emotional intelligence plays a significant moderator with direct effects and indirect effects between financial literacy, financial risk tolerance, social stigma and investor behavior. research limitations/implications: exploring emotional intelligence in financial decisions enriches academic programs by integrating it into financial education. collaboration between academia and financial institutions yields practical tools, infusing emotional intelligence into services. this prompts systemic shifts, reshaping education and societal discourse, fostering inclusive, emotionally intelligent financial landscapes, aiming to redefine both academic teachings and real-world financial practices. practical implications: integrating emotional intelligence into government-led financial literacy programs can transform societal perspectives on financial decision-making. customized services, destigmatizing workshops and collaborative efforts with academia foster an emotionally intelligent financial landscape, reshaping traditional paradigms. social implications: promoting open societal discussions about finances combats stigma, fostering a supportive space for risk-taking. emphasizing emotional intelligence in awareness campaigns cultivates inclusivity and confidence. normalizing financial talks empowers individuals, enhancing their well-being. elevating both financial literacy and emotional intelligence enhances overall financial health, nurturing a community adept at navigating financial journeys. originality/value: this study marks a notable contribution to behavioral finance and social stigma theory by examining their intersection with emotional intelligence. it uniquely introduces social stigma as a mediator and emotional intelligence as a moderator, unexplored in this context. this novelty underscores the research’s significance, offering practical insights into financial well-being. peer review: the peer review history for this article is available at: https://publons.com/publon/10.1108/ijse-08-2023-0626 © 2024, emerald publishing limited."
"psychological observations are by now well integrated into economics, especially in the theory of finance, as can also be seen in the nobel prize awarded to thaler. on the contrary, simon’s attempt to reforge economic theory on the paradigm of bounded rationality failed. starting from the birth of the neoclassical paradigm, we’ll describe the attempt to give it psychological foundations with a direct measurement of utility, then the axiomatic turn of the paradigm and its first anomalies. we’ll then sum up the debate on rationality, taking place in the group of economists led by simon, which brought to the rational expectations hypothesis. finally, we’ll discuss the development of behavioral economics and its progressive acceptance in economic theory. this historical reconstruction allows us to understand the actual hard core of the neoclassical paradigm and the growing need of the paradigm for practical flexibility that determines how to choose arguments, methods and evidence that can be useful to its development, including psychological ones. © the author(s) 2024."
"traditional finance theories rely on rational behavior in investors, who seek to optimize returns through fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and personal judgment. however, recent research has identified inconsistencies in these theories when applied in practical scenarios. retail investors in the equity market are prone to various influences, biases, and emotional factors that can impact their decision-making process. market irregularities arise due to suboptimal responses from investors, who exhibit irrational behavior by deviating from the consistent mathematical framework. behavioral finance, an interdisciplinary field that integrates behavioral and cognitive psychology with traditional economics and finance, aims to elucidate irrational financial decision-making by employing psychological principles and other theories about human behavior. it examines the influence of investors’ emotions and psychology on their investment decision- making processes, focusing on the convergence of intellectual acumen and emotional restraint for rational conduct. warren buffet emphasized the importance of understanding how emotions contribute to irrational behavior, and the examination of investor psychology becomes increasingly intriguing. despite progress in various scientific disciplines, the field of psychology remains relatively nascent. therefore, it is crucial to examine the dynamics of group behavior within markets and the specific behavioral characteristics exhibited by individual investors to achieve success in investment endeavors. © 2024 scrivener publishing llc."
"cryptocurrencies, which have begun to become an important rival to cash due to the changing lifestyle and technological developments, are gradually increasing their coverage area. whether bitcoin prices, which have exhibited different behaviors over the years since the day they were developed, are on a rational basis has become an important topic of discussion. within the scope of this study, bitcoin prices between 2010 and 2023 were analyzed and factors that could make price behavior meaningful were tried to be determined. in addition, a forecast was also made in which bitcoin prices for the coming years were calculated on a daily basis together with various statistical parameters using the the triple exponential smoothing method based on same historical data, and the results were discussed from various perspectives. in bitcoin prices, which change mainly within the framework of supply and demand balance, attention has been drawn to the importance of different factors such as rational or irrational herd behavior, decisions taken about bitcoin or news that may affect this balance and fall within the scope of behavioral finance. along with the behavioral finance parameters that will make bitcoin price behavior meaningful, it may not always be possible to attribute some changes in the relevant data to a specific reason. the main view supporting this situation is based on the personal nature of cryptocurrency itself. © 2024 by university of niš, serbia."
"the current research investigates the association between demographic factors, including financial knowledge and demographic characteristics like gender, occupation, age, education, and income, and investor behavior biases, including bias against overconfidence, disposition effect, and herding bias. further enhancement of behavioural finance research is required in indonesia. this study applied a quantitative analysis technique called structural equation modeling. stock investors aged 17 and 40 were given questionnaires for this study. respondent data collection was carried out by distributing questionnaires through several social media sites, such as line, whatsapp, and instagram, to members of the investor’s community. the total number of respondents obtained from distributing this questionnaire was 170. according to the study, overconfidence bias significantly affects income and financial literacy. however, overconfidence bias does not affect gender, occupation, investment experience, education, or age. furthermore, for behavioral biases, the disposition effect does not affect financial literacy or all demographic factors. finally, for herding behavior bias, bias significantly affects financial literacy, investment experience, and income, but herding bias does not affect gender, occupation, education, age, or income. these results have implications for investors with a high level of financial literacy, which will help them determine rational investment decisions. this research also has implications for high-income investors who tend not to follow herding behavior. © 2024 asian economic and social society. all rights reserved."

"typically, individuals tend to under-invest in financial markets. meanwhile, financial market participation always takes place with some form of nudging, which can particularly be introduced as priming of potential clients. through a survey of 2107 individuals from 5 european countries, we show that, in line with the somatic marker hypothesis, priming significantly reduces participation in the stock market for individuals who fail to be emotionally moved while significantly increasing stock market participation for those who feel strong emotions due to this priming. moreover, emotions and financial literacy interact so that less financially literate investors typically participate more in financial markets when they are impacted by emotions compared to highly financially literate investors. in terms of managerial implication, the results testify to the need for targeted priming of individuals. © 2024 the institute of behavioral finance."
"purpose: financial anxiety has become a global concern and a growing research area with significant potential to contribute to the behavioral and personal finance literature. despite this, the literature is fragmented and inconsistent. prior studies vary greatly in the breadth of definitions and measures of financial anxiety. there has been no systematic evaluation of literature on financial anxiety antecedents, consequences, and coping strategies. this systematic review fills this gap. design/methodology/approach: we followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (prisma) guidelines. we searched scopus and web of science and identified 55 eligible studies published between 2009 and 2024. findings: financial anxiety is defined and measured differently in different research domains. we identified several antecedents, including socio-demographic factors (e.g. gender, age, ethnicity, income, employment, racial background, and language proficiency), personality traits, compulsive and impulsive buying behavior, depression or other mental issues, family health issues, and the covid-19 pandemic and consequences of financial anxiety, including psychological and psychic health, societal and personal relations, financial behavior and well-being, and job-related outcomes. in addition, the literature presents six financial anxiety coping strategies (self-imposed coping mechanisms, spiritual and theological resources, increased financial capability, social and family support, seeking professional help, and language proficiency training). several future research directions are presented. originality/value: this review represents the first systematic compilation and evaluation of the research findings on financial anxiety. © 2024, emerald publishing limited."
"economic security of the national state is traditionally considered to be implemented only at macro level of the national economy. however, a new reality of the xxi era has shown that the key aspects of the national security are being arisen at micro level of economic activity. innovations have created not only new factors for prosperity but given birth to specific risks and novel threats for the national state. digital ecosystems (dess) that have just come to light have been generating a host of state threatening consequences. nowadays most if not all of the largest world companies are parts of digital ecosystems. market capitalization, total sales and total business operations of the digital ecosystems equal or even exceed the gross domestic product of many independent states. a typical profile of a digital ecosystem comprises such characteristics as self-regulation and independent business; vague industry and geographic frontiers; absence of clear inner structural elements within the firm; absence or minimization of material (brick-and-stone) assets. the services of the digital ecosystems lie in a variety of highly different production, transportation, market, and after-market spheres including finance and logistics. the intangible power of dess is based on ict technology, e. g., m2m and iot, which could work in an autonomous regime even off wi-fi areas. cloud computing, fog computing and edge computing allow to storage and manipulate big data over the firms’ boundaries and stay off the government control. although m2m interactions are good for telemedicine, industrial security, payment systems, etc., smart digital activity of dess might be harmful for national economic security. firstly, as digital ecosystems are collecting huge amount of private data, they have access to more subtle behavioral aspects of individuals than government offices. using their private databases, dess could influence clients in both economic and political areas. secondly, digital cartels could implement brand-new types of price discrimination which are out of government regulations. dynamic pricing in both sides of the digital platforms (for content providers and for consumers) could add to national inflation rates. thirdly, information that is used to elaborate and implement government economic policy could be easily manipulated within dess due to low quality of it operators or because of hacker-driven misinformation. it means that the critically important statistics are in fact in the hands of the digital ecosystems, which have been transforming into tacit co-partners of government economic and social policy. in social sphere dess have introduced a special business model, that is, worker-on-demand. like video on demand or car sharing, employees can be hired temporarily with no labour contracts, no social security plans, no any feasible limitations on time, place, and conditions of work. quantity of labour force, level of wages, and other important elements of working life are in the hands of algorithmic management, a special it program elaborated by dess’ specialists in the interests of the dess. such practices of labour market undermine the government social policy and increase social tensions. digital ecosystems have changed labour resources in the direction of cyber wars. in order to defense their own infrastructure and virtual space of their activity, dess are in the process of establishing their own cyber-army. the des employees usually act as potential (and actual sometimes) cyber-worriers in detecting and eliminating unsanctioned penetration in digital nets of the company. the problems of digital ecosystems having too much economic power are being under consideration in many countries. for example, in china in 2021 the government replaced its former liberal it policy for tight it regulation of dess. thus, thinking about national economic security, we should take into account a new digital reality in forms of digital ecosystems and their desire (consciously or unconsciously) to substitute national state in its significant economic and social functions. © 2024, russian academy of sciences. all rights reserved."
"a signal that identifies asset pricing bubbles would be valuable so investors could reposition their portfolios to weather the bubble, yet ex ante bubble identification has proven illusory. arif and sul (2024) study whether industry-level investment in net operating asset (noa) accruals is an ex ante accounting-based signal that predicts bubbles. using industry-level price run-ups across 49 countries, they find that noa accruals predict a higher likelihood of a future crash, lower future returns, and larger analyst forecast errors, especially following run-up periods. the authors attribute these patterns to sentiment-driven overinvestment. my discussion summarizes the contributions of arif and sul's findings to the asset pricing bubbles, behavioral finance, and aggregate accruals literatures. i also outline empirical challenges faced by studies investigating bubbles and recommend approaches to further strengthen inferences. finally, i propose opportunities for future research to integrate deeper accounting knowledge into bubble research. © 2024 elsevier b.v."

"debt-financed graduate education refers to the practice of borrowing money to fund postgraduate studies, such as a master’s degree. how undergraduates make graduate student loan decisions is an area of growing policy interest in higher education, but it is nevertheless an understudied area in behavioral finance. in this article, our purpose was to find out whether a financial education intervention aimed at graduate loan decision making leads to an improvement in debt-related choices and, if so, to what extent. in addition, we wish to learn more about the mechanisms through which such causal effects operate. based on a randomized controlled experiment among college seniors, this study shows that the financial education intervention decreased the likelihood of taking on excessive debt through a graduate student loan (i.e., assuming a level of debt higher than that necessary to make a certain economically viable investment). the study also shows that the financial education intervention reduced overconfidence bias (i.e., the tendency for individuals to overestimate their abilities and knowledge). finally, we carry out a causal mediation analysis to investigate the extent to which overconfidence plays a mediating role in the effect of the financial education intervention on debt outcomes.

"in the realm of behavioral finance, the influence of information - particularly that disseminated by media sources - plays a pivotal role in shaping stock market prices. this study categorizes social media into three distinct evolutionary phases, each characterized by its media agency and mode of interaction: authoritative media, grassroots media, and digital interactive media. as we transition into the digital economy era, digital interactive media has emerged as the predominant medium for the dissemination of investment-related information in china. each media type exhibits unique attributes and varying degrees of impact on the stock market. given its voluminous information output and dual-subject nature, there is a pressing need for digital interactive media to refine its research approaches and methodologies through a systematic review of existing literature. this paper conducts an exhaustive review of 53 seminal journal articles that focus on stock price forecasting, encompassing all three major phases of media development. it critically evaluates the current body of research, highlighting the focal points and limitations from three perspectives: the evolution of stock market media, the processing of information on media platforms, and the development of multi-source heterogeneous models. looking forward, the paper advocates for the application of nlp techniques to quantify sentiment and the utilization of multi-source heterogeneous large-scale models.  © 2024 ieee."

"objective: the aim of this research is to analyze the factors that influence small traders' decisions in borrowing money from loan sharks. method: this research uses behavioral planning theory (tpb) as a quantitative analysis framework. results and discussion: the results of data processing show that the financial behavior of small traders is influenced by factors such as ease of loans, disbursement without time constraints, social communication, payment flexibility, and other social dimensions. the research results provide insight into the complex dynamics of small traders' financial behavior and provide a basis for finding relevant and sustainable solutions in increasing fairer financial access at the community level. research implications: this research investigates the financial behavior of small traders who interact with moneylenders in the context of communal finance. amid intense market competition, small traders face financial differentiation, creating complexity in their financial behavior. limited access to finance and the complex role of moneylenders makes it difficult for small traders to manage debt. originality/value: this research can help design better policies to support the economic sustainability of small traders and overcome the financial challenges they face. © 2024 anpad - associacao nacional de pos-graduacao e pesquisa em administracao. all rights reserved."
"pro-environmental intentions encourage individuals to make conscious decisions that help protect the environment, reduce waste, conserve resources, and preserve natural habitats. this study aims to assess the predictive power of environmental concern, perceived behavioral control and social norms in determining the pro-environmental intentions in the theory of planned behavior (tpb) framework. methodologically we rely on structural equation modelling (sem), applied to the survey study among 2,702 university students majoring in economics, finance, management, or marketing from croatia, the czech republic, hungary, poland, slovakia, and spain. the results show that the model explained 51% of the total variance of pro-environmental intentions, with the predictive power of environmental concern and perceived behavioral control at 42% and 45%, respectively, and social norms at only 6% (out of total 51% of explanatory power). the implications of our results suggest a major focus on increasing environmental concern and perceived behavioral control in behavioral interventions to support pro-environmental behavior. the effectiveness of social pressure produced by injunctive social norms proved limited. the cross-country differences were not statistically significant. more research must be done to study the relative effect of injunctive and descriptive social norms on pro-environmental behavior. copyright © 2024 kotyza, cabelkova, pierański, malec, borusiak, smutka, nagy, gawel, bernardo lópez lluch, kis, gál, gálová, mravcová, knezevic and hlaváček."
"although predictive ai models have grown to dominate computational finance, they are often limited in their applications when it comes to studying interventions and explaining behavioral outcomes. financial economics, on the other hand, has a rich history of analytical approaches to asset-pricing theory, often requiring sweeping assumptions. in this paper, we construct an agent-based model of asset markets that is able to dispense with onerous restrictions on agent behaviors and beliefs, while having analytical validity and providing insights into the functioning of asset markets. in particular, we evaluate our models with respect to several traditional financial economic theories like tobin's separation theorem and the capital asset pricing model (capm). we devise a network representing trades to show the emergence of different roles played by the agents. we study interventions, such as shocks, and explain the outcomes using our model. finally, we investigate the effects of noise trading and show that noisy agents converge to different equilibrium points due to their differences in beliefs. put together, this paper presents an agent-based model that can be used to study the effects of heterogeneous beliefs and risks of the agents and shocks to assets at a systemic level, thereby connecting localized agent and asset characteristics to global or collective outcomes. © 2024 international foundation for autonomous agents and multiagent systems."

"one of the most popular and legally recognized behavioral biometrics is the individual's signature, which is used for verification and identification in many different industries, including business, law, and finance. the purpose of the signature verification method is to distinguish genuine from forged signatures, a task complicated by cultural and personal variances. analysis, comparison, and evaluation of handwriting features are performed in forensic handwriting analysis to establish whether or not the writing was produced by a known writer. in contrast to other languages, arabic makes use of diacritics, ligatures, and overlaps that are unique to it. due to the absence of dynamic information in the writing of arabic signatures, it will be more difficult to attain greater verification accuracy. on the other hand, the characteristics of arabic signatures are not very clear and are subject to a great deal of variation (features’ uncertainty). to address this issue, the suggested work offers a novel method of verifying offline arabic signatures that employs two layers of verification, as opposed to the one level employed by prior attempts or the many classifiers based on statistical learning theory. a static set of signature features is used for layer one verification. the output of a neutrosophic logic module is used for layer two verification, with the accuracy depending on the signature characteristics used in the training dataset and on three membership functions that are unique to each signer based on the degree of truthiness, indeterminacy, and falsity of the signature features. the three memberships of the neutrosophic set are more expressive for decision-making than those of the fuzzy sets. the purpose of the developed model is to account for several kinds of uncertainty in describing arabic signatures, including ambiguity, inconsistency, redundancy, and incompleteness. the experimental results show that the verification system works as intended and can successfully reduce the far and frr. © 2024, american scientific publishing group (aspg). all rights reserved."
"this study addresses bangladesh’s unemployment problem and its youth’s limited entrepreneurial aspiration focusing on critical factors that influence entrepreneurial intentions among university students in bangladesh. recognizing universities’ role in fostering entrepreneurship, the study aims to identify these determinants, bridging a gap in literature in the context of bangladesh. built upon an extended theory of planned behavior, the study incorporates ‘access to finance’ and ‘entrepreneurship program’ as mediators. this framework examines the relationships of ‘attitude’, ‘subjective norms’, ‘perceived behavioral control’, ‘entrepreneurship program’, ‘access to finance’, and their collective impact on entrepreneurial intentions. utilizing stratified random sampling, the researchers collected data from 394 students across 23 selected bangladeshi universities offering entrepreneurship programs encompassing faculty of business & entrepreneurship and faculty of science & engineering. the study employed structural equation modeling (sem) for analyzing the data. the findings revealed that there were positive relationships between ‘entrepreneurial intention’ and ‘attitude’, ‘subjective norms’, ‘perceived behavioral control’, ‘entrepreneurship program’, and ‘access to finance’. the findings have practical implications for bangladesh’s government and educational institutes when it comes to promoting entrepreneurship programs extensively. the empirical results clearly demonstrate that the integration of access to finance and practical entrepreneurship programs significantly boosts the entrepreneurial aspirations of university students, encouraging them to pursue entrepreneurship as a career path. this, in turn, contributes to the advancement of economic sustainability in bangladesh. these outcomes are consistent with the overarching aims of sustainable development goal 8, which strives to foster continuous economic growth, generate employment prospects, and ensure decent work opportunities, particularly for the youth. © 2024 the author(s). published by informa uk limited, trading as taylor & francis group."

"the traditional view in finance is that investments must be made using rational processes. before making decisions, investors evaluate both risks and returns to maximize their long-term profits. behavioral finance presents a challenge to traditional finance because it introduces psychological factors that impact their choices. the fluctuations in the price of securities are caused by irrational activity on the part of investors and abnormalities in the market. as a direct result, analyses have been done to investigate the influence of various biases and factors on traders’ decisions. the primary objective of this paper research is to study and analyze the consequences of three biases in it, banking sectors, and academic industry. there are three cognitive biases: overconfidence, optimism, and the illusion of control. a total of 362 people filled out the structured questionnaire, which was utilized to gather data. data analysis involved using smartpls software to apply the pls algorithm and bootstrapping technique in partial least squares structural equation modeling. the research showed that there is a meaningful connection between having an excessive amount of confidence and making financial decisions. at the same time, optimism and the illusion of control did not significantly affect their decisions. although this study provides valuable insights into investor biases in delhi-ncr, it is essential to acknowledge its limited scope. investors may benefit from this study by understanding the factors that influence the market through this research. it will ultimately lead to more rational investment decisions and increase market productivity. © 2024 scrivener publishing llc."

"no-debt smes have potential slack in that they can raise financial resources to face external shocks or explore new business opportunities. this study compares the performance implications of potential slack mobilization during and before the covid-19 context by building on arguments from the behavioral theory of firms and corporate finance. the disruptions caused by the covid-19 crisis theoretically amplify the stabilizing and adaptive functions of potential slack and thus represent an interesting and promising field of investigation. based on a sample of french smes, the empirical results show that the mobilization of potential slack is positively associated with profitability during the covid-19 crisis but not before it. slack mobilization is negatively associated with profitability outside the covid-19 period when smes mobilize important amounts of potential slack. overall, this study sheds light on the process of slack resource mobilization by smes and the central moderating role of the economic environment. © 2023 international council for small business."
"due to swift technological changes and the resultant digital revolution, a wide range of new digital financial products and services have emerged in the financial markets, as witnessed in the context of the fintech sector, the economics of blockchain and nft issuance. this book takes an in-depth look at the challenges faced by individuals who make investment decisions in a rapidly changing financial world and presents a concise and thorough overview of the multifaceted approach to investment and savings behavior. it explores behavioral digital finance, referencing the latest theories in economic psychology and financial markets and provides an analysis of the process of saving and investing in the context of our new digital reality, where an understanding of human-ai interaction and its benefits and threats is extremely important. it combines an accessible overview of classical and new behavioral theories, models of financial decision making as well as an analysis of the new trends in financial decision making. special attention is given to financial decision support systems and the role of financial advice services, which are of growing importance, due to their increasing complexity and difficulty. the book combines theoretical considerations and wide-reaching empirical analyses from a representative sample of international respondents. it deals with the individual approach to human risk-taking, and human-ai interaction and its benefits and threats. the book explores how people react to algorithms, what drives algorithm aversion and appreciation, and how understanding of those mechanisms can be employed to improve financial advisory systems and also considers the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on financial behavior. © 2023 elżbieta kubińska, magdalena adamczyk-kowalczuk and anna macko."
"analysts’ observable careers are short. around half of the analysts we study have observable lives of approximately three years. using the ibes database as a proxy for the length of analysts’ careers, we find that distraction and herding shorten observable lives. there are important roles for economically rational influences. the length of observable careers is reduced by inaccuracy in forecasting. issuing a first forecast early but, on average, delaying forecasts for the portfolio of firms they cover also increase analysts’ life spans. we find no robust association between life span and optimism or overconfidence. © 2022 the institute of behavioral finance."
"we see the stock market constantly responding to changing signals. these inputs are perceived to be highly structured in both space and time. such regularities in the environment allow expectations about the future to be formed, facilitating current investment decisions. perceiving the continuous stability is exploited by the brain, creating a bias in perception to generate serial dependence. therefore, stock price dependence may be simply a result of the behavioral dependence in the decision process. the empirical evidence presented in this paper confirms that the dependence in every facet of an investment decision process has contributed to the observed stock price dependence. the largest contributor is by far from investors’ memory dependence, exceeding 80%. if history is the record of past decisions going through the brain’s neural pathways, the memory dependence or “memory of the memory” occurs when people follow the same old neural pathway over time. as paying attention to history is an obvious mental visit to the memory neural pathways, those who study the history are doomed to repeat it. © 2022 the institute of behavioral finance."
"the general personality traits, notably the big-five personality traits, have been increasingly integrated into recommendation systems. the personality-aware recommendations, which incorporate human personality into recommendation systems, have shown promising results in general recommendation areas including music, movie, and e-commerce recommendations. on the other hand, the number of research delving into the applicability of personality-aware recommendations in specialized domains such as finance and education remains limited. in addition, these domains have unique challenges in incorporating personality-aware recommendations as domain-specific psychological traits such as risk tolerance and behavioral biases play a crucial role in explaining user behavior in these domains. addressing these challenges, this study addresses an in-depth exploration of personality-aware recommendations in the financial domain, specifically within the context of stock recommendations. first, this study investigates the benefits of deploying general personality traits in stock recommendations through the integration of personality-aware recommendations with user-based collaborative filtering approaches. second, this study further verifies whether incorporating domain-specific psychological traits along with general personality traits enhances the performance of stock recommender systems. thirdly, this paper introduces a personalized stock recommendation model that incorporates both general personality traits and domain-specific psychological traits as well as transaction data. the experimental results show that the proposed model outperformed baseline models in financial stock recommendations. © the author(s) 2024."
"in many important real-world decision domains, such as finance, the environment, and health, behavior is strongly influenced by experience. renewed interest in studying this influence led to important advancements in the understanding of these decisions from experience (dfe) in the last 20 years. building on this literature, we suggest ways the standard experimental design should be extended to better approach important real-world dfe. these extensions include, for example, introducing more complex choice situations, delaying feedback, and including social interactions. when acting upon experiences in these richer and more complicated environments, extensive cognitive processes go into making a decision. therefore, we argue for integrating cognitive processes more explicitly into experimental research in dfe. these cognitive processes include attention to and perception of numeric and nonnumeric experiences, the influence of episodic and semantic memory, and the mental models involved in learning processes. understanding these basic cognitive processes can advance the modeling, understanding and prediction of dfe in the laboratory and in the real world. we highlight the potential of experimental research in dfe for theory integration across the behavioral, decision, and cognitive sciences. furthermore, this research could lead to new methodology that better informs decision-making and policy interventions. © the author(s) 2023."
"this paper firstly studies the regional economic law under the perspective of blockchain, using the characteristics of blockchain as a regulatory system outside the bottom layer, but also needs to combine the application scenario of supply chain finance and build a financial and economic regulatory system and a heterogeneous multi-chain cooperative regulatory system. secondly, in response to the problems such as the irrationality of regional economic law, the price discrimination antitrust litigation system is proposed to play the role of economic recovery. then the digital currency economic law is studied by using an adaptive differential evolutionary algorithm, using the process of crossover, variation, and selection to obtain digital currency behavioral characteristics so as to ensure the digital currency economic visualization analysis and to plan the monetary policy of economic law and analyze the digital currency economic risk. the results show that bitcoin’s daily average right-tail var (94.8%) is the lowest among the listed crypto-digital currencies at 2.58%, while the left-tail mean is the highest among the three crypto-digital currencies, which is consistent with the fact that btc has been issued for the longest time and is more mature among the crypto-digital currencies with the most dramatic tail risk variation as well as the largest magnitude. © 2023 lihong huang, published by sciendo."
"purpose: the purpose of this paper is to investigate the process by which the level of immersion in virtual reality-based behavioral simulation (vr-bs) impacts on the non-cognitive and cognitive outcomes. the cognitive outcome is measured using the increase in the level of sharia financial literacy, while the noncognitive outcome is measured using the behavioral intention to use vr-bs. design/methodology/approach: the method consists of two parts: first, the development of vr-bs, in the context of sharia financial literacy, using the waterfall model. second, testing the effectiveness of vr-bs using the theory of interactive media effects framework. the participants were 142 students from three secondary schools (two islamic religious schools and one public school) in yogyakarta and central java, indonesia. partial least squares structural equation modeling was used for testing the hypotheses. findings: vr-bs creates a perceived coolness and vividness, which in turn has an impact on increasing the participants’ engagement. also, the use of vr has an impact on natural mapping, which increases a user’s engagement through its perceived ease of use. as predicted, the user’s engagement affects vr’s behavior, mediated by the user’s attitude toward vr media. vr’s interactivity, however, does not impact on the cognitive aspect. research limitations/implications: the participants were not randomly selected, as the data were collected during the covid-19 pandemic. as a result, the majority of the participants had never tried vr before this study. the participants, however, were digital natives. practical implications: it is implied from the findings that islamic financial business actors and the relevant government agencies (e.g. the indonesian financial services authority [ojk], the ministry of education, culture, research and technology and the ministry of religious affairs) should collaborate to best prepare the future generation of ummah by using vr-bs in their joint promotion and education programs. the results of the current study reveal that the use of vr-bs may attract people to engage in islamic financial activities. by engaging in such activities, or at least engaging in real-life simulations/classes/workshops, people may gradually acquire more knowledge about islamic finance. originality/value: as predicted, the user’s engagement has an impact on behavior toward vr-bs, which is mediated by attitude toward vr-bs. © 2024, emerald publishing limited."
"purpose: islamic home financing products with murabaha contracts are widely favored among the muslim community in indonesia, given that the country has a population of over 230 million muslims. to facilitate the development of products and enhance public interest, it is important for islamic banking institutions to comprehend the elements that may impact the intents of muslim communities in indonesia when selecting islamic home financing products with murabaha contracts. the purpose of this study is to ascertain the many aspects that may have an impact on the decision-making process of muslim communities in indonesia when selecting islamic home financing product that use murabaha contracts. design/methodology/approach: the partial least square-structural equation modeling data processing techniques will be used to process and evaluate these components. the data used in this study was acquired by administering questionnaires to a sample of 298 muslim communities, which were randomly selected from a pool of 301 possible customers of islamic house finance in indonesia. findings: the results of this research show that attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control have positive influence on intention to choose an islamic home financing scheme with murabaha agreement, while price fairness of islamic home financing and islamic altruism have direct and indirect influence on intention to choose islamic home financing. research limitations/implications: analyzing factors that affect intention to choose islamic home financing product under murabaha contract is essential. future study is required to analyze other islamic home financing products, such as istisna, ijarah muntahia bi tamlik and diminishing musharakah. this study only serves as a foundation for further investigations into conventional approaches to home financing in emerging nations. the areas can be expanded to be implemented in other countries. practical implications: it is anticipated that islamic banks have the capacity to cultivate a favorable and constructive perception, hence fostering a positive disposition among the muslim populace in indonesia. furthermore, it is essential for islamic banks to guarantee that all stakeholders within the sharia-compliant institution, particularly the frontline staff, have enough expertise and understanding of the intricacies of islamic home financing products including murabaha contracts, which are intended for prospective customers. in the foreseeable future, it is anticipated that the muslim population in indonesia would exhibit a greater intention toward the use of islamic home financing solutions that use murabaha contracts, facilitated by the establishment of a conducive environment. originality/value: this research integrates the impacts of pricing fairness and islamic charity as a modified model, alongside the theory of planned behavior model, to examine the influence of these factors on individuals’ intentions to use islamic home financing in indonesia. © 2024, emerald publishing limited."

"frequent price manipulation in the bitcoin market will lead to market risk and seriously disrupt the financial order, but there is less research on its regulation. we address the bitcoin price manipulation problem by building a regulatory game model. first, we study the price manipulation mechanism of the bitcoin market based on behavioral finance and clarify the boundary conditions. second, we introduce regulator constraints and establish a game model between the manipulator and the regulator. further, through variable deconstruction, parameter verification, and simulation analysis, we explore how to achieve effective regulation of bitcoin price manipulation. we find that the effective regulation of bitcoin price manipulation can be achieved in three ways: (1) adjust the penalty coefficient with a certain lower threshold so that the manipulator's expected return is negative; (2) set the lowest possible price fluctuation standard while ensuring that it does not interfere with market-based transactions; (3) the simulation of price manipulation regulation is optimized and most efficiently controlled when the probability of investigation is dynamically adjusted by a concave function on the price fluctuation standard.  © 2020 tsinghua university press."
"an array of software apps, from fitness to finance, enrolls behavioral economics, and economists, in their product designs, value propositions, or else sales pitches, to make products more engaging and to afford users new capabilities in their daily lives. drawing on 30 interviews with product strategists, designers, and user researchers who work on these self-styled ‘behavior change apps,’ this paper empirically studies the behavioral economic proposition and its operationalization in routine practices of software development and design. setting aside the behavioral addiction and manipulation frame that critical work on app design typically summons, i approach behavioral economics applications as market work and tease out the different, co-existing logics of attachment between products and their users, that emerge from how market actors decide what product to build, which features to have and how to design the user experience. in doing so, i show that strictly focusing on the frequency of repeated interaction is also empirically inadequate. the product is rather strategized, developed, and designed to become something that the user ‘cannot do without,’ not because it is addictive, but because it is made indispensable to the distributed action universe of the behavioral problem that it addresses. © 2023 the author(s). published by informa uk limited, trading as taylor & francis group on behalf of academy of criminal justice sciences."
"despite many revolutionary asset pricing models developed over the past decades, traditional finance does not explain investor behavior very well. the purpose of this study is to examine the influence of behavioral biases on the investment decisions of investors of pakistan stock exchange. in addition, the moderating influence of investment experience investigated in this study. the findings were reported using a sample of 230 individual investors, who make their own investments, typically through a mutual fund, bank, or internet broker. they make investments to achieve their unique investment objectives, such as saving for retirement, a child’s education, or increasing their overall wealth. the influence of behavioral biases on investment decisions was calculated using regression analysis. regression results show that beta and t-values are significant and have a significant impact on investment decisions. regression findings show that confirmation bias, gamblers fallacy bias, negativity bias, bandwagon effect bias, loss aversion bias, and overconfidence bias all have a substantial impact on investment decisions. status quo prejudice and endowment bias have a favorable but minor influence on investment decisions. investment experience is regarded as an essential component that contributes to successful decision making under risk and uncertainty, however the results of this study show that moderating variables have a minor influence. according to the findings, the moderating variable had no effect on the connection between behavioral biases and investment decisions. and the reason for this is that behavioral biases persist regardless of investing experience. © saima aziz, shahid mehmood, muhammad asif khan, anita tangl, 2024."
"an important but understudied factor influencing strategic decisions of farmers is policy uncertainty. increased policy uncertainty may expedite the timing of investments in expansion, a phenomenon that has been observed in the dutch dairy sector in recent years. using a participatory bayesian network, we aimed to identify and assess the farm, farmer, and environmental characteristics that explain and predict investment strategies. the variable policy uncertainty is modeled as a multidimensional concept that is a function of objective and subjective variables. we found that the most important variables influencing investment timing are succession, risk attitude, perceived policy uncertainty, and earning capacity. the insights derived from this study are useful for policy advisors, finance providers, farm advisors, and also farmers themselves to enhance their understanding of why and when farm investments are likely to occur despite the high level of policy uncertainty.

"purpose: this study investigates the relationship between the individual’s levels of innovativeness (ili) and the individual’s intention to finance (iif) an equity crowdfunding campaign to understand whether and to what extent individuals' personalities (ip) can foster crowdfunding success. design/methodology/approach: ols models are applied based on survey data collected from 385 us and uk citizen respondents. further, the baseline relationship between ili and iif is broken down on the basis of the interactions with two behavioral characteristics: proactive personality (pp) and openness to experience (oe). findings: results show a positive relationship between individual’s levels of innovativeness and the individual’s intention to finance an equity crowdfunding campaign. furthermore, this relationship continues to be positive when moderators are introduced in the models, demonstrating that pp and oe are personal traits that strengthen the main relationship. originality/value: our findings contribute to enriching the stream of literature according to which equity crowdfunding is a helpful tool not only able to bridge the financial gap of companies during the first phase of their life cycle. the findings also contribute to the development of the innovation process, creating also a social identity within the crowdfunding community. © 2024, emerald publishing limited."
"this paper proposes a tractable way to model boundedly rational dynamic programming. the agent uses an endogenously simplified, or ""sparse,""model of the world and the consequences of his actions and acts according to a behavioral bellman equation. the framework yields a behavioral version of some of the canonical models in macroeconomics and finance. in the life-cycle model, the agent initially does not pay much attention to retirement and undersaves; late in life, he progressively saves more, generating realistic dynamics. in the consumption-savings model, the consumer decides to pay little or no attention to the interest rate and more attention to his income. ricardian equivalence and the lucas critique partially fail because the consumer may not pay full attention to taxes and policy changes. in a merton-style dynamic portfolio choice problem, the agent endogenously pays limited or no attention to the varying equity premium and hedging demand terms. finally, in the neoclassical growth model, agents act on a simplified model of the macroeconomy; in equilibrium, fluctuations are larger and more persistent.  © 2023 the author(s). published by oxford university press on behalf of european economic association."
"the global life expectancy rate has increased over time, with china being no exception to this trend. the convergence of a growing elderly population heightened strain on the pension fund system, and inadequate savings represents a considerable obstacle to financial stability. addressing this challenge requires initiatives to enhance retirement planning and promote individuals’ financial well-being. consequently, given the challenges above, high-quality financial planning for retirement (fpr) has emerged as a crucial factor for successful aging, underscoring the need for additional research in this area. despite abundant research on retirement planning, the emergence of behavioral finance and the incorporation of psychological principles into fpr has heightened its significance. resultantly, there is a growing need to explore this phenomenon further. it is necessary to examine which psychological factors lead to insufficient savings by individuals. the present study aims to assess the psychological factors influencing individuals’ fpr, expanding the explanatory models for retirement savings decisions and behaviors. using the capacity-willingness-opportunity (cwo) model and supported by image theory and the 3m model, this study focuses on the interaction between future time perspective, retirement goal clarity, risk tolerance, subjective financial literacy, and objective financial literacy as psychological characteristics influence individuals’ fpr. back translation was used to examine the accuracy of the preliminary translation of research instruments to obtain meaningful results. this translation method was combined with the pretest method of expert reviews and cognitive interviews to increase the survey questionnaire’s validity. a purposive sampling technique was applied to collect data from adults over 23 years old and with a certain income stream in six cities in china. structural equation modeling (sem) will examine the hypotheses of direct and mediating effects. the findings will offer implications for financial market regulators, policymakers, and consumers. © the author(s), under exclusive license to springer nature switzerland ag 2024."

"financial outlets are branches or business outlets of financial institutions such as banks, investment and finance companies and insurance companies in cities, which are used to provide a variety of financial services and businesses. the location of financial outlets is usually determined on the basis of factors such as population density, commercial areas, residential areas and transportation convenience. as an important carrier of urban financial services, the rationality of the layout of financial outlets can reflect the financial needs and behavioral patterns of people in the city. urban functional area is a product after urbanization, different from urban land use type which focuses on the classification of urban land use through natural conditions, urban functional area mainly analyzes the internal spatial structure of the city, focusing on the discernment of the dominant functions within the built-up area of the city. by categorizing urban functions such as residence, commercial service and industry, the spatial distribution of urban functions can be grasped to provide support for urban planning and development. urban functional areas can reveal human behavior patterns, needs and preferences in different areas. the current research on financial outlets mainly focuses on the accessibility and coverage of financial outlets, and researchers treat financial outlets as spatially undifferentiated points, ignoring the problem of spatial heterogeneity of financial outlets within different functional zones. when studying the rationality of the layout of urban financial outlets, considering different functional zones within the city can better meet the financial needs of residents, enterprises and institutions in the region and improve the accessibility and convenience of financial services. analyzing the comprehensive service capacity of financial outlets within different functional areas is obviously insufficient in the current study, which is not conducive to the configuration planning of financial outlets and the promotion of the accessibility of urban financial services. the wide application of point of interest (poi) data in spatial analysis provides a new perspective for the study of urban financial outlets, for this reason, this paper analyzes and researches the current situation and rationality of the spatial layout of financial outlets based on poi data, under the perspective of the functional areas of the city, and combined with the population travel vitality index. the term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) algorithm is used to process the poi data to generate the urban functional area, on the basis of which the travel vitality index in the city is calculated by combining the population coverage and road network density, so as to judge the reasonableness of the layout of urban financial outlets. this helps us to better understand the behavioral decision-making process and social interaction of human beings about financial life in the city, and provides guidance and decision-making support for urban financial layout planning, financial public services and financial policies. © author(s) 2023."
"purpose: this study aims to assess the impact of personality traits, risk perception and perceived coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) disruption on the investment behavior of individual investors in the indian stock market. design/methodology/approach: this study adopts a survey approach. the sample comprises 315 active retail investors investing in the indian stock exchange. two-stage analysis technique regression and artificial neural network (ann) were used for data analysis. study hypotheses were tested through regression and ann was adopted to validate the regression results. findings: two regression models were modeled to test the research hypotheses. findings showed that risk perception and covid-19 disruption have a significant positive and neuroticism has a significant negative impact on short-term investment decisions, while the role of conscientiousness in determining short-term investment decisions was not found significant. results also showed a positive impact of neuroticism and conscientiousness and a negative impact of risk perception on long-term investment decisions. the role of covid-19 disruption was found negative but insignificant in predicting long-term investment decisions. practical implications: this study has practical implications for many parties like retail investors, financial advisors and policymakers. this study will assist the investors to realize that they do not always take rational financial decisions. this study will suggest the financial advisors to use the knowledge of behavioral finance in making the advisors' advisory and wealth management decisions. this study will also assist the policymakers to outline behaviorally well-informed policy decisions to protect the interests of investors. originality/value: india is one of the fast-growing economies in the world. india has a vast population of active investors and determining investors' investment behavior adds novelty to this study as developed economies have remained the main focus of previous studies. the other novel feature of this study is that this study tries to assess the impact of covid-19 disruption along with personality traits and risk perception on investment behavior. the other valuable factor of this study is the use of ann to predict the relative importance of the exogenous variables. © 2023, emerald publishing limited."
"this paper provides evidence of confirmation bias by sell-side analysts in their earnings forecasts. we show that analysts tend to put higher weight on public information when the current forecast consensus is more consistent with their previous forecasts. we further find that analysts with better past forecasting performance, longer firm-specific experience, or forecasting earlier, tend to be more subject to confirmation bias, consistent with some of the existing cognitive and social psychology theories. the results remain significant after controlling for analyst incentives. finally, we distinguish evidence of confirmation bias from that of other important behavioral biases such as conservative bias. © 2022 the institute of behavioral finance."
"the convergence of behavioral finance and artificial intelligence (ai) has attracted substantial attention in recent years, representing a dynamic amalgamation of insights stemming from psychology and economics with state-of-the-art technology. ai's prowess extends to bias detection, wherein it meticulously examines patterns in investment decisions. it adeptly identifies prevalent biases like loss aversion and overconfidence by contrasting responses to losses and gains. furthermore, ai plays a crucial role in uncovering biases related to social and ethical considerations, such as ethnoracial equity, and aids in identifying and mitigating biases within ai models themselves. cutting-edge frameworks, crowdsourced failure reports, bias auditing tools, and psychophysics-inspired methodologies all contribute to the comprehensive detection of biases. in summary, the synergy between behavioral finance and ai revolutionizes our comprehension of financial decision-making. © 2024, igi global. all rights reserved."
"the purpose of the present study was to empirically examine the efficacy of statutory disclosures in the indian mutual fund industry. whether the disclaimers aid investors in their decision-making process was investigated. the study made a distinction between type of investors (novice and seasoned investors) as disclaimers affect differently on investor’s belief, attitude and ability to take informed decision. survey was conducted using a structured questionnaire to evaluate the responses of 388 investors, consisting of 243 novice and 145 seasoned investors. data was analyzed using mean comparison, independent t-test, and logistic regression model. results revealed that statutory disclaimers were less effective on seasoned investors compared to novice investors. this suggests seasoned investors process the disclaimer information differently. novice investors systematically process the disclaimers of mutual fund advertising, and their investment decision was meaningfully affected by the disclaimers. the study offers specific suggestions for stakeholders working in the area of behavioral finance, highlighting the importance of considering the dual process theory of information processing. to the best of authors knowledge, this study is the first of its kind to evaluate the efficacy of mandatory disclaimers in the indian mutual fund industry, providing unique insights for future research in the field. © 2023 kj somaiya institute of management."
"firms play a vital role in the transition towards a circular economy (ce). however, the number of firms imple-menting ce initiatives, or circular business models (cbms—economic models based on ce principles), is cur-rently small. in light of this, this study quantitatively assesses the critical factors that influence firms' intentions to adopt cbms, with the theories of planned behavior and the resource-based view providing the theoretical background. we applied the pls-sem to 321 firms and found that attitude and perceived behavioral control of firm owners/managers, as well as long-term orientation and social pressure of firms, significantly influence the intention to adopt cbms, with perceived behavioral control emerging as the most influential factor. the findings also confirm that finance and knowledge have a crucial influence on firm owners'/managers' perceptions of the conditions necessary to undertake cbms. overall, then, the study provides sound policy implications and scholarly evidence to fill the relevant research gap, and in so doing contributes to ensuring a better transition towards a ce. © 2023, university of economics and human sciences in warsaw. all rights reserved."
"work experiences, conceptualized as work attitudes, influence employees’ turnover and performance. therefore, it is essential for investment banks to understand the determinants of traders’ work experience. analyzing traders’ reviews of major investment banks, this study shows that traders’ attitudes depend on the banks’ culture, traders’ career opportunities, and, to a lesser extent, their pay perceptions. furthermore, traders are often happy with their coworkers but dissatisfied with their banks’ technology, bureaucracy, ethics, and their work-life balance. hence, this study identifies non-monetary determinants of traders’ work attitudes, extends behavioral finance research, and offers applications for investment banks as well as their shareholders. © 2022 the author(s). published with license by taylor & francis group, llc."
"purpose: investment decisions hold immense significance for investors and eventually affect their portfolio performance. investors are advised to weigh the costs and benefits associated with every decision in order to make rational investment decisions. however, behavioral finance research reveals that investors' choices often stem from a blend of economic, psychological and sociological factors, leading to irrationality. moreover, environmental, social and corporate governance (esg) factors, aligned with behavioral finance hypotheses, also sway opinions and stock prices. hence, this study aims to identify how individual equity investors prioritize key determinants of investment decisions in the indian stock market. design/methodology/approach: the current research gathered data from 391 individual equity investors through a structured questionnaire. thereafter, a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (f-ahp) was used to meet the purpose of the research. findings: information availability, representative heuristics belonging to psychological factors and macroeconomic indicators falling under economic factors were discovered to be the three most prioritized criteria, whereas environmental issues within the realm of esg factors, recommendations of brokers or investment consultants of sociological factors, and social issues belonging to esg factors were found to be the least prioritized criteria, respectively. research limitations/implications: only active and experienced individual equity investors were surveyed in this study. furthermore, with a sample size of 391 participants, the study was confined to individual equity investors in one nation, india. practical implications: this research has implications for individual investors, institutional investors, market regulators, corporations, financial advisors, portfolio managers, policymakers and society as a whole. originality/value: to the best of the authors' knowledge, no real attempt has been made to comprehend how active and experienced individual investors prioritize critical determinants of investment decisions by taking economic, psychological, sociological and esg factors collectively under consideration. © 2023, emerald publishing limited."
"word-of-mouth (wom) is a socially embedded process, and investors engage in social considerations to achieve self-motives. investors attempt to share negative wom (nwom) to emotionally connect (self-affirm) to strengthen existing social ties following prior losses. in contrast, investors attempt to share positive wom (pwom) to self-enhance to attract others into developing new social ties. thereby, this study aims to predict the impact of prior losses or gains on investors’ later decisions by engaging in the valence of wom to achieve different underlying self-motives and social-motives. this study used experimental data and employed process tool model 6 to check the validity of the proposed triple serial mediation model. findings support the viability of the triple mediation model that investors seek to achieve different underlying self-motives and social-motives manifested in pwom or nwom, following prior gains or losses. investors seek to self-affirm by strengthening components of social-motives through engaging in nwom, following prior losses. while investors seek to self-enhance to develop components of social-motives through sharing pwom, following prior gains. findings provide significant implications for researchers, managers, financial advisors, and analysts. researchers, managers, and analysts can incorporate investors’ intrinsic factors in traditional economic models to better predict investors’ economic behavior. financial advisors need to understand self-motives and social-motives that change clients’ risk attitude and frame investment advice to achieve particular clients’ self-motives and social-motives. © 2023 the institute of behavioral finance."
"behavioral finance research has shown that in ipo market, both the stock name and the stock code can affect investors' judgement of the value of a stock, thus causing significant ipo price anomalies. however, no study has examined the possible impact of the end-word tones of the stock names on investors' cognitive biases and their consequences in the chinese ipo market. the results of this paper show that, firstly, the average price-to-earnings (p/e) ratios of stocks with easy pronunciation of the end-word tones in their names (easy-pronunciation stocks) are consistently higher than those of stocks with difficult pronunciation (difficult-pronunciation stocks), both on the first day of the ipo and about six months after the ipo. secondly, on the first day of the ipo, easy-pronunciation stocks have higher abnormal returns than those of difficult-pronunciation stocks, but in the following 12 months, the cumulative abnormal returns of easy-pronunciation stocks decreases more than those of the difficult-pronunciation stocks. finally, the effects of end-word tone on both p/e ratios and abnormal returns of ipo stocks in china are generally significant through the first day of the ipo to the following 12 months, but these effects change from positive to negative about six months after the ipo day. © 2023 elsevier inc."
"from the aspect of behavioral finance, which is an emerging area integrating human behavior into finance, this work studies a robust portfolio problem for loss-averse investors under distribution and mean return ambiguity. a loss-aversion distributionally-robust optimization model is constructed if the return distribution of risky assets is unknown. then, under the premise that the mean returns of risky assets belong to an ellipsoidal uncertainty set, a model under joint ambiguity in distribution and mean returns is constructed. this study solves both robust models and derives their analytical solutions, respectively. moreover, the effect of ambiguity aversion and loss aversion on robust optimal portfolio returns is studied. the results show that ambiguity-neutral investors who do not know the return distribution obtain more robust optimal portfolio returns than ambiguity-averse investors who are unaware of both the distribution and mean return. the difference between them decreases with the increase of loss aversion coefficients and increases with ambiguity aversion coefficients. both loss aversion and ambiguity aversion play important roles in investors' behavioral portfolio selection.  © 2014 ieee."
"this study analyzes the relationship between the psychological price barrier of investors and the phenomenon of short-term return reversal in the korean stock market. the short-term return reversal phenomenon is an unexplained anomaly in finance. it is usually measured using returns from one month ago. jegadeesh (1990) and lehmann (1990)www.earticle.net suggest that short-term return reversal may occur due to factors like illiquidity or investors' overreactions. behavioral finance posits that individual investors are irrational and tend to overreact to private information. kahneman and tversky (1979) introduce the concept of the anchor effect, wherein investors rely on reference points for decision-making, similar to a ship anchored and unable to move beyond the length of its anchor line. in the context of behavioral finance, the 52-week highest price serves as a reference point, inducing irrational behavior among investors. investors treat the 52-week highest price as a psychological barrier, and when stock prices approach this level, they become excessively pessimistic about the asset's prospects. on the other hand, when stock prices are distant from the 52-week highest price, investors tend to hold optimistic views, anticipating that the asset's price will rise. we believe that the psychological price barrier influences investor trading behavior and has a significant impact from a liquidity supply perspective. therefore, this study builds on prior research to investigate how investor trading behavior and overreactions affect short-term return reversal. it hypothesizes that the 52-week highest price acts as a psychological price barrier, leading to specific expectations. investors tend to be overly pessimistic about stocks trading near this barrier, hesitating to purchase them. the overreactions of these pessimistic investors do not significantly impact stock returns. in contrast, when stock prices deviate from the 52-week highest price, investors become optimistic, anticipating potential price increases, leading to temporarily overvalued stocks with lower future returns. the study employs common stocks listed on the korea exchange (krx) and the kosdaq market from january 2000 to june 2022, with research data obtained from dataguide. the analysis period starts in january 2000, considering that investor-specific net purchase quantity data is available from january 1999. we conduct empirical analysis using double-sorted portfolio analysis, fama and macbeth cross-sectional regression analysis, and triple-sorted portfolio analysis. we use the inverse of the 52-week highest price as the psychological price barrier and consider it based on the month t-1. the reason for using the t-1 month's psychological price barrier is to alleviate concerns that it might have similar effects to short-term return reversal. also, it's assumed that there is a one-month lag for information about the psychological price barrier to flow into the market and influence investor behavior. short-term return reversal represents the stock returns in month t. the main findings are as follows: first, the 52-week high's psychological price barrier significantly influences short-term return reversal. the further stock prices are from this barrier, the more pronounced the short-term return reversal becomes. conversely, when stock prices are close to the 52-week high, the influence of short-term return reversal diminishes. this indicates that the psychological price barrier alters investor trading behavior, leading to overreactions and short-term return reversal. second, utilizing cross-sectional regression analysis, the study controls for firm-specific factors and reaffirms the impact of the psychological price barrier on stock returns and short-term return reversal. stocks positioned far from the psychological price barrier exhibit a strong and significant short-term return reversal effect. www.earticle.net additionally, the interaction of psychological price variables and previous month returns shows a significant negative predictive power on stock returns. third, the study investigates factors that enhance the relationship between the psychological price barrier and short-term return reversal. prior research highlights that idiosyncratic volatility, lottery-like stocks, and unrealized capital gains overhang play a crucial role in this relationship. triple-sorted portfolio analysis shows that stocks with idiosyncratic volatility, lottery-like stocks, and unrealized capital losses demonstrate more pronounced changes in investor trading behavior due to the psychological price barrier. this results in a significant short-term return reversal effect due to investor overreactions. in conclusion, the research emphasizes how the psychological price barrier influences investor trading behavior and contributes to short-term return reversal in the korean stock market. this sheds light on the impact of investor irrationality on the anomaly of short-term return reversal, offering valuable insights for related fields. © 2023, korean finance association. all rights reserved."
"purpose: behavioral finance and market microstructure studies suggest that the investor sentiment and liquidity are related. this paper aims to examine the aggregate sentiment–liquidity relationship in emerging markets (ems) for both the sample period and crisis period. then, it verifies this relationship, using the asymmetric sentiment. design/methodology/approach: this study uses a sample consisting of stocks listed on the sse shanghai composite index (348 stocks), the jkse (118 stocks), the ipc (14 stocks), the rts (12 stocks), the wse (106 stocks) and ftse/jse africa (76 stocks). this is for the period ranging from february, 2002 until march, 2021 (230 monthly observations). we use the panel data and apply generalized method-of-moments (gmm) of dynamic panel estimators. findings: the empirical analysis shows the following results: first, it demonstrates a significant relationship between the aggregate investor sentiment and the stock market liquidity for the sample period and crisis one. second, referring to the asymmetric sentiment, we have empirically given proof that the market is significantly more liquid in times of the optimistic sentiment than it is in times of the pessimistic sentiment. third, using panel causality tests, we document a unidirectional causality between the investor sentiment and liquidity in a direct manner through the noise traders and the irrational market makers and also a bidirectional causality in an indirect channel. practical implications: the results reported in this paper have implications for regulators and investors in ems. firstly, the study informs the regulators that the increases and decreases in the stock market liquidity are related to the investor sentiment, not financial shocks. we empirically evince that the traded value is higher in the crisis. secondly, we inform insider traders and rational market makers that the persistence of increases in the trading activity in both quiet and turbulent times is associated with investor participants such as noise traders and irrational market makers. originality/value: the originality of this work lies in employing the asymmetric sentiment (optimistic/pessimistic) in order to denote the sentiment–liquidity relationship in ems for the sample period and the 2007–2008 subprime crisis. © 2021, emerald publishing limited."
"stock prediction is a challenging task due to multiple influencing factors and complex market dependencies. traditional solutions are based on a single type of information. with the success of multi-source information in different fields, the combination of different types of information such as numerical and textual information has become a promising option.although multi-source information provides rich multi-view information, how to mine and construct structured relationships from them is a difficult problem. specifically, most existing methods usually extract features from commonly used multi-source information as predictive information sources, without further pre-constructing stock relationship graphs with dependencies using broader information. more importantly, they typically treat each stock as an isolated forecasting, or employ stock market correlations based on a fixed predefined graph structure, but current methods are not sensitive enough to aggregate the attribute features extracted from multi-source information and stock relationship graph, to obtain the dynamic update of market relations and relationship strength. the stock market is highly temporally, and the attributes of nodes are affected by the time perception of other attributes, which is not fully considered.to address these problems, we propose a novel dynamic attributes-driven graph attention networks incorporating sentiment (dgats) information, transaction data, and text data. inspired by behavioral finance, we separately extract sentiment information as a factor of technical indicators, and further realize the early fusion of technical indicators and textual data through kronecker product-based tensor fusion. in particular, by lstm and temporal attention network, the short-term and long-term transition features are gradually grasped from the local composition of the fused stock trading sequence. furthermore, real-time intra-market dependencies and key attributes information are captured with graph networks, enabling dynamic updates of relationships and relationship strengths in predefined graphs. experiments on the real datasets show that the architecture can outperform the previous methods in prediction performance. © 2023 copyright held by the owner/author(s). publication rights licensed to acm."

"purpose: the purpose of this paper is to investigate whether market conditions have an effect on investors’ propensity to herd in an emerging economy’s stock market. additionally, given the lack of research on islamic behavioral finance, the authors further investigate if the herding phenomenon is distinct in islamic versus conventional stocks. design/methodology/approach: the authors used daily data for the period of 1995–2016 according to the herding behavior model of chang et al. (2000), which relies on cross-sectional absolute deviation of returns. findings: findings reveal the herding behavior of investors among shariah-compliant during up and down market exits with non-linear relationship to the market return, while for conventional stocks herding behavior does not exist with linear nor nonlinear relationships during the up and down market. furthermore, for the whole market, herding behavior only exists during upmarket with a nonlinear relationship to the market return. however, this relationship is not significant. moreover, the results of this study are robust with respect to the effect of the asian and global financial crisis. practical implications: the findings are useful for investors to identify which market conditions are associated with rational and irrational behavior of investors. originality/value: most of the theoretical and empirical studies on herding behavior have focused on developed countries. only a few studies have paid attention to the herding behavior in islamic financial markets, particularly in the context of an emerging market such as malaysia. this study fills this void. © 2021, abdollah ah mand, hawati janor, ruzita abdul rahim and tamat sarmidi."
"purpose: this paper applies a volume-price probability wave differential equation to propose a conceptual theory and has innovative behavioral interpretations of intraday dynamic market equilibrium price, in which traders' momentum, reversal and interactive behaviors play roles. design/methodology/approach: the authors select intraday cumulative trading volume distribution over price as revealed preferences. an equilibrium price is a price at which the corresponding cumulative trading volume achieves the maximum value. based on the existence of the equilibrium in social finance, the authors propose a testable interacting traders' preference hypothesis without imposing the invariance criterion of rational choices. interactively coherent preferences signify the choices subject to interactive invariance over price. findings: the authors find that interactive trading choices generate a constant frequency over price and intraday dynamic market equilibrium in a tug-of-war between momentum and reversal traders. the authors explain the market equilibrium through interactive, momentum and reversal traders. the intelligent interactive trading preferences are coherent and account for local dynamic market equilibrium, holistic dynamic market disequilibrium and the nonlinear and non-monotone v-shaped probability of selling over profit (bh curves). research limitations/implications: the authors will understand investors' behaviors and dynamic markets through more empirical execution in the future, suggesting a unified theory available in social finance. practical implications: the authors can apply the subjects' intelligent behaviors to artificial intelligence (ai), deep learning and financial technology. social implications: understanding the behavior of interacting individuals or units will help social risk management beyond the frontiers of the financial market, such as governance in an organization, social violence in a country and covid-19 pandemics worldwide. originality/value: it uncovers subjects' intelligent interactively trading behaviors. © 2022, emerald publishing limited."
"fraud not only damages the wealth and reputation of individuals, but also poses a threat to social security. although the relationship between financial literacy and resident fraud victimization has been discussed in recent studies, previous research has ignored the ways in which residents make psychological decisions when faced with fraud, and findings have not been agreed upon. the purpose of this study is whether and how financial literacy influences fraud victimization in the risky decision-making process. under dual process theories, this study constructs regression models using the survey sample (n = 16352) from the china household finance survey (chfs). our findings show that there is a u-shaped relationship between financial literacy and fraud victimization, and that this relationship is heterogeneous across gender. further analysis found a moderating effect of subjective risk attitudes (sra) on this relationship, with risk preferences causing the u-shaped relationship between financial literacy and resident fraud victimization to gradually shift to a monotonic positive relationship. in addition, we consider the problem of endogeneity, which has been neglected in previous studies, and construct a new instrumental variable to address endogeneity. our study provides some new insights into the behavioral analysis of residents' economic decisions. © 2023 elsevier ltd"
": the authors examined whether stocks with higher left-tail risk measures earn higher or lower futures returns. specifically, the authors estimate the cross-sectional principal component of a battery of left-tail risk measures and analyze future returns on stocks with high principal component values. in contrast to finance theories on the risk–return trade-off relationship, the study results show that high left-tail risk stocks have lower future returns. this finding is robust to various left-tail risk measures and controls for other risk factors. moreover, the negative relationship between the left-tail risk and returns is more pronounced for stocks that are actively traded by retail investors. this empirical result is consistent with behavioral theory that when investors make decisions based on experience, they tend to underweight the likelihood of rare events. © 2023, jungmu kim, yuen jung park and thuy thi thu truong."

"reliable forecasting of the crude oil price has important implications for production planning, investment decisions and policy making. though the effectiveness of denoising hybrid models in crude oil price forecasting has been widely demonstrated, we argue that the denoised series used for model fitting may be affected by the out-of-sample information due to the one-time denoising operation applied to the entire price series. to verify whether the denoising paradigm does improve the crude oil price forecasting, a rolling window mechanism is introduced into two denoising hybrid models based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (eemd) and variational mode decomposition (vmd). the novel r-eemd-rvfl and r-vmd-rvfl models with the random vector functional link (rvfl) neural network are proposed. then, both monthly and weekly west texas intermediate crude oil spot prices are used for multi-step-forward prediction. the experiment reports that: firstly, the prediction provided by conventional denoising hybrid models is unreliable due to the one-time denoising procedure. secondly, the proposed r-vmd-rvfl model achieves superior and robust accuracies in both monthly and weekly crude oil price predictions, especially when the forecast horizon is relatively long. furthermore, this study provides theoretical supports for the findings using the weak-form efficient market hypothesis and behavioral finance theory as well as technical analysis from the perspective of denoising methods. © 2023 elsevier b.v."

"purpose: this study aims to explore and clarify the mechanism by which recognition-based heuristic biases influence the investment decision-making and performance of individual investors, with the mediating role of fundamental and technical anomalies. design/methodology/approach: the deductive approach was used, as the research is based on behavioral finance's theoretical framework. a questionnaire and cross-sectional design were employed for data collection from the sample of 323 individual investors trading on the pakistan stock exchange (psx). hypotheses were tested through the structural equation modeling (sem) technique. findings: the article provides further insights into the relationship between recognition-based heuristic-driven biases and investment management activities. the results suggest that recognition-based heuristic-driven biases have a markedly positive influence on investment decision-making and negatively influence the investment performance of individual investors. the results also suggest that fundamental and technical anomalies mediate the relationships between the recognition-based heuristic-driven biases on the one hand and investment management activities on the other. practical implications: the results of the study suggested that investment management activities that rely on recognition-based heuristics would not result in better returns to investors. the article encourages investors to base decisions on investors' financial capability and experience levels and to avoid relying on recognition-based heuristics when making decisions related to investment management activities. the results provides awareness and understanding of recognition-based heuristic-driven biases in investment management activities, which could be very useful for decision-makers and professionals in financial institutions, such as portfolio managers and traders in commercial banks, investment banks and mutual funds. this paper helps investors to select better investment tools and avoid repeating the expensive errors that occur due to recognition-based heuristic-driven biases. originality/value: the current study is the first to focus on links recognition-based heuristic-driven biases, fundamental and technical anomalies, investment decision-making and performance of individual investors. this article enhanced the understanding of the role that recognition-based heuristic-driven biases plays in investment management. more importantly, the study went some way toward enhancing understanding of behavioral aspects and the aspects' influence on investment decision-making and performance in an emerging market. © 2022, emerald publishing limited."
"behavioral economics modeling assumes that the contractible commitments valued by sophisticated time-inconsistent agents come at a cost. this paper challenges this assumption by arguing that it disregards the benefits that providers derive from supplying commitment-based products. in our equilibrium model, the commitment embedded in an illiquid savings product is valuable to both market sides. although sophisticated time-inconsistent agents value the commitment, they do not have to pay for contracting it. the necessary and sufficient conditions for having a costless commitment contract in the savings market combine strong liquidity constraints imposed on banks and the occurrence of harmful shocks. our results have regulatory implications for social finance. © 2023"

"obesity is a debilitating disease of global proportions that necessitates refined, concept-driven therapeutic approaches. policy makers, the public and even health care professionals, but also individuals with obesity harbour many misconceptions regarding this disease, which leads to prejudice, negative attitudes, stigmatization, discrimination, self-blame, and failure to provide and finance adequate medical care. decades of intensive, successful scientific research on obesity have only had a very limited effect on this predicament. we propose a science-based, easy-to-understand conceptual model that synthesizes the complex pathogenesis of obesity including biological, psychological, social, economic and environmental aspects with the aim to explain and communicate better the nature of obesity and currently available therapeutic modalities. according to our integrative ‘behavioral balance model’, ‘top-down cognitive control’ strategies are implemented (often with limited success) to counterbalance the increased ‘bottom-up drive’ to gain weight, which is triggered by biological, psycho-social and environmental mechanisms in people with obesity. besides offering a deeper understanding of obesity, the model also highlights why there is a strong need for multimodal therapeutic approaches that may not only increase top-down control but also reduce a pathologically increased bottom-up drive. © 2023 john wiley & sons ltd."
"episodic foresight refers to one’s capacity to use imagined scenarios to guide future-directed behaviors. it is important in facilitating complex activities of daily living, such as managing finances. broader literature shows that older adults perform more poorly on tests of episodic foresight relative to their younger counterparts. at the same time, age-related changes in sleep often contribute to age-related decline in other cognitive abilities known to support episodic foresight, such as memory. no study to date has tested whether sleep quality is associated with episodic foresight when it is measured behaviorally; or whether this relationship is moderated by age. to address this, in the present study healthy younger (n = 39) and older (n = 41) adults were asked to wear an actigraphy watch and self-report their sleep quality for seven nights. participants then completed the virtual-week foresight task—a behavioral assessment of episodic foresight. neither objective or subjective sleep quality predicted episodic foresight outcomes, and this was not moderated by age group. bayesian analyses provided evidence in favour of the null hypotheses. these results suggest that sleep quality (at least in healthy adult populations) may not be linked to episodic foresight. © 2023, the author(s)."
"this study performs empirical tests to show several behavioral patterns in managerial decision-making using chinese data. based on the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) in 2003, caused by the same family of viruses as covid-19, we show that firms with board chairs that experienced sars during their tenure as senior executives invested less in subsequent periods. this effect is evident for board chairs that personally experienced the pandemic and those who prominently perceived their neighbor's operating distress during the sars outbreak. the impact persists and is amplified by other negative shocks, such as infectious diseases and economic uncertainty, which supports the validity of stimulus generalization theory in corporate finance. firms with board chairs that experienced sars invested even less during the covid-19 pandemic but performed relatively better during this same period than during normal business operations. however, the benefit was somewhat smaller than the overall loss. this study supports the finding that the long-lasting impact of pandemic-induced operating distress can distort the real economy. our findings have meaningful implications for assessing the long-term economic effects of covid-19. © 2023 elsevier b.v."
"the current fraud risk in digital finance is increasing year by year, and the mainstream solutions rely on the inherent characteristics of users, which makes it difficult to explain fraud behaviors and fraud behavior patterns are less researched. to address these problems, we propose an integrated multiple relational graphs fraud detection model tri-rgcn-xgboost, which analyzes the impact of user association patterns on fraud detection by mining the behavioral associations of users. the model builds a heterogeneous information network based on real transaction data, abstracts three types of bipartite graphs (user–device, user–merchant, and user–address), aggregates the information of the user’s neighbor nodes under the three types of behavioral patterns, and integrates the graph convolution classification results under the three behavioral patterns with the xgboost model to achieve fraudulent user detection with integrated multiple relational graphs. the results show that the performance of this model in fraud identification is significantly improved, especially in reducing the fraudulent user underreporting rate. further, the behavioral associations that play a key role in fraud user identification are analyzed in conjunction with shape value to provide a reference for fraud pattern mining. © 2023 by the authors."
"survey protocols measuring financial knowledge typically offer a don't know (dk) response option along with factual statements about personal finance. the potential problem of this practice is that a dk response could capture something other than financial knowledge and mislead empirical research on the association between financial knowledge and behavioral outcomes. in this study, we examined whether the current scales are contaminated by systemic personality effects and how reduced validity influences analytical modeling of the knowledge effect. two studies with different national datasets were conducted in this investigation. study 1 found that personality types and emotions are partially correlated with the propensity to give a dk response. study 2 showed that controlling for dk response options alters the association between financial knowledge and behaviors in regression analyses. our findings suggest that a dk response reduces construct validity of the financial knowledge score. © 2023 american council on consumer interests."
"research on vaccines in the law and social sciences skews heavily toward an instrumentalist approach to knowledge in service of vaccine promotion. overcoming hesitancy and promoting vaccine acceptance have been major goals, but successful levers for behavioral change remain elusive. research with constructivist approaches to vaccines from feminist sociology and anthropology has uncovered ethnographic richness to describe how vaccine debates illuminate inequalities in parenting and re-entrench patterns of racism and colonialism. there is considerable potential in science and technology studies approaches that take seriously the materiality and movement of vaccines in networks of production, finance, and global politics, though there are considerable methodological challenges for these research designs. this review charts the lopsided bibliography of law and social science research on vaccines, asking why scholars rarely move away from instrumentalist conceptions of law in the service of public health and, when they do, explaining what theoretical tools enable it. © 2023 by the author(s)."
"purpose: the primary goal of this study is to look at the behavioral factors that influence an individual's decision to invest in the pakistan stock exchange (psx). design/methodology/approach: existing behavioral finance theories serve as a foundation for hypotheses. further hypotheses were investigated by disseminating questionnaire results from a number of individual pakistani investors. brokerage and asset management fund managers were also questioned in semi-structured interviews. the obtained data were analyzed using statistical package for the social sciences, and latent variables were identified using the structural equation model (sem) and an asset management operating system (amos). findings: individual investor investment decisions in the psx are influenced by five behavioral factors: herding, market, prospect, overconfidence and gambler fallacy and anchoring-ability bias. the majority of the variables have a modest impact; however, the market component has a significant impact. only three behavioral elements, herding, prospect and heuristic, are found to influence investment performance among the behavioral factors stated above. heuristic habits have been discovered to have the greatest positive impact on investment performance. practical implications: this study is one of the few in pakistan that looked at the factors that influence stock investment decisions using behavioral finance. prior research has only considered the effects of a restricted number of behavioral characteristics on pakistani individual investors; however, this study seeks to use a whole collection of behavioral factors to examine their impacts on pakistani individual investors. research limitations: the focus of the study remains on the individual investor, whereas the impact of institutional investors on investment behavior could bring different outcomes. originality/value: this is among the few studies that investigated the impact of cognitive factors on investment decisions in the context of pakistan and will help policy makers, opinion makers and individuals. © 2021, emerald publishing limited."
"cyber-physical-human systems (cphs) represent significant extensions of cyber-physical systems (cps) to include aspects of human interactions and usage. a class of cphs of interest here is smart products that offer services to their customers, supported by back-end systems (e.g., information, finance) and other infrastructure. we argue that although the domain of cps relies on engineering and computer science as its foundations, the emerging field of cphs does not have an underlying scientific foundation. transdisciplinary teams of researchers are needed to integrate the engineering, computing, and human behavioral fields that are central to cphs to develop new foundational theory and methodology. furthermore, a new design methodology is needed for cphs, given the transdisciplinary nature of the field, that anticipates human acceptability and usability considerations as well as emerging behaviors that result from human-system interactions. in this paper, we propose a framework for such a design methodology. the domain of assistive and rehabilitation technology is used in this paper to provide an example field of practice that could benefit from a systematic design methodology. a cphs design example is provided to illustrate the application of the methodology framework.  © 2023 the authors."
"purpose: this study examines the cognitive factors of adopting blockchain technology in various supply chain scenarios and its role in reframing the distinctive values of supply chain financing. based on expectancy theory, this study explores the different profiles underlying the components of expectancy, valence and instrumentality. design/methodology/approach: this is a multiple-case study of four fintech companies using blockchain technology to promote the performance of supply chain operations and financing. findings: the results show that blockchain-enabled supply chain finance (bscf) can be classified into four scenarios based on the scope and purpose of blockchain technology applications. the success of bscf depends on the profiles of bscf expectancy (the recognized purpose and scope of bscf), instrumentality (identified blockchain attributes and other technology combinations) and valence (the perceived distinctive value of bscf). blockchain attributes help solve information asymmetry problems and enhance financing performance in two ways: one is supporting transparency, traceability and verification of transmissions and the other entails facilitating a transformation to new business models. originality/value: this research applies a new perspective based on expectancy theory to study how cognitive factors affect fintech companies' blockchain solutions under a given supply chain operation or financing activity. it explains the behavioral antecedents for applying blockchain technology, the situations appropriate for the different roles of blockchain technology and the profiles for realizing the value of blockchain technology. © 2023, emerald publishing limited."
"decisions in management and finance rely on information that often includes win-lose feedback (e.g., gains and losses, success and failure). simple reinforcement then suggests to blindly repeat choices if they led to success in the past and change them otherwise, which might conflict with bayesian updating of beliefs. we use finite mixture models and hidden markov models, adapted from machine learning, to uncover behavioral heterogeneity in the reliance on difference behavioral rules across and within individuals in a belief-updating experiment. most decision makers rely both on bayesian updating and reinforcement. paradoxically, an increase in incentives increases the reliance on reinforcement because the win-lose cues become more salient. copyright: © 2023 the author(s)"
"this study investigates the anomalies of winner-loser portfolios and anomalies of size effect on lq45 stocks in the indonesia stock exchange (idx), period 2015-2020. the paired sample t-test (parametric) and wilcoxon test (non-parametric) are used to test samples. sample selection is carried out using the non-probability and purposive sampling methods. the shares of companies that met the sample criteria were 26. the primary data used cumulative abnormal returns and market capitalization as proxies for a company's stock size. the anomaly of the winner-loser effect phenomenon is observed by dividing the data into two periods: the formation period and the testing period. the periods are both short-term and long-term. the short-term period is six months, and the long-term is 12 months. the first finding shows reversals in average cumulative abnormal returns (cars) on the winner-loser stock portfolio. in the testing period, the average cars were turned down, and many average cars became negative. portfolio loser in the testing period, the average cars reversed to positive. the second is a reversal in average cars in winner-loser stock portfolios caused by the size effect. the performance of small winner-loser portfolios is proven to outperform big winners' portfolios. the reversal occurs in both the short-term and long-term. this finding suggests that behavioral finance can explain this market anomaly, and it is helpful for investors in coming up with strategies to get abnormal returns. © 2023 conscientia beam. all rights reserved."
"smartwatches are used by millions of people for applications in health, finance, and communication. as the computational power and range of applications supported by these devices expand, it is becoming more and more important to secure access to them. while various user authentication technologies have been extensively explored in smartphone use scenarios (e.g., faceid, fingerprint, pin, or pattern) the applicability of these approaches to smartwatches is typically limited due to the small watch form factor. to improve authentication on smartwatches, we propose sonarauth, a novel user authentication system for unmodified commercial smartwatches using behavioral biometrics derived from motion, touch, and around-device motions. to capture in-air hand motions, we adapted an existing sonar system for smartwatches. we collected data from 24 participants from single touch to the watch screen with the thumb, index, and middle fingers. using a multimodal deep learning classifier, we achieved a promising mean equal error rate(eer) of 6.41% for user authentication based on a single thumb tap. we note that our system is usable and has good potential to be combined with other authentication modalities. © 2023 owner/author."

"behavioral finance has become a challenge to the scientific community. based on the assumption that behavioral aspects of investors may explain some features of the stock market, we propose an agent-based model to study quantitatively this relationship. in order to approximate the simulated market to the complexity of real markets, we consider that the investors are connected among them through a scale-free network; each one of the investors has his own psychological profile (imitation, anti-imitation, random); two different strategies for decision making: one of them is based on the trust neighborhood of the investor and the other one considers a technical analysis, the momentum of the market index technique. we analyze the market index fluctuations, the wealth distribution of the investors according to their psychological profiles and the rate of returns distribution. moreover, we analyze the influence of changing the psychological profile of the hub of the network and report interesting results which show how and when anti-imitation becomes the most profitable strategy for investment. besides this, an intriguing asymmetry of the rate of returns distribution is explained considering the behavioral aspect of the investors. this asymmetry is quite robust, being observed even when a completely different algorithm to calculate the decision making of the investors was applied to it, a remarkable result which, up to our knowledge, has never been reported before. © 2023"
"purpose: the objective of this paper is to investigate the pandemic’s function as a driver of investor herding in international stock markets, given that the current coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) crisis has caused a large rise in uncertainty. design/methodology/approach: the paper investigates the presence of herding behavior among the developed and brics (brazil, russia, india, china and south africa) stock market indices during the covid-19 crisis, by using a modified cross-sectional absolute deviation (csad) measure which is considered a proxy for herding and the wavelet coherence (wc) analysis between csad that captures the different inter-linkages between stock markets. findings: using the csad model, the authors' findings indicate that the herding behavior of investors is present in stock markets during the four waves of covid-19 crisis. the results also demonstrate that the transaction volume improve the herding behavior in the stock markets. as for the news concerning the number of cases caused by the pandemic, the results show that the pandemic does not stimulate herding; however, the number of deaths caused by this pandemic turns out to be a great stimulator of herding. by using the wc analysis, the authors' findings indicate the presence of herding behavior between the chinese and stock markets (developed and emerging), especially during the first wave of the crisis and the presence of herding behavior between the indian and stock markets (developed and emerging) in the medium and long run, especially during the third wave of the covid-19 crisis. originality/value: the authors' study is among the first that examines the influence of the recent covid-19 pandemic as a stimulator of herding behavior between stock markets. the study also uses the wc analysis next to the csad model to obtain robust results. the authors' results are consistent with the mental bias of behavioral finance where herding behavior is considered effective in volatility predictions and decision-making for international investors, specifically during the covid-19 crisis. © 2022, emerald publishing limited."
"background: people with hiv (pwh) are disproportionately vulnerable to the impacts of wildfires, given the need for frequent access to healthcare systems, higher burden of comorbidities, higher food insecurity, mental and behavioral health challenges, and challenges of living with hiv in a rural area. in this study, we aim to better understand the pathways through which wildfires impact health outcomes among pwh. methods: from october 2021 through february 2022, we conducted individual semi-structured qualitative interviews with pwh impacted by the northern california wildfires and clinicians of pwh who were impacted by wildfires. the study aims were to explore the influence of wildfires on the health of pwh and to discuss measures at the individual, clinic, and system levels that helped to mitigate these impacts. results: we interviewed 15 pwh and 7 clinicians. while some pwh felt that surviving the hiv epidemic added to their resilience against wildfires, many felt that the wildfires compounded the hiv-related traumas that they have experienced. participants outlined five main routes by which wildfires negatively impacted their health: (1) access to healthcare (medications, clinics, clinic staff), (2) mental health (trauma; anxiety, depression, or stress; sleep disturbances; coping strategies), (3) physical health (cardiopulmonary, other co-morbidities), (4) social/economic impacts (housing, finances, community), and (5) nutrition and exercise. the recommendations for future wildfire preparedness were at the (1) individual-level (what to have during evacuation), (2) pharmacy-level (procedural, staffing), and (3) clinic- or county-level (funds and vouchers; case management; mental health services; emergency response planning; other services such as telehealth, home visits, home laboratory testing). conclusions: based on our data and prior research, we devised a conceptual framework that acknowledges the impact of wildfires at the community-, household-, and individual-level with implications for physical and mental health outcomes among pwh. these findings and framework can help in developing future interventions, programs, and policies to mitigate the cumulative impacts of extreme weather events on the health of pwh, particularly among individuals living in rural areas. further studies are needed to examine health system strengthening strategies, innovative methods to improve access to healthcare, and community resilience through disaster preparedness. trial registration: n/a. © 2023, the author(s)."
"emerging technologies in the digital context can favor industrial sector firms in their aim to improve their performance. digitalization is mainly expressed through the utilization of big data that originate from various sources. blockchain technology has led to the extended adoption of capitalization of decentralized finance (defi) services, such as cryptocurrency trade platforms. supply chain firms, in their quest to exploit any means and collaborations available to promote their services, could place advertisements on defi’s social media profiles to boost their financial performance. social media analytics, as a part of the big data family, are an emerging tool for promoting a firm’s digital transformation, based on the plethora of customer behavioral data they provide. this study aims to examine whether the social media analytics of defi platforms are capable of affecting their website visibility, as well as the financial performance of supply chain firms. to do so, the authors collected data from the social media profiles of the most-known defi platforms and web analytics from the most significant supply chain firms’ websites. for this purpose, proper statistical analysis, fuzzy cognitive mapping, hybrid modeling, and cognitive neuromarketing models were adopted. throughout the present research, it has been discerned that from an increase in the social media analytics of defi platforms, their website visibility increases, while the organic and paid traffic costs of supply chain firms decrease. supply chain firms’ website customers tend to increase at the same time. © 2023 by the authors."
"implied volatility has consistently demonstrated its reliability as a superior estimator of the expected short-term volatility of underlying assets. in this study, we employ the newly constructed robust model-free implied volatility (mfiv) indices for bitcoin and ethereum (bitvol and ethvol) to explore the asymmetric return-volatility relationship of these cryptocurrencies through the lens of behavioral finance theories. utilizing the asymmetric quantile regression model (qrm) and the non-linear ardl (nardl) approach, our results reveal a notable difference from equities. both positive and negative return shocks in the cryptocurrency market lead to an increase in volatility. however, during high volatility regimes, positive (negative) return shocks exert a more substantial impact on positive innovations of volatility for bitcoin (ethereum) compared to negative (positive) return shocks. the degree of asymmetry steadily intensifies as we progress from medium to uppermost quantiles of the volatility distribution. these observed phenomena can be attributed to behavioral aspects among market participants, including noise trading, behavioral biases, and fear of missing out (fomo). our findings hold significant implications for various aspects of cryptocurrency trading, portfolio hedging strategies, volatility derivatives pricing, and risk management. © 2023"
"exchange rate volatility is a vital issue in international finance due to its effect on the value of the firm, depending on firm's exposure to the exchange rate risk. however, this impact is not clear in literature as evidence is mixed. this article analyses the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on firm value. a system dynamics-based corporate planning model has been developed that incorporates the modules for financial and physical processes, firm valuation and exchange rate determination. simulation results reveal that a stronger home currency leads to an increase in market price per share of the firm and vice versa. the results provide counter intuitive evidence on the impact of exchange rate on firm value and provide nonlinear feedback loop-based explanation. the study fills the gap in literature by incorporating a systemic approach in the strategic planning process to assess the composite impact of parameter changes on key variables. © 2022 the authors. systems research and behavioral science published by international federation for systems research and john wiley & sons ltd."

"the covid-19 epidemic has hastened the growth of virtual communities and is affecting virtually every part of work in the public and business sectors. virtual communities, popular forums for communication and entertainment, increasingly affected the users’ decisions. though many technology adoption models/theories are available, a distinctive model for decision-making in a virtual environment is scarce. this research developed the virtual communities’ decision model and empirically tested its performance. this study examined 16 well-established theories/models of information technology, social science, marketing, and behavioral finance and extracted nine constructs from 58 identified constructs considering theoretical cohesiveness along with the three-stage method proposed by moore and benbasat. a unified model for virtual communities’ decisions (vcdm) is developed and validated using the data collected from individual capital market investors in bangladesh. the structural equation modeling technique is used to analyze the data. the upshot implies that vcdm performs adequately and explains the maximum variances in intention to decision and investment. vcdm also outperforms the majority of the related theoretical models. the acceptance levels of fit indices and all significant relationships among different constructs are also empirically validated. the moderating effect of the virtual group use experience is also confirmed. future research can use vcdm in marketing, behavioral finance, ecommerce, information systems and social science context. vcdm thus facilitates a beneficial tool for managers, service providers, and other users to assess the likelihood of effectiveness for decisions in a virtual environment. © the author(s) 2023."

"to understand the behavioral intentions of bank employees to implement green finance, this study explores the impact of attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control on behavioral intention based on the theory of planned behavior. in addition, this study also examines whether internal measures have moderating effects on the relationship between attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and behavioral intention. by collecting 123 questionnaires from 18 september 2022 to 18 october 2022, this study uses hierarchical regression to discuss the aforementioned issues. in order to avoid the possible bias of the regression model, the variance inflation factor (vif) is applied to detect multicollinearity problems. the empirical results of this study find that bank employees’ attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and internal measures to implement green finance have a significant and positive impact on behavioral intention. in addition, the coefficients of vif in all regression models are smaller than 10, indicating that the multicollinearity problems are not serious in this study. therefore, our inferences are not affected by correlations between independent variables in the regression model. the research finding also shows that the interaction effects of internal measures and attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control do not have a positive moderating effect on behavioral intention. the implications of this study are that it can be provided as a reference for the banking industry to help them to improve the comprehensive thinking of employees in the implementation of green financial behavioral intentions. © 2023 by the authors."
"the present study aims to investigate elementary school children s self-control as an important aspect of their purchasing literacy in a simulated supermarket. to this end, 136 children were asked to shop on a limited budget and work through a given shopping list. we processed the data of this task in two ways: first, we combined process and product data into a common score for a differentiated assessment of task performance. second, we derived theory-based behavioral indicators from the log data. by means of a structural equation model, we confirmed that the covariance between them could be explained by a factor of self-control. within the structural equation model, we also investigated whether self-controlled behavior mediated the relationship between self-reported impulsivity and task performance. this could not be confirmed, even though self-controlled behavior was positively related to task performance. self-control and impulsivity both correlated positively with a distrustful attitude toward advertising. higher self-control was also significantly related to better monitoring one s finances at the point of sale. © 2023 the author(s)."

"purpose: this study aims to explain investors’ intention to invest in the stock market amid the covid-19 pandemic by expanding the theory of planned behavior (tpb). design/methodology/approach: this study adopts a quantitative approach, and a questionnaire-based survey was conducted to collect responses from existing and potential individual investors. to test the relationships between variables, structural equation modeling was used. findings: the findings indicated that investors’ attitude and perceived behavioral control had a significant influence on investment intentions. further, perceived knowledge of covid-19 improved the ability to predict the intention to invest. moreover, psychological risk significantly moderated the association between subjective norms related to investors and their attitudes. overall, the tested model was able to better account for the intention of investors in stock market investments. research limitations/implications: in this study, only the investor reactions in the context of an emerging market were evaluated, and future studies could focus on different market contexts and perform comparative studies. financial markets could be considered as a mechanism that has a direct impact on the wealth distribution of society, and the key findings of this study could be used to promote investment in emerging markets, where participation is comparatively low. originality/value: the tpb was expanded by incorporating investors’ perceived knowledge of covid-19 and psychological risk dimensions, which were then tested in an emerging market context to fill the knowledge gap identified in the contemporary behavioral finance literature. © 2022, emerald publishing limited."
"purpose: the author proposes an update to the mean variance (mv) framework that replaces a constant risk aversion parameter using a dynamic risk aversion indicator. the contribution to the literature is made through making the static risk aversion parameter operational using an indicator of market sentiment. results suggest that sharpe ratios improve when the author replaces the traditional risk aversion parameter with a dynamic sentiment indicator from the behavioral finance literature when allocating between a risky portfolio and a risk-free asset. however, results are mixed when using the behavioral framework to allocate between two risky assets. design/methodology/approach: the author includes a dynamic risk aversion parameter in the mean variance framework and back test using the traditional and updated behavioral mean variance (bmv) framework to see which framework leads to better performance. findings: the author finds that the behavioral framework provides superior performance when allocating between a risky and risk-free asset; however, it under performs when allocating between risky assets. research limitations/implications: the research is based on back testing; therefore, it cannot be concluded that this strategy will perform well in real-time circumstances. practical implications: portfolio managers may use this strategy to optimize the allocation between a risky portfolio and a risk-free asset. social implications: an improved allocation between risk-free and risky assets that could lead to less leverage in the market. originality/value: the study is the first to use such a sentiment indicator in the traditional mv framework and show the math. © 2021, emerald publishing limited."
"the current study aims to determine the factors influencing the behavioral intention of merchants to use mobile payment services (mps). the study surveys 215 indian merchants from a personally administered online survey process. the study includes six factors, namely: perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, perceived experience, perceived cost, perceived trust, and word of mouth learning to measure the merchant’s intention with mobile payment service. the study also tested the mediating and moderating effect of perceived experience in the relation between word-of-mouth learning and the merchant’s intention. perceived usefulness of mps influences perceived experience, followed by perceived ease of use. the result concludes that the perceived experience is the most influencing variable, followed by word-of-mouth learning to influence merchant’s intentions to use mps both directly and indirectly (significant mediating and moderating effect). the study offers few implications to banks, finance companies, payment companies to understand factors driving merchants’ intention to use mps. © 2022, the author(s), under exclusive licence to springer nature limited."

"purpose: this research aims to investigate the bibliometric characteristics of existing studies published in scopus-indexed journals to comprehend the most recent movements in cryptocurrency publishing, the primary themes in cryptocurrency, and factors impacting them, and analyze the citation network of the cryptocurrency based on the previously published scopus indexed journals. cryptocurrencies have emerged as a new asset class, and individuals and organizations often face investment decisions related to cryptocurrencies. decision science techniques, such as risk analysis, portfolio optimization, and behavioral economics, can be applied to assess the risks and potential returns associated with cryptocurrency investments. these techniques help investors make informed decisions based on risk tolerance, financial goals, and market conditions. design/methodology: both citation network analysis and author co-citation analysis are used in our analysis based on cryptocurrency articles written in 2019 from 2013 to 2022 with top titles including current issues in auditing and international review of financial analysis to find both keywords and track bitcoin-related cited works. the research also uses vos viewer and r in the analysis to visualize both data networks and spread findings: in our analysis, we find that cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency, blockchain, and distributed ledger technology were the most commonly-used terms, studying cryptocurrency in emerging nations is difficult due to significant social disparities and poor reading levels, guglielmo maria caporale is the most cited author in this area with three works and 147 citations up to the moment of our study, the most cryptocurrency-focused institution is the sumy state institution in ukraine, which has produced two papers up to the moment of our study, and india gets the most publications in the area, followed by the united states, china, the united kingdom, russia, and so on, and the united arab emirates comes in last place regarding cryptocurrency-related publications. our study claims no consensus on defining cryptocurrency, leading authors to use varying terms, words such as cryptocurrency, blockchain, cryptocurrency, and distributed ledger technology are often used equally, and cryptocurrency research has had a significant uptick over the past decade and is increasing at an impressive rate. practical implications: the research findings have several practical implications for cryptocurrency, specifically regarding bitcoin patterns that benefit researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders. for instance, researchers can utilize the study's information to explore new areas and understand the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency research. policymakers can leverage the insights to develop effective policies and initiatives, enhancing regulation, risk assessment, and consumer protection in cryptocurrency ecosystems. the research contributes to a broader understanding of cryptocurrency's dynamics, societal impact, and implications for finance, economy, and society. this knowledge aids informed decision-making for individuals, businesses, and organizations involved with cryptocurrency. originality: cryptocurrency citation network analysis has been used in this study. it explains why some writers are cited extensively around the globe while others are cited so rarely locally. indications are that the worldwide citation is much greater. however, the number of local to worldwide citations is low and could be improved by prioritizing better local citations. therefore, the study concludes that scholarly interest in cryptocurrency is new and has excellent potential for future research. © 2023 hindawi limited. all rights reserved."
"policy points the erosion of electoral democracy in the united states in recent decades may have contributed to the high and rising working-age mortality rates, which predate the covid-19 pandemic. eroding electoral democracy in a us state was associated with higher working-age mortality from homicide, suicide, and especially from drug poisoning and infectious disease. state and federal efforts to strengthen electoral democracy, such as banning partisan gerrymandering, improving voter enfranchisement, and reforming campaign finance laws, could potentially avert thousands of deaths each year among working-age adults. context: working-age mortality rates are high and rising in the united states, an alarming fact that predates the covid-19 pandemic. although several reasons for the high and rising rates have been hypothesized, the potential role of democratic erosion has been overlooked. this study examined the association between electoral democracy and working-age mortality and assessed how economic, behavioral, and social factors may have contributed to it. methods: we used the state democracy index (sdi), an annual summary of each state's electoral democracy from 2000 to 2018. we merged the sdi with annual age-adjusted mortality rates for adults 25–64 years in each state. models estimated the association between the sdi and working-age mortality (from all causes and six specific causes) within states, adjusting for political party control, safety net generosity, union coverage, immigrant population, and stable characteristics of states. we assessed whether economic (income, unemployment), behavioral (alcohol consumption, sleep), and social (marriage, violent crime, incarceration) factors accounted for the association. findings: increasing electoral democracy in a state from a moderate level (defined as the third quintile of the sdi distribution) to a high level (defined as the fifth quintile) was associated with an estimated 3.2% and 2.7% lower mortality rate among working-age men and women, respectively, over the next year. increasing electoral democracy in all states from the third to the fifth quintile of the sdi distribution may have resulted in 20,408 fewer working-age deaths in 2019. the democracy–mortality association mainly reflected social factors and, to a lesser extent, health behaviors. increasing electoral democracy in a state was mostly strongly associated with lower mortality from drug poisoning and infectious diseases, followed by reductions in homicide and suicide. conclusions: erosion of electoral democracy is a threat to population health. this study adds to growing evidence that electoral democracy and population health are inextricably linked. © 2023 milbank memorial fund."
"purpose: researchers in the field recognize the importance of the relationship between contractor and contractee in the process of information technology (it) outsourcing. however, little is known about the impact of the manager's profile in this process. thus, the objective of this research was to analyze the impact of the perception of competence, autonomy and relationship of public managers on relational governance (rg), as well as, to identify the effect of perceived control in this relationship. design/methodology/approach: this study uses a quantitative approach to investigate the impact of the behavioral characteristics of it managers from the self-determination theory (sdt). the data were collected in brazilian public institutions active in the areas of education, finance, statistics and technology, and the hypotheses were identified and evaluated using the technique of partial least squares structural equation modeling (pls-sem). findings: the results identified that managers' self-determination is related to the perception of control, which, consequently, impacts the rg by providing feelings of competence and autonomy capable of building a beneficial relationship with the it provider. practical implications: this study promotes the understanding that upper management needs to support the autonomy of managers to increase their levels of intrinsic motivation when managing supplier deliveries. originality/value: the application of sdt to the it outsourcing context provides new insights into the mediation of perceived control by explaining the relationship between managers' expectations and motivations as an important driver for rg. © 2023, emerald publishing limited."
"purpose: this study investigates the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on investors' sentiments, behavioral biases and investment decisions in the pakistan stock exchange (psx). design/methodology/approach: the authors have assessed investors' behaviors and sentiments and the stock market overreaction during covid-19 using a questionnaire and collected data from 401 investors trading in the psx. findings: results of structural equation modeling revealed that the covid-19 pandemic affected investors' behaviors, investment decisions and trade volume. it created feelings of fear and uncertainty among market participants. evidence suggests that behavioral heuristics and biases, including representative heuristic, anchoring heuristic, overconfidence bias and disposition effect, negatively influenced investors' decisions at the psx. research limitations/implications: this study will contribute to behavioral finance literature in the context of developing countries as it has revealed the impact of covid-19 on the emerging stock market, and its results are generalizable to other emerging stock markets. practical implications: the findings of this study will help academicians, researchers and policymakers of developing countries. academicians can formulate new behavioral models that can depict the solutions of dealing with an uncertain situation like covid-19. policymakers like the securities exchange commission and the psx can formulate crisis management strategies based on behavioral finance concepts to cope with situations like covid-19 in the future and help lessen investors' losses in the stock markets. the role of the securities exchange commission is crucial as it regulates the financial markets. it can arrange workshops to educate investors to manage their decisions during crisis time and focus on the best use of irrational and rational decision-making at the same time using lo (2004) adaptive market hypothesis. originality/value: the novelty of the paper is that the authors have introduced overconfidence and disposition effect as mediators that create a connection between representative and anchoring heuristics and investment decisions using primary data collected from investors (institutional and retail) to demonstrate the presence of psychological biases during covid-19, and it has been done for the first time according to authors' knowledge. it is a contribution and addition to the behavioral finance literature in the context of developing countries' stock markets and their efficiency. © 2021, emerald publishing limited."
"the existing literature predominantly focuses on investor disagreements and their implications for financial returns, but it typically ignores the significant influence of noninvestors (ie, people who do not physically trade securities). in response to this oversight, our study investigates the synchronism and hysteresis between social and investor disagreements, underpinned by an analysis of millions of noninvestment-oriented comments sourced from the sina weibo social media platform. for the convenience of research and description, we introduce a novel metric – noninvestor disagreement – that captures this hysteresis. further, when integrated into an asset pricing model, this metric demonstrates the ability to capture residuals that fall out-side the purview of the fama–french model. building upon these findings, we out-line several investment strategies that not only outperform the market, but also can be symbiotic with other investment strategies, suggesting an inclusive approach to strategic financial decision-making. in summary, this research augments the field of asset pricing and behavioral finance, offering a robust methodology for harnessing information typically overlooked by investors, thus enhancing the interpretive ability of asset pricing models. © 2023 infopro digital risk (ip) limited."
"news of extensions can cause stock price movements in the parent brand. marketers extend brands into areas that vary in how typical they are of the parent brand. the degree of extension typicality can be an important cue for investors in their performance expectations of the brand. integrating insights from categorization theory, behavioral finance, and berlyne’s two-factor theory, the authors argue that the impact of typicality on investor reactions depends upon the level of market exposure to a particular brand extension. our study emphasizes that firms should take critical marketing actions to influence the buzz around the launch, depending on the extension’s typicality level. the results support our hypotheses. particularly interesting is the finding that more atypical extensions become acceptable the greater market exposure to them (through marketing efforts as advertising and public relations). © 2023, the author(s)."
"this article examines the relationship between the financial risk-taking behavior of individual investors and their subjective and objective knowledge. the data come from multiple waves of surveys conducted by the national financial capability study between 2009 and 2018. we hypothesize that subjective knowledge will have a greater association with risk tolerance than objective knowledge of individual investors. regression models are estimated with least squares as well as with the ordered logit method. estimation results show that individual investors’ risk tolerance behavior is associated more with their subjective knowledge than their objective knowledge. this is true in all four surveys separately and in the combined sample. additionally, as hypothesized, the relative influence of subjective knowledge on risk tolerance, compared to objective knowledge, increases as the survey periods move further away from the financial recession of2007-2008. this article has important implications for behavioral and personal finance researchers, financial advisors, and regulators. © 2023 association for financial counseling and planning education."
"in china, the relationship between smart city policy (scp) and the development of digital inclusive finance (dif) partially mirrors the connection between the chinese government and large private capital. this study examines this relationship using data from the peking university digital financial inclusion index of china (pku-dfiic) and a difference-in-differences method. results indicate that scp may indirectly promote dif in pilot cities, exhibiting statistically significant growth compared to non-scp pilot cities. this promotion effect appears indirect, as negligible dif digitization growth in scp pilot cities suggests that the government’s objective is not to enhance large private capital-related digital infrastructure construction. moreover, dif in scp pilot cities demonstrates a statistically significant increase only in the depth of use, not in coverage. this study implies that, in china, large private capital’s behavioral logic is profit-seeking, and scp may be employed to facilitate digital financial services development. these findings uncover scp’s complex impact on dif in china and the strained government–capital relationship. the chinese government should prudently manage its relationship with capital in public policies and direct capital toward a more constructive role. © 2023 by the authors."
"we provide the first tests to distinguish whether individual investors equally balance their overall portfolios (naïve portfolio diversification, npd) or, in contrast, equally balance the values of same-day purchases of multiple assets (naïve buying diversification, nbd). we find nbd in purchases of multiple stocks, and in mixed purchases of individual stocks and funds. in contrast, there is little evidence of npd. evidence suggests that nbd arises due to stock picking behavior and neglect of diversification. these findings suggest that behavioral finance theory should incorporate transaction, as well as portfolio, framing. © 2023 the authors. the journal of finance published by wiley periodicals llc on behalf of american finance association."
"in the digital era, new financial technologies and big data are accelerating the development of financial transactions. with the rise of e-commerce transactions, the financial industry has come to recognize that banking as a service can be seamlessly integrated into any scenario, thanks to disruptive innovation driven by electronic and third-party payments. this study aims to examine the consumer acceptance of third-party payment systems offered by electronic payment platforms for e-commerce, as well as their continued usage in the context of digital transformation in finance. this study employed the questionnaire survey method, and it distributed questionnaires to consumers who have used third-party payment systems. a total of 332 valid questionnaires were collected. the results indicate that user acceptance of innovative technologies and various external variables (e.g., the user’s external environment, internal characteristics, and information system quality) were significantly positively correlated with perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and behavioral intention regarding the electronic payment behaviors of consumers. based on the empirical results, this study proposes important managerial implications for the financial industry and e-commerce platforms in promoting electronic payment innovation. © 2023 by the authors."
"purpose: this paper aims to analyze the heuristics and cognitive biases described by behavioral finance in the investment decision-making process of portugal’s housing market. design/methodology/approach: in a first step, the authors applied an exploratory factor analysis (efa) to assess the impact of heuristics and cognitive biases on investors’ decision-making. in a second step, the authors run a structural equation model (sem) diagram path to assess if the sociodemographic characteristics of housing market investors determine the identified heuristics and if the heuristics condition the investors’ investment criteria. findings: herd behavior and the heuristics of representativeness, availability and anchoring influence the housing market’s investors’ behavior in their decision-making process. investors with above-average income show higher levels of overconfidence. investors showing higher levels of overconfidence also tend to be more sensitive to the house price under analysis for investment. women tend to show higher levels of the availability and anchoring heuristic. in turn, housing market investors showing higher levels of availability and anchoring heuristic tend to be more sensitive to the price and location of the house under analysis for investment. research limitations/implications: the explained variance of the efa is below 50%, and the root mean square of approximation of the sem is above the threshold of 0.05. these indicators are evidence of the models’ fragility. practical implications: governments and regulators can better prevent real estate bubbles if they monitor behavioral biases and heuristics of housing investors together with quantitative indicators. realtors can profit from adapting their marketing strategy and commercial communication to investors of sociodemographic groups more prone to a specific type of heuristics. originality/value: to the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study that combines the contributions of behavioral finance with portugal’s housing investment market and the first study connecting heuristics to investment criteria. © 2022, emerald publishing limited."
"risk prediction, usually achieved by learning representations from patient's physiological sequence or user's behavioral sequence data, and has been widely applied in healthcare and finance. despite that, some recent time-aware deep learning methods have led to superior performances in such sequence representation learning tasks, such improvement is limited due to a lack of guidance from hierarchical global view. to address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end hierarchical global view-guided (hgv) sequence representation learning framework. specifically, the global graph embedding (gge) module is proposed to learn sequential clip-aware representations from temporal correlation graph (tcg) at instance level. furthermore, following the way of key-query attention, the harmonic β-attention (β-attn) is also developed for making a global tradeoff between time-aware decay and observation significance at channel level adaptively. moreover, the hierarchical representations at both instance level and channel level can be coordinated by the heterogeneous information aggregation under the guidance of global view. experimental results on both healthcare risk prediction benchmark and smes credit overdue risk prediction task from the real-world industrial scenario in mybank, ant group, have illustrated that the proposed model can achieve competitive prediction performance compared with other known baselines. the code has been released public available at: https://github.com/liyouru0228/hgv.  © 2023 copyright held by the owner/author(s). publication rights licensed to acm."

"the prominent form of non-fungible token (nft) is found in the gaming industry. nft games received immense attention during the covid-19 pandemic because of their play-to-earn model. nft gamers can enjoy and increase their finances in their spare time. hence, the researchers utilized structural equation modeling (sem) to investigate the intention and immersive behaviors of 1082 respondents. the modified framework from the theory of planned behavior (tpb) and hedonic motivation system adoption model (hmsam) underwent sem tests. these theories and methods were used to analyze relationships among hypotheses and assess factors influencing nft game engagement. the results showed that hedonic motivation produced positive and significant influences on perceived usefulness, curiosity, joy, attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. subjective norms significantly influenced perceived ease of use. in due course, perceived ease of use yielded positive and significant effects on perceived usefulness, joy, attitude, and perceived behavioral control. moreover, perceived usefulness, curiosity, joy, attitude, and perceived behavioral control had significant positive effects on behavioral intention. in addition, perceived usefulness, curiosity, joy, and attitude significantly and positively affected immersion. meanwhile, only four hypotheses were not supported by the study. these findings were translated into theoretical and managerial implications to contribute to the academe given the strong the change of behavior of users towards nft games during the pandemic; gaming industry since they will be able to develop, improve and create a new ecosystem in the gaming space, and nft stakeholders since they will benefit from the development that will influence this study. © 2023 the authors"
"despite the growing interest in basic income (bi) in recent years, the existing research has mainly focused on its impact on household finances. however, changes in household behavior may affect the actions of other decision makers, such as businesses and governments, leading to unanticipated outcomes. therefore, any analysis of bi must use a model with multilayered feedback from the actions of individual decision makers. to actualize such a model, household budgets, firms, and other entities must autonomously determine production levels, prices, and other factors, thereby encompassing a complete circulation of funds. this study constructs a macroeconomic model using agent-based modeling as a basic framework to achieve these goals, and it analyzes the emergent behaviors generated by bi and the labor supply in the economic system. the results show that although bi brings about more equitable consumption by households, it also creates a unique phenomenon wherein gross domestic product increases but economic activity in terms of capital investment stagnates. upon examining the impact of bi, the results of this study present the need to examine the multilayered feedback influencing mutual decision makers, which arises from the behavioral changes of individual decision makers caused by bi. © 2023 by the authors."
"this article addresses the issue of renewing a sense of vocation in finance. drawing on experiences in the uk, australia, and ireland, three common law jurisdictions at various phases of developing “an ethical esprit de corps” to professionalize the banking industry, it argues that adopting some aspects of a profession, a “trajectory towards professionalization” of the banking industry, could serve, at least to some extent, to improve the industry-wide norms that influence firms' cultures and individual behaviors. it contends that professionalization could help to develop bankers with a professional, pro-social identity, in which there is a recognition of broader obligations to society, that exists independently of the profit-driven nature of banking and the hierarchy of their own firms. this analysis is informed by an integration of regulatory theory, which casts doubt on the utility of sanctions except as a last resort, behavioral science, which offers insights into how ethics and culture, not just law and markets, can constrain irresponsible behavior in the financial services sector, and criminological theory, which emphasizes that particular types of controls, including individual attachments to groups, build “stakes in conformity” which encourage law abiding and responsible behaviors. © 2022 the authors. regulation & governance published by john wiley & sons australia, ltd."

"the covid-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on the mental health of the population. many studies reported high levels of psychological distress and rising rates of suicidal ideation (si). data on a range of psychometric scales from 1790 respondents were collected in slovenia through an online survey between july 2020 and january 2021. as a worrying percentage (9.7%) of respondents reported having si within the last month, the goal of this study was to estimate the presence of si, as indicated by the suicidal ideation attributes scale (sidas). the estimation was based on the change of habits, demographic features, strategies for coping with stress, and satisfaction with three most important aspects of life (relationships, finances, and housing). this could both help recognize the telltale factors indicative of si and potentially identify people at risk. the factors were specifically selected to be discreet about suicide, likely sacrificing some accuracy in return. we tried four machine learning algorithms: binary logistic regression, random forest, xgboost, and support vector machines. logistic regression, random forest, and xgboost models achieved comparable performance with the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.83 on previously unseen data. we found an association between various subscales of brief-cope and si; self-blame was especially indicative of the presence of si, followed by increase in substance use, low positive reframing, behavioral disengagement, dissatisfaction with relationships and lower age. the results showed that the presence of si can be estimated with reasonable specificity and sensitivity based on the proposed indicators. this suggests that the indicators we examined have a potential to be developed into a quick screening tool that would assess suicidality indirectly, without unnecessary exposure to direct questions on suicidality. as with any screening tool, subjects identified as being at risk, should be further clinically examined. © 2023"
"last two decades have witnessed a significant shift in investor perspective from traditional finance to behavioral finance, which underlines the burgeoning interplay of cognition and emotions in financial decision-making. irrationality among investors is unavoidable as behavioral biases play a vital role in determining investors' investing decisions in various markets. the psychological elements examined in this study are divided into two categories: heuristics and herding. the study's goal is to look at the impact of these biases on cryptocurrencies investors' investing decisions with risk tolerance as a mediator. a quantitative methodology is utilized, which includes a survey method as well as snowball sampling, resulting in 225 surveys from individual investors. in addition, we use smartpls to analyze the data and test the framed hypotheses. a significant impact of heuristics bias is found to be prominent in investing. the findings also highlight the importance of behavioral variables in investor decision-making. the association between behavioral biases and financial decisions is significantly influenced by risk tolerance. the verdicts' consequence is that hit and runs investors will be better equipped to stay in the cryptocurrency market and improve their skills in the most efficient way to make smart investment decisions. likewise, the outcomes of this research will inspire financial experts to recognize that standard finance theory knowledge is insufficient to succeed in the cryptocurrency market. © 2023 author(s)."
"while classical fiñañcial theories assume the rationality of the individual, behavioral finance supports the iñflueñce of cognitive and emotional aspects on investment decisions. the objective of this study is to contribute to this field by analyzing four biases – overcoñfideñce, herd behavior, player fallacy and hot hand fallacy, and domestic bias – and their relationship with investors’ personal characteristics, particularly in terms of their economic education and financial literacy. we also analyze the effect of the fiñañcial crisis derived from covid-19 on the aforementioned biases. this work is based on 109 surveys carried out in galicia with individual investors, both actual and would-be ones, operating in stock markets. the results coñfirm that (i) these biases exist and that they relate to fiñañcial education and fiñañcial literacy; the more individuals there are with limited fiñañcial knowledge, the more iñteñsified the biases are, and (ii) that for overcoñfideñce and herd behavior, they are more visible in prolonged crises. © universidade de santiago de compostela."

"purpose: this paper's purpose was to examine the impact of geomagnetic activity (gma) on the timing and valuation of earnings information disclosed by firms every quarter. design/methodology/approach: the authors start the analyses with a sample of 112,669 client firms from 1989 to 2018. to analyze the impact of gma on the earnings response coefficient (erc), the authors use the three-day cumulative abnormal returns and cumulative abnormal returns for the extended post-earnings announcement window [2, 75] as the dependent variables. the authors interact unexpected earnings (ue) with the c9 index, an index commonly used to measure gma and study how gma affects the pricing of new public information. to examine the effect of gma on the timing of disclosure of earnings news, the authors regress a variant of the gma index on the propensity to disclose bad earnings news. findings: the authors find significantly lower earnings response coefficients during periods of high gma. this effect is permanent and stock prices do not correctly incorporate the implications of earnings information over time. the authors also show that managerial behavior is affected by gma as well and the managers are more (less) likely to release bad (good) news during periods of higher activity. finally, the authors also find that in situations where stakeholders are likely to rely on modern technology that depends minimally on humans, the adverse impact of gma on the pricing of earnings information is mitigated. originality/value: the literature on the effect of gma on the capital market is very limited and focuses primarily on stock returns, while the behavioral finance literature focuses on circumstances like weather, temperature and sporting outcome to study how the investors' mood affects their capital market behavior. the authors add to both the literature by investigating how gma influences investors' and managers' behaviors in the capital market. © 2023, emerald publishing limited."
"plasticity is increasingly recognized as a critical concept in psychiatry and mental health because it allows the reorganization of neural circuits and behavior during the transition from psychopathology to wellbeing. differences in individual plasticity may explain why therapies, such as psychotherapeutic and environmental interventions, are highly effective in some but not in all patients. here i propose a mathematical formula to assess plasticity – i.e., the susceptibility to change – to identify, at baseline, which individuals or populations are more likely to modify their behavioral outcome according to therapies or contextual factors. the formula is grounded in the network theory of plasticity so that, when representing a system (e.g., a patient's psychopathology) as a weighed network where the nodes are the system features (e.g., symptoms) and the edges are the connections (i.e., correlations) among them, the network connectivity strength is an inverse measure of the plasticity of the system: the weaker the connectivity, the higher the plasticity and the greater the susceptibility to change. the formula is predicted to be generalizable, measuring plasticity at multiple scales, from the single cell to the whole brain, and can be applied to a wide range of research fields, including neuroscience, psychiatry, ecology, sociology, physics, market and finance. © 2023 elsevier ltd"

"our paper explores whether chinese insurance companies exhibit a local preference in deciding their equity portfolios and the incentive of this preference. our research finds that chinese insurance institutional investors significantly tilt to invest in local firms geographically close to them, and local investments do not significantly outperform non-local investments. the results indicate that the behavioral aspect of home bias, rather than information advantage, play a more significant role in deciding equity holdings of china’s insurance companies. additionally, local equity preference is more pronounced in dialect-segmented areas and life insurance firms. this paper incorporates hometown identification into the analysis framework of insurance companies’ portfolio decision-making and enriches the research of their investing strategies from the perspective of behavioral finance. copyright: © 2023 yang et al. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited."
"competitive intelligence in social media analytics has significantly influenced behavioral finance worldwide in recent years; it is continuously emerging with a high growth rate of unpredicted variables per week. several surveys in this large field have proved how social media involvement has made a trackless network using machine learning techniques through web applications and android modes using interoperability. this article proposes an improved social media sentiment analytics technique to predict the individual state of mind of social media users and the ability of users to resist profound effects. the proposed estimation function tracks the counts of the aversion and satisfaction levels of each inter- and intra-linked expression. it tracks down more than one ontologically linked activity from different social media platforms with a high average success rate of 99.71%. the accuracy of the proposed solution is 97% satisfactory, which could be effectively considered in various industrial solutions such as emo-robot building, patient analysis and activity tracking, elderly care, and so on. © 2023 by the authors."
"the purpose of this study is to conduct a comparative analysis of investor sentiment and trading behavior in the field of behavioral finance. this study analyzes and compares the research evolution within these two domains using various scientometric analysis methods. the analysis reveals that the number of publications in the field of investor sentiment has grown exponentially while research activity in trading behavior has slowed down in recent years. investor sentiment research has attracted more attention and generated more publications despite a relatively late start. the usa and china are the major countries conducting research in these two fields and the research output is primarily derived from economically developed regions. investor sentiment and trading behavior research shows a convergence trend with common research hotspots including covid-19, bitcoin and machine learning. both fields are concentrated in financial market research and have emerging research frontiers such as financial crises, social media and cryptocurrencies. highly cited articles indicate a degree of overlap between the two fields wherein the domain of trading behavior is predominantly linked to investor sentiment. this study provides valuable insights into the research progress on investor sentiment and trading behavior. © 2023 by the authors; licensee online academic press, usa."
"background: occupation is a known determinant of worker physical and behavioral health risk, yet most previous studies have focused on unemployment, underemployment, and job satisfaction to understand child maltreatment risk. objective: this county-level study (n = 278) investigated the association between occupation and child maltreatment rates and community well-being in california, colorado, minnesota, oregon, and new mexico. participants and setting: states were selected due to having comparable, publicly available county-level data on substantiated child abuse and neglect rates within a five-year span between 2015 and 2020. methods: using us census bureau american community survey data, we collected percentages of the employed population among 13 occupations. five additional community health indicators came from the county health rankings and roadmaps. elastic net linear regression was used for variable selection and because of explanatory variables' interrelationships. linear regression was used to model individual industries positively associated with child abuse rates. results: the elastic net model selected ten important variables in explaining child maltreatment rates. important occupational sectors were agriculture, forestry, fishing (aff), manufacturing, wholesale, retail, finance, and education. important community indicators included housing, injury deaths, and poor mental health days. only aff and retail showed greater child abuse rates with increasing percentages of the workforce in these occupations in unadjusted models (aff: β = 0.03 se = 0.01, p = 0.02; retail: β = 0.09 se = 0.04, p = 0.02). conclusions: our findings suggest group-level effects of counties with a larger aff and retail presence experiencing higher child maltreatment rates. given that numerous prior studies of county economies note the strong associations of certain employment types with cultural attitudes, educational opportunities, regional biases, and other unmeasured variables, future studies should incorporate individual level data in a multilevel framework. © 2023 elsevier ltd"
"the conventional net zero perspective with its emphasis on environmental, social and governance (esg) metrics represents linear cause-and-effect thinking. that is, implementation of the metrics will then change company behaviour with the eventual effect of a successful net zero transition. different perspectives are presented, rooted in systems thinking. numerous company examples explain why innovation, not esg metrics, will be the prime mover in achieving net zero. the crux of the argument for systems thinking is that a company like honeywell, currently given an ‘f’ esg score, is delivering stellar innovations that will enable its customers to significantly reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. as to behaviour, boards of directors should demand new information from management with particular attention to returns on capital versus the cost of capital under scenarios that include a price (tax) on carbon. the integration of corporate finance principles with systems thinking will improve decision-making and facilitate an efficient net zero transition. © 2022 the author. systems research and behavioral science published by international federation for systems research and john wiley & sons ltd."
"research in behavioral finance has shown that holidays affect investor sentiment, which in turn affects stock market returns and stock prices. these studies have focused on the relationship between holidays and stock prices and stock market returns, but little attention has been paid to how investor sentiment actually changes during holidays. this paper investigates the dispositional effects of holidays on investor sentiment using social media messages from stock market investors and natural language processing techniques. we analyze the changes in investor sentiment that occur during holidays by using trading hours as a control sample and holidays as a treatment sample. the results of the study indicate that the stock market moves from the trading session into any form of holiday period, leading to an elevation in investor sentiment, demonstrating the therapeutic effect of holidays on investor sentiment. however, the therapeutic effect of holidays on investor sentiment diminishes as the holiday proceeds and manifests a hygienic effect. the hygienic effect of holidays on investor sentiment is evidenced by the fact that they do not significantly boost investor sentiment, but they can maintain a certain level of investor sentiment. this study has important implications for people's understanding of holidays in the stock market as well as for stock market policy making. © 2023 the author(s)"
"purpose: the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of financial education workshops (fews) on parent–adolescent communication about money by controlling for a parent's gender. design/methodology/approach: this study utilized a pre- and post-survey-based experimental research design for impact evaluation. assuming that parents often claim that they frequently communicate with their children about money, the researcher asked children to rate their perception of their mothers' financial communication with them. their mothers completed the pre-survey before agreeing to participate in fews. a follow-up survey was conducted for both study groups six months after completing the few series. the data consisted of 300 responses on 19 pairs of money communication items from both study groups. neither the mothers nor the children were aware that data were collected from both the groups. findings: the results of the paired t-tests support the notion that financial education enhances monetary communication between mothers and adolescents. research limitations/implications: this study is helpful to policymakers and financial educators not only to understand the need for “family-based financial education workshops” but also to design and implement such programs to open up the line of “money communication” between parents and children. social implications: this important outcome provides a likely assumption that the enhancement in communication that had been previously constrained by factors such as a “parent's inability or unwillingness to discuss financial matters” is improved by empowering the parent on the subject of personal finance. second, financial educators and policymakers need to understand that parents play a crucial role in the socialization process of their children. parents' instructions and communications with their children not only impact the children's financial choices but also make them feel more competent about managing their finances. so, importance of financial socialization strategies should be included in the fews designed for the adults. originality/value: existing research studies evaluated the few outcomes by reporting a positive change in various financial behaviors of the participants by considering only one unit of the household. this study extends the impact evaluation of fews to measure the behavioral outcomes at the household level by considering two units of the household, the mother parent and adolescent child by studying their communication about money. © 2022, emerald publishing limited."
"reinforcement learning algorithms describe how an agent can learn an optimal action policy in a sequential decision process, through repeated experience. in a given environment, the agent policy provides him some running and terminal rewards. as in online learning, the agent learns sequentially. as in multi-armed bandit problems, when an agent picks an action, he can not infer ex-post the rewards induced by other action choices. in reinforcement learning, his actions have consequences: they influence not only rewards, but also future states of the world. the goal of reinforcement learning is to find an optimal policy – a mapping from the states of the world to the set of actions, in order to maximize cumulative reward, which is a long term strategy. exploring might be sub-optimal on a short-term horizon but could lead to optimal long-term ones. many problems of optimal control, popular in economics for more than forty years, can be expressed in the reinforcement learning framework, and recent advances in computational science, provided in particular by deep learning algorithms, can be used by economists in order to solve complex behavioral problems. in this article, we propose a state-of-the-art of reinforcement learning techniques, and present applications in economics, game theory, operation research and finance. © 2021, the author(s), under exclusive licence to springer science+business media, llc, part of springer nature."
"there is a void in the health promotion literature concerning the role of health insurance. this study offers a comparative analysis of employee health insurance in the united states and the philippines. as the first study of its kind, it examines insurance as an instrument of health promotion policy for improving population health and reducing healthcare costs. the following questions guide this study: (i) how has insurance coverage of employee healthcare in these two countries evolved and changed over time, and why? (ii) what factors incentivize payers (employers and insurers) to incorporate health promotion into their health plans, even if health promotion does not fall within the traditional ambit of insurance? and (iii) how does health promotion through the insurance vehicle operate cost-efficiently and within the global health promotion framework of the world health organization (who)? us and philippine public-use datasets were gathered and disaggregated to address these questions. the affordable care act (aca) in the us and universal healthcare legislation leading to the universal healthcare act (uhc) in the philippines initiated major paradigmatic shifts in insurance coverage. health literacy, behavioral change and social equity are objectives pursued in both countries by mandating and/or nudging payers to offer health screenings, wellness and fitness programs and primary preventive and diagnostic services. by providing a means to finance access to promotive health and encourage individual responsibility for risk prevention ('healthism'), insurance influences social attitudes about health. however, our findings indicate that outcomes and relative success vary depending on a country's insurance environment, its regulation and the economic, political and socio-cultural forces that affect or shape it (e.g. private markets vs. multi-payer system). contextual realities also drive incentives and rewards to payers and users of promotive health benefits against the backdrop of financial risk or exposure. © 2023 the author(s)."

"this paper intends to contribute to the literature on the determinants of exchange rate fluctuations. we build an agent-based model inspired by the literature on behavioral finance and by empirical surveys about the behavior of foreign exchange professionals. in our artificial economy, traders allocate their wealth across heterogeneous assets based on expectations about exchange and interest rate fluctuations. fundamentalists use both fundamental and technical signals, but overweight the former, while chartists only employ technical signals, and are either trend followers or trend contrarians. each class of traders represents a fixed share of total traders. we find that the simultaneous co-existence of heterogeneous strategies can explain most stylized facts of foreign exchange markets, despite the absence of short-run switching from less to more profitable rules. moreover, contrary to the predictions of the market selection hypothesis, we find that heterogeneity of expectations is an essential requirement for traders’ profitability, as no class of traders can dominate the market profitably. © 2023, the author(s), under exclusive licence to springer-verlag gmbh germany, part of springer nature."

"how the market incorporates information into stock price is a core issue in finance. this study focuses on the impact of economic policy uncertainty (epu) on the stock prices information efficiency of china's a-share market and underlying role of investors' attention allocation mechanism. this study analyzes the information efficiency of stock prices using the sensitivity of stock cumulative abnormal return to earnings information across different windows following earnings announcement. based on the earnings announcement events of listed companies in china's a-share market, this study presents an empirical study of the aforementioned issues using event study and regression analysis methods. the following results are seen: (1) epu aggravates the underreaction of stock price earnings information and the post-earnings announcement drift in the a-share market. (2) under highly uncertain economic policies, investors show a limited attention allocation pattern of devoting increasing attention to macroeconomic policies and decreasing attention to earnings information, which leads to a decrease in the information efficiency of stock price. this study also analyzes the heterogeneity of the influence of epu on stock price information efficiency using the institutional shareholding ratio. the results show that increasing institutional shareholding does not reduce the adverse effects of epu on the information efficiency of stock prices. this study not only provides empirical evidence for brunnermeier, sockin, and xiong (2022) and rational inattention theory, but also reveals that institutional investors show similar behavioral characteristics to retail investors in china's stock market. the results of this study have policy significance for improving the information efficiency of stock market. © 2023 elsevier inc."

"the mandelbrot set is a pattern of sustainability found in nature. each system is based on a certain set. the chapter explores the self-sustaining power of systems in the field of behavioral finance and asset management. an investment portfolio (as a set of elements) functions as a system, so the question arises: can there be a self-sustaining financial portfolio? the chapter raises this question when it adapts the pattern of natural sustainability in the area of individual and social self-care. the principle of correct simplification makes the infinite complexity of the mandelbrot set measurable by setting up its model on an interdisciplinary basis. in the case of the mandelbrot set, it is an infinite form, and its correct simplification to an applicable extent does not seem to be such a self-evident task. especially since the mandelbrot set does not allow for simplifications; it is a simulation of coded growth patterns emerging in nature. this shape can be understood as nothing more than a dynamic model of natural growth. it is a code that is in everything in the form that makes up our world. the code of self-development is an inner force that does not give direction; it only gives form to growth. when researching self-sufficiency, it provides the right form of dynamic feedback that can lead to conclusions with its practical setting values, and which can be used from now on to create a model statement in the closer field of science.the research synthesis is based on systems theory and results in a model concept that can be easily adapted and serves alternatives. the mandelbrot set paradoxically proves its infinite existence by imposing a limit. since this particular mathematical form is an infinite and rather ""irregular"" shape, its accurate measurement is impossible using classical geometry. the research resorted to a heuristic procedure to eliminate this problem. the developed rolling nuts model has universal properties, which also makes it applicable to other sciences. the chapter demonstrates selfsufficiency in the field of profitability, larding practical results to try the impossible: to present for science a passively profitable, self-sustaining model/procedure that provides financial sustainability. the ability to self-sustain is an increasingly burning challenge for our time, not only on an individual but also on a social level. by simplifying the infinitely patterned set, this chapter offers a symmetry that may even be suitable for automatisms in the field of passive profitability. this mechanism can have a beneficial effect on the individual level and institutional level and social care systems. © 2023 nova science publishers, inc."
"the covid-19 outbreak has rapidly affected global economies and the parties involved. there was a need to ensure the sustainability of corporate finance and avoid bankruptcy. the reactions of individuals were not routine, but covered a wide range of approaches to surviving the crisis. a creative way of accounting was also adopted. this study is primarily concerned with the behavior of businesses in the visegrad four countries between 2019 and 2021. the pandemic era was the driving force behind the renaissance of manipulation. thus, the purpose of the article is to explore how the behavior of enterprises changed during the ongoing pandemic. the beneish model was applied to reveal creative manipulation in the analyzed samples. its m-score was calculated for 6113 slovak, 153 czech, 585 polish, and 155 hungarian enterprises. increasing numbers of handling enterprises were confirmed in the v4 region. the dependency between the size of the enterprise and the occurrence of creative accounting was also proven. however, the structure of manipulators has been changing. correspondence analysis specifically showed behavioral changes over time. correspondence maps demonstrate which enterprises already used creative accounting before the pandemic in 2019. then, it was noted that enterprises were influenced to modify their patterns in 2020 and 2021. the coronavirus pandemic had a significant potency on the use of creative accounting, not only for individual units, but for businesses of all sizes. in addition, the methodology may be applied for the investigation of individual sectors post-covid. © 2023 by the authors."
"purpose: the main purpose of this study is to propose an islamic model of human behavioral analysis that can explain the determinants such as islamic moral values, internal factors (e.g. self-efficacy or reasons for and against), external factors (e.g. perceived social support or others from external sources) and empathy (emp) (humane attitude) to predict niyyah (worshipful intention) toward actual behavior (a’mal) in question. design/methodology/approach: with this end in mind, this research uses the theory of islamic entrepreneurship and behavioral reasoning theory as their theoretical foundations. to validate the model, the study uses empirical data on investors’ intention toward sukuk (islamic bonds or shari’ah-compliant bonds) purchase in the context of bangladesh, where very recently the sukuk were introduced by the central bank. findings: findings of the study indicate that islamic values and internal factors have the highest effects on external factors and emp, respectively. internal factors and islamic values have moderate and almost similar impacts on emp. besides, external factors and emp have somewhat equally moderate effects on niyyah. islamic moral values and internal factors have the least influence on internal factors and niyyah, respectively. the external factor is also found to be insignificant to influence emp. the findings also indicate that emp, internal control factors and external control factors have mediating effects on niyyah toward sukuk purchase. research limitations/implications: these results imply that the present research model successfully predicts and explains the determinants of islamic worshipful intention toward the actual purchase of sukuk. practical implications: sukuk has been an important islamic financial instrument that has been growing much rapidly in recent times. so, this paper will help to comprehend that pattern empirically. social implications: islamic finance has emerged as a dominant financial tool nowadays. this paper contributes to advance that initiative one step further in terms of social and economic development. originality/value: this is a conceptual paper written in the area of islamic finance. this model has been validated by collating primary data collected from the selected respondents residing in bangladesh. © 2022, emerald publishing limited."
"purpose: this paper aims to investigate the impact of qualified audit opinions on the returns of stocks listed at amman stock exchange (ase) after the introduction of the recent amendments by the international auditing and assurance standard board (iaasb) on audits reporting and conclusions. it further investigates if results differ between first time qualified and sequenced qualifications, and between plain qualified opinion and qualifications with going concern. design/methodology/approach: audit opinions’ announcements and stock returns data are collected from companies’ annual reports for the fiscal years 2016 to 2019 while stock returns are computed from stock closing prices published at ase website. the authors apply the event study approach and use the market model to calculate normal returns. cumulative abnormal returns (cars) and average abnormal returns (aars) are computed for all qualified audit opinions’ announcements. findings: the empirical evidence suggests that investors at ase do not react to qualified audit opinions announcements. that is, the authors find an insignificant impact of qualified audit opinion announcements on stock returns using both car and aar estimates. the results are robust to first time and sequenced qualifications, and for qualifications with going concern. results are also robust to the use of risk adjusted market model. research limitations/implications: the insignificant impact of qualified audit opinions on stock returns have two potential conflicting research implications. first, the new amendments introduced to auditors’ report made them more informative and reduce the negative signals contained in the qualified opinions. that is, investors are now aware of the real causes of qualifications and not overreacting to the qualified opinion. second, the documented insignificant impact confirms that ase is not a semi-strong form efficient. practical implications: the apparent excessive use of qualifications should ring the bell on whether auditors misuse their power or companies are really in trouble. hence, the jordanian regulatory bodies need to warn auditors against the excessive use of qualifications on the one hand, and to raise the awareness of investors on the implications of auditors’ opinions on the other hand. originality/value: this study is innovative in twofold. first, it explores the impact of qualified audit opinions on stock returns after the introduction of new amendments by iaasb at ase. in addition, it uses event study approach and distinguishes between first time qualified and sequenced qualifications, and between plain qualified opinion and qualifications with going concern. the results are consistent with efficient market theory and behavioral finance explanations. © 2021, emerald publishing limited."
"the framework of this paper is behavioral finance and, more specifically, the analysis of the main anomalies (delay, magnitude and sign effects) present in the processes of intertemporal choice. to the extent of our knowledge, only the delay effect (also known as decreasing impatience) has been discriminated between moderately and strongly decreasing impatience. however, taking into account that anomalies must be explained from a psychological point of view, the main objective of this paper is to relate the aforementioned paradoxes with the four categories of temperaments (artisan, guardian, idealist and rational) by using the sixteen personality types derived from the myers–briggs type indicator and the behavioral investor types. to do this, we will use the analytic hierarchy process methodology in order to detect the different levels of impatience through the so-called hyperbolic factor. indeed, the main contribution of this paper refers to an empirical application which complements the theoretical analysis. © 2022, the author(s), under exclusive licence to springer-verlag gmbh germany, part of springer nature."
"in this study, we provide empirical evidence on the relative impact of energy market sentiments on the stock and esg index returns in the u.s. and gulf cooperation council (gcc) economies. specifically, we study movements in four distinct categories of energy sentiments (natural gas, crude oil, rbob gasoline, and heating oil) displayed by professional investors and investigate their relative impact on esg investments and stock returns in the u.s. and gcc economies. we employ the recently developed automatic time series forecasting methodology autometrics to examine the postulated relationships. the results of the regression models suggest that there is a significant negative impact of stock sentiments and a positive impact of energy sentiments on the s&p 500 returns. however, in the case of the u.s. energy companies’ returns, there are significantly higher effects of only energy market sentiments (mainly crude oil and rbob gasoline). in the case of the gcc stock markets, there are significant positive impacts of crude oil sentiments and the s&p 500 of varying degrees of strength. the most significant impact of crude oil sentiments is observed in uae and saudi arabia and is almost of the same magnitude as those on the u.s. energy companies’ returns. these results are consistent with arguments provided in behavioral finance studies that investors prefer bigger profits over social returns during bullishness and step back from social investing when better investment opportunities are available. also, esg investing may be preferred during bearishness by utilitarian investors to generate abnormal returns during such lean periods. © 2023, econjournals. all rights reserved."
"purpose: this study aims to determine the non-economic factors that probably influence the pakistani farmers to use islamic finance for agricultural production. this paper analyzes the other religiosity and familial leadership constructs in the standard theory of planned behavior (tpb) model from the islamic banking perspective. design/methodology/approach: data were collected from 233 farmers using snowball sampling techniques and partial least square structural equation modeling used for data analysis. an additional qualitative analysis was conducted of seven respondents through semi-structured interviews to deepen into knowledge about islamic banking. findings: the findings demonstrate that attitude, subjective norms, religiosity and familial leadership to use islamic banking among the farmers play a primary motivating role in manipulating their behavioral intentions to use it. however, pbc negatively affected the behavior of farmers to use islamic banking. practical implications: this study highlights the importance of emotional attachment between the farmers and islamic financial products according to shariah law. therefore, islamic banks need effective strategies for the development of innovative products in the agricultural sector according to the shariah principle. originality/value: the research contributes to the area of islamic banking, demonstrating that “familial leadership” significantly influences an individual’s behavior toward decision-making to use islamic finance. © 2022, emerald publishing limited."
"an ontology of the financial field can support effective association and integration of financial knowledge. based on behavioral finance, social media is increasingly applied as one of the data sources for information fusion in stock forecasting to approximate the patterns of market changes. by predicting tesla (tsla) stock price trends, this study finds that satisfactory forecasting results can be achieved using classical models and incorporating key information features from the technical indicator ontology class and the investor behavior ontology class, even in the face of the impact of the covid-19 epidemic. in the post-epidemic period, the back propagation neural network (bpnn) model is used to predict the price trend of tsla for the next five trading days with an accuracy of up to 91.34%, an f1 score of 0.91, and a return of up to 268.42% obtained from simulated trading. this study extends the research on stock forecasting using fused information in the ontology of the financial field, providing a new basis for general investors in the selection of fusion information and the application of trading strategies and providing effective support for organizations to make intelligent financial decisions under uncertainty.  © 2023 copyright held by the owner/author(s). publication rights licensed to acm."
"behavioral finance has uncovered that investor engage emotionally when trading. we investigate how three psychological factors influence purchase and repurchase decisions: representativeness, the influence of prior gains, and reference points. using trading data of 7200 uk investors we find that purchase decisions are influenced by representative heuristic and repurchase decisions are influenced by both representative heuristic and prior profitability. further survival analysis showed that investors use the prior selling price as a unique reference point. investors are more likely to repurchase a stock when trading above its reference point, but more likely to initiate the repurchase when trading below. investors are influenced by previous experience and engage learning behavior when they seek to reinforce past success. as reference points are inferred but infrequently researched, this research adds to the literature and provides important and robust results for those engaging with financial planning clients. © 2022 the authors. international review of finance published by john wiley & sons australia, ltd on behalf of international review of finance ltd."
"purpose: behavioral finance proposes that psychology of the individual plays a vital role in investment decisions. therefore, this study aims to examine the influence of one of the important disciplines of psychology, i.e. personality on investment decision-making by incorporating financial satisfaction as an intervening variable and gender as a moderator. design/methodology/approach: the data of 406 valid responses were collected through structured questionnaires from individual investors of indian stock market and analyzed using structural equation modeling. several invariance tests were also conducted to perform the multigroup analysis of gender on the mediated model. findings: the results revealed that extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness and neuroticism significantly influence investment decision-making through financial satisfaction. while financial satisfaction significantly mediates the indirect relationships between personality traits and investment decision-making for both males and females, no significant differences among males and females were found in the mediated model. research limitations/implications: the current study covers a limited geographical area of north india. in addition to this, it is cross-sectional in nature and incorporates only limited factors for predicting investment decisions. practical implications: the study possesses numerous significant implications for financial practitioners, advisors, investors, academicians and researchers in the field of behavioral finance. originality/value: this study suggests a moderated mediation approach, which incorporates financial satisfaction as a mediator and gender as a moderator. to the best of the authors’ knowledge, so far, no study has been conducted in this context, and it will enhance the understanding of investment decisions of individual investors. © 2023, emerald publishing limited."
"green finance and investment in renewable energy (re) projects can contribute to the reduction of climate change and the achievement of sustainable development goals (sdgs). in such projects, households can be contributive in increasing the investment level. to assess the determinants of households' investment intention in re projects, the theory of planned behavior (tpb) model was extended according to the existing literature on green finance and investment. the primary data was collected from iranian households (n = 280) using random sampling through structured questionnaire interviews. according to the analyses conducted using structural equation modeling (sem) and amos software, attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, evaluation of the regulatory framework (erf), perceived risk, and perceived usefulness of power purchase agreements (ppas) significantly influence households' intentions to invest in re projects. the results indicated that perceived risk is influenced by erf, whereas investment attitudes are influenced by subjective norms and perceived risk. in addition to providing theoretical insights, this study provides empirical findings that can assist policymakers in the process of enabling households to invest in re projects. according to the study's policy recommendations, the government, financial institutions, and social media should contribute to encouraging households to participate in green finance and investment. © 2023 elsevier ltd"
"a financial system is a set of institutions, such as banks, insurance companies, and stock exchanges, that permit the exchange of funds. financial systems exist on firm, regional, and global levels. borrowers, lenders, and investors exchange current funds to finance projects, either for consumption or productive investments, and to pursue a return on their financial assets. the financial system also includes sets of rules and practices that borrowers and lenders use to decide which projects get financed, who finances projects, and terms of financial deals. the concept of ""internal control"" conveys a difficult and complex process. different countries have different interpretations of the internal control system, and in accordance with their tradition use different methods, techniques and philosophies for its implementation.the financial system of our economy, although it must be acknowledged that it is not very modern and developed, is still quite complex. in support of a complete system with all components, there is a need for harmonized investment in many directions at once. financial crises and stock market crashes have clearly demonstrated the impact of investors’ sentiment on asset pricing and stock markets’ efficiency. herd behavior, which is behavioral similarity based on individuals’ interaction that leads to convergence of action and correlated trading (hirshleifer and teoh, 2003), is one of the most important behavioral biases that is more likely to occur during periods of market stress when individual investors prefer to follow the market consensus, being reluctant to follow their own knowledge or beliefs (christie and huang, 1995). management on all levels must have full confidence in the integrity and independence of the audit process. financial system, audit and corporate governance (cg) has come to the forefront of academic research due to the vital role it plays in the overall health of economic systems. the wave of u.s. corporate fraud in the 1990s was attributed to deficiencies in corporate governance. the recent 2008-2009 global financial crisis, triggered by the unprecedented failure of lehman brothers and the subprime mortgage problems, renewed interest on the role of corporate governance in the financial sector. the main purpose of this scientific paper is to study financial situation, audit and governance and strategies for optimizing investment, concretelly in the albanian financial environment. © 2023, srac - romanian society for quality. all rights reserved."
"purpose: the current study aims to achieve two targets. first, examine empirically that whether corporate managers use tax avoidance to influence short-term profitability? second, investigate the impact of tax avoidance on the value of firms. the tax accounts provide the opportunity to influence temporary/permanent profitability but empirical studies overlooking this matter, particularly in emerging economies. design/methodology/approach: first, the authors identified unexpected fluctuations of tax avoidance and then examine whether it impacts the profitability signal and firms' value? the unbalanced panel data of 189 non-financial firms for the period 2000–2018 are used for empirical analysis. the estimation biases and results consistency are verified by using two different econometric models including generalized least square and two-stage least square findings: the study identifies that managers manipulate the profitability signal through tax avoidance. tax avoidance practices help in earning management and earning smoothing to avoid negative signals in the stock market. in line with the behavioral finance view, tax avoidance has a positive impact on current stock returns because investors focus on profitability without a detailed screening of cash flows. originality/value: a limited number of studies investigate the use of tax avoidance for manipulation of the short-term earning signal. identifying gaps and limitations in the literature, this study provides invaluable insights into tax avoidance and its association with the profitability and value of firms. the findings are important for investors, managers and policymakers in making portfolio decisions and corporate policies. © 2021, emerald publishing limited."
"aim: process evaluations for social and behavioral interventions are increasingly important as interventions become more complex and multi-faceted. conducting process evaluations in low-resource international settings can be challenging. process evaluations in low-resource international settings can help inform and improve the quality of ongoing intervention implementation. we conducted a process evaluation of a cluster-randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of a microfinance and health leadership program on sexually transmitted infections and intimate partner violence perpetration among young men in tanzania. subject and methods: our trial included 1491 participants and the intervention lasted 2 years. we collected process data on microfinance loan uptake and repayment, and health leaders’ health conversations with peers to monitor intervention reach and dose received. we developed a database system that allowed offline data collection and synced to a central database when internet was accessible. research staff in the usa accessed data from the central database to analyze and create regular implementation reports. results: process graphical reports facilitated identification of implementation challenges and enabled us to resolve issues before they worsened. for example, from a group with low microfinance loan repayment we learned area participants perceived the loan to be a grant, and then we clarified the misinformation with participants. conclusions: the process evaluation helped inform ongoing intervention implementation, including approaches to improve reach and uptake of interventions. field staff time was protected by systemizing the sharing of data processing and analyses across the global team. © 2021, the author(s), under exclusive licence to springer-verlag gmbh germany, part of springer nature."
"facing the need for green investment and financing brought about by the process of “carbon neutrality”, more and more leaders of commercial banks have begun to initiate green transformation of their enterprises and become green bankers with green finance awareness and vision, while their subordinate green investment and financing teams, as executive units with complementary green finance knowledge, skills, information, and expertise, have become a key link in the bank’s green investment and financing management. relying on structuration theory and using the multi-case study method, this research analyzes how green bankers promote the behavioral integration of green investment and financing teams from the perspective of team structure construction and deconstructs the process of transforming the development vision of green bankers into green investment and financing practices. through a pairing study of eight commercial banks, it was found that green bankers can build a green investment and financing team structure to promote their behavioral integration through resources and rules. there are six effective strategies in the construction behavior, including: building a consensus on green finance strategy within the enterprise; guiding the green investment and financing team to exploratively learn green finance knowledge; facilitating collaboration across positions; implementing a fair “result-oriented” salary structure; granting rights to subordinate employees who are competent for green investment and financing tasks; and building a job division and operation mechanism with clear responsibilities. finally, suggestions are put forward to improve the salary system of green bankers, optimize the training system of green financial talents, and use digital management to ensure the independent authority of green investment and financing positions. © 2023 by the authors."

"since the concept of “nudge” was introduced in 2008 by thaler and sunstein, proposing that small interventions based on changes in choice architectures can alter people’s behavior and make it easier for them to achieve their desired goals, the application in public policy of behavioral economics has gained significant attention. this has led to the emergence of different types of policies based on behavioral insights, which have been used in a variety of areas, including health or finance, with the goal of promoting well-being and addressing social and economic issues. after providing a basic theoretical background as a frame of reference to understand gender violence, this study explores the use of tools from the field of behavioral economics as it is applied in public policy. regulatory (paternalistic) and non-regulatory (libertarian) interventions based on behavioral insights will be considered: nudges, boosts, shoves, budges, or sludge audits, are examined as potential interventions to use in matters related to this type of violence. after evaluating these behavioral policy instruments and their potential effectiveness, the limitations of the behavioral perspective are recognized, and the need for a multifaceted approach to combating gender violence is acknowledged. the article concludes by arguing that public policies addressing gender violence should not only utilize behavioral tools but should also incorporate strategies related to education, legislation, and social norms. © 2023, universidad politécnica salesiana, ecuador."
"purpose: this paper aims to survey literature on behavioral economics and finance, with particular emphasis on a selection of models, methods and tools that this strand of thought uses to approach and explain observable phenomena. design/methodology/approach: after a brief discussion on the meaning and context of behavioral economics, the manuscript identifies five topics of special interest: time preference, heuristics, emotions, finance and macro behavior. for each of these topics, relevant models, methods and tools are identified and scrutinized. findings: behavioral economics and finance establish an effective bridge between orthodox economic thinking and new and revolutionary methods of analysis. exploring the intricacies of human behavior can frequently be done by adapting the trivial and conventional intertemporal utility maximization models that economists insistently resort to, but to fully grasp such intricacies, a step forward is required. agent-based models and other tools from complexity sciences constitute the analytical arsenal that is needed to improve our understanding of how behavioral issues attach to heterogeneity, local interaction, path-dependence, out-of-equilibrium dynamics and emergence. originality/value: although surveys on behavioral economics and finance abound in the specialized literature, this study has the peculiarity of emphasizing five relevant topics that are particularly illustrative of the pivotal role of behavioral science in promoting the transition from the strict neoclassical perspective to a less mechanic and more organic view of economics and finance. © 2022, emerald publishing limited."
"we estimate the relationship between high-temperature exposure and land transaction using daily transaction data from 2013 to 2018 in china. standard hedonic price method is used to perform multidimensional fixed effects regression on 458,564 transaction samples. this study shows that each additional day of the extremely high temperature increases the average bid price by 0.6%, which is equivalent to an additional annual increase of 15.018 billion yuan in land transaction costs. the effect of high temperature on land prices is considerably stronger for residential and commercial lands. we further find that high-temperature-induced changes of mood and cognition play a role. extreme gradient boosting (xgboost) algorithm is used to calculate price deviation, which overcome missing eigenvalues and reduce nonlinear measurement error. our findings indicate that heat can make investors more aggressive, which occurs when bidders continue to raise prices to win. the number of bidding behavior will not drop due to the hidden costs of land transactions. specially, bidding experience offsets the cognitive output bias. this study contributes to the behavioral finance and decision-making literature, helps investors make better investment management decisions, and alleviates the negative effect of land transaction premium on the real estate market. © 2023 the authors. earth's future published by wiley periodicals llc on behalf of american geophysical union."

"purpose: this paper aims to provide a multidisciplinary framework that allows an integrated understanding of reasons of success or failure in equity crowdfunding (ecf), a fintech digital innovation of the traditional entrepreneurial finance, defining a future research agenda. design/methodology/approach: a systematic literature review (slr) has been conducted on 127 documents extracted from two multidisciplinary repositories (elsevier’s scopus and clarivate analytics web of science) for the period between 2015 and early 2022. after a systematized series of inclusion and exclusion criteria, in line with the objectives and conceptual boundaries, a final list of 32 peer-reviewed articles written in english was analyzed by the authors through a meta-synthesis and thematic analysis to identify the key themes and dominant concepts. findings: results show that the body of literature is recent and fast growing. the proposed integrative framework of existing research indicates that the outcome of an ecf campaign is related to signals conveyed by entrepreneurs in the form of hard information (firm characteristics, financial information, business characteristics and project description) and soft information (intellectual capital, human capital, social capital and social media network), catalyzed by digital media that facilitate also personal interactions between entrepreneurs and investors. similarly, external factors (investors and campaign characteristics, with the fundamental role of ecf platform managers in building trust between entrepreneurs and investors) allow for the alleviation of information asymmetries. the present study sheds light on which signal mechanisms are decisive in improving the outcome, taking into consideration various disciplines which follow different but complementary perspectives. practical implications: entrepreneurs should adapt to the transition toward the digital era, exploiting alternative financial instruments and learning effective signaling strategies, within a large variety of skills requested. platform managers can obtain more focused information on selected entrepreneurial projects more efficiently. originality/value: although it is fast-growing, the field of research is very recent, still fragmented and limited to the perspective/discipline followed. this slr is, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, the first multidisciplinary and integrative analysis of reasons that motivates success, or failure, of an equity-based crowdfunding campaign. the digital nature of ecf encourages future research to move toward more pioneering and unconventional theories and research methods. hence, the authors add to the existing literature by proposing future patterns of research based on an integration of highly technological skills and behavioral/psychological approaches. © 2022, francesco james mazzocchini and caterina lucarelli."
"purpose: financial theory is based on the assumption of rationality of individuals. defenders of behavioral finance recommend that the rationality hypothesis of efficiency theory is too narrow and irrelevant (barberis and thaler, 2002). the irrationality of the investor is reflected in his choice and his behaviour. however, his choice depends on the way the problem is formulated and described. the irrational investor does not think in terms of final wealth but rather in terms of gains and losses. design/methodology/approach: this research is interested in the methods of classification of the investors in homogeneous groups. in the study, the classification method used to group individual in the sample is the dynamic aggregation method. however, to identify the number of groups to use in this method, the authors also used the hierarchical method on a sub-sample. thus, to this end the authors present a topological analysis to test the hypothesis of the heterogeneity of tunisian investor groups in terms of belief. findings: the results suggest that the majority of investors are quite irrational. therefore, the tunisian investor considers itself irrational because of the presence of several anomalies in its behavior. originality/value: this research proposes to help identify the variables that are truly determining in the process of interpreting information. the authors wish to formulate recommendations for the use of information, in order to help professionals and investors in the orientation of the investment strategy. in particular, the authors attempt to indicate the variables to which attention should be paid. in addition, behavioral financial analysis is useful for investors. thus, taking into account certain irrational phenomena is important to make a decision. in addition, it allows to better identify the investor's own shortcomings and to detect certain negative trends. © 2022, emerald publishing limited."

"this paper aims to investigate market participants' reactions to sequential information, presenting firm-specific news and market-wide information. experimental study takes place in the covid-19 pandemic era, as market-wide information representation. we also provide firm-specific information in the form of company fundamental information. the results show that participants, as representatives of retail investors, do not overreact to covid-19. the recency effect dominates their decision-making. neither firm-specific information nor market-wide information can eliminate the recency effect in decision making. investors still provide valuations based on the latest information they receive. another interesting finding in this study is that positive framing of information cannot mitigate the effects of bad news contained therein. our findings contribute to the study of behavioral finance and corporate disclosure strategies. from the market participants' point of view, our results describe that investors' decisions are often not based on the information content but the latest information they received. from the company perspective, this research also contributes to the corporate disclosure strategy valued by investors based on how they disclose information to the public. © 2023, university of economics and human sciences in warsaw. all rights reserved."
"behavioral intentions of individuals occur as a result of positive or negative evaluations of any object or idea. it is a determinant that has a significant impact on transforming an individual's ideas into behavior. the structure and effectiveness of information in financial markets are vital to understanding the behavior of investors, because the digital economy that develops with crypto money is psychologically significantly different from the cash economy. accordingly, this study examined the main intentions or motivational factors that persuade individuals to invest in cryptocurrencies and the way these factors affect the actual investment behavior. this was done in the context of behavioral considerations in finance through the unified technology acceptance model (utaut). as a result of the model estimation, it has been concluded that the performance expectation is an important factor behind the investment behavior, and its effect changes considering positive or negative news about the pricing of cryptocurrencies. © 2023 university of tehran, college of farabi. all rights reserved."

"this paper provides a new approach to understanding bankers' risk-taking behavior. we build upon prior studies that suggest artificial intelligence algorithms are an effective approach to obtaining this understanding. our approach uses behavioral finance and a unique decision-making model. although the decision-making literature is replete with descriptions and explanations of creditors and investors' perceptions and judgment, it does not provide an algorithmic model that incorporates a more flexible approach to how creditors subjectively valuate risky projects. specifically, a model is presented where 33 corporate bankers realized ex ante that they were unable to accurately model the underlying uncertainty that characterizes a company's need for a loan. the results indicate that bankers' risk assessments result in different evaluations of financial information regarding loans. this approach depicts an integrative algorithmic modelling process, whereby limits in the amount of historical conditional information prohibit the use of more complex econometric techniques. © 2023 the authors"
"the growth of the metaverse is an imminent phenomenon for the world to tap its economic opportunities. non-fungible token (nft) is the choice of a new form of financial technology in metaverse to authenticate digital asset ownership. the objective of this study was to examine the impacts of nft on the metaverse communities. based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model, the sample was financial users in the metaverse who are familiar with nft. the findings validated that utaut constructs influence the intention to use nft payments. also, self-efficacy was confirmed as the antecedent to explain the need for managing the processes while payments were made. this study provides an understanding of the use of nft by examining the theoretical aspect of the current usage scenario in the metaverse. furthermore, the required personal ability of the users in determining the benefits of nft offers practical consideration for wider adoption. hence, it contributes to the research on the behavioral finance aspect of nft usage. © 2023 by igi global. all rights reserved."
"the theoretical debate between traditional economics and behavioral economics centers on the extent to which human decision-making is influenced by rationality versus psychological biases. behavioral economics posits that decision-making is affected by a range of factors, including psychology, which limit rationality. the framing effect is one such factor, whereby the presentation of information in either a positive or negative manner can influence decision-making. this study aims to explore the extent to which the framing effect influences decision-making. to this end, an online survey was conducted with 119 students from yildiz technical university’s finance and engineering departments, with the hypothesis that finance students, due to their exposure to rationality theory, would be less influenced by the framing effect compared to engineering students. data collected from the survey were analyzed using frequency tests, chi-square tests, and correlation analysis. the findings reveal that finance students tend to exhibit more rational behavior and are less susceptible to the framing effect compared to their engineering counterparts. © the author(s), under exclusive license to springer nature switzerland ag 2023."

"the objective of this article was to evaluate the relationship between investor attention, both professional and non-professional, and the efficiency of the brazilian stock market, as measured by the predictability of daily returns. the role of investor attention in the capital market is a controversial issue, since some studies show that it is capable of inducing efficiency, while others point out that it essentially contributes to greater volatility due to behavioral biases. this study contributes to the behavioral finance literature by pioneering the analysis of the effect of investor attention on brazilian stock prices. moreover, we found no previous studies that compare the effect of investor attention on market efficiency across investor classes, as measured by access to different financial information providers. the analysis of investor attention, as measured by the volume of searches on the internet, is relevant given the growing abundance of data and digital inclusion. the evidence of an effect of attention on market efficiency contributes to the critique of this classical hypothesis. the methodology consisted of estimating autoregressive models using daily data from 2018 to 2021 on search volume, returns, and transaction volume for brazilian stocks, including the interaction between returns and search volume, to assess the influence of attention on price dynamics. in this work, we find that in the brazilian stock market, investor attention contributes to greater market efficiency, as measured by lower predictability of returns, but the most pronounced effect comes from the attention of nonprofessional investors. understanding how attention affects the incorporation of information into prices contributes to a critique of the market efficiency hypothesis, as well as allowing for profits to be made by exploiting opportunities based on the level of attention of a particular class of investors. © 2023 universidade de sao paulo. museu de zoologia. all rights reserved."
"recommender systems often struggle with the user cold start problem, which arises when there is a lack of interaction data for new users. this issue is particularly important in financial stock recommendations, as novice investors often lack investment experience and require personalized advice more than experienced users. behavioral finance offers valuable insights into investor preferences and highlights the impact of psychological factors on investor behavior. in this paper, we present a novel framework that integrates behavioral finance with financial stock recommendations to effectively tackle the user cold start problem. to that end, we first conduct a survey involving 964 japanese individual investors to gather investment-related behavioral traits while collecting their transaction data in a trading platform. then, we introduce the investor risk-tolerance aware dropoutnet (irad) and show its improved performance over baseline models, demonstrating its effectiveness for stock recommendations in cold start settings. finally, we offer an example of how incorporating investors' behavioral traits can result in more interpretable stock recommendations.  © 2023 ieee."
"this paper applies the cumulative prospect theory to improve the traditional integer subscript hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (is-hflts). the proposed variable subscript hesitant fuzzy language set (vs-hflts) takes into account the subjectivity and differences of investors' behavior when investing in the securities market, and extends the application of behavioral finance to multi-criteria group decision-making portfolio. to evaluate the financial products, the vs-hflts multi-criteria group decision-making portfolio evaluation system is constructed in the research. the hesitant fuzzy linguistic value function and the purchase appetite weight function are proposed to convert the natural linguistic evaluation into a quantitative score for the judgment of future portfolio return in the securities market. furthermore, a variable subscript hesitant fuzzy linguistic portfolio model is put forward for the risk-averse, risk-neutral, and risk-seeking investment decision-makers. the optimal portfolio strategy is obtained by solving the equivalent non-linear model. meanwhile, an optimized group decision-making portfolio strategy is established to better achieve the goal of increasing group decision-making investors' returns or reducing risks. finally, numerical simulations are performed to find effective frontiers for future portfolio selection, which verifies the validity and feasibility of the models and methods proposed in this paper. © 2022, the author(s) under exclusive licence to taiwan fuzzy systems association."

"this paper provides an empirical analysis of the re-introduction of the wealth tax in spain. using the spanish survey of household finance, we employ the difference-in-differences method to estimate the behavioral responses to the re-introduction of the wealth tax in 2011. due to non-compliance, we are able to estimate the intention-to-treat effects which show that, over a six-year period, on average, the wealth tax reduced taxable wealth by about 42% to 51%. to distinguish between real and avoidance responses, we show evidence that part of this reduction could be attributed to portfolio composition shifts in favor of tax-exempt assets. these results could inform policy regarding both the potential of wealth taxation in reducing wealth concentration and inequality, and the loopholes that might undermine it. © 2023 elsevier b.v."
"patients diagnosed with alzheimer's disease and related dementias (adrd) rely on family members, their community, and the health care system for progressively increasing support over the course of their disease. these people receive care through a frequently siloed health care system across hospitals, nursing homes, ambulatory care settings, and long-term care settings, as well as community- and home-based care. as the number of people living with a diagnosis of adrd continues to grow, so does the need to provide better support for these people and their caregivers. the national institute on aging (nia) division of behavioral and social research suggests that organizational behavior change will be needed for health care systems to integrate all of the services and supports required to provide high-quality care for people with adrd. nia sponsored a workshop hosted by the national academies of sciences, engineering, and medicine to explore mechanisms to improve the quality of care for people living with adrd and the potential of innovative payment models to incentivize health care systems to make the necessary systemic changes. the workshop convened a diverse array of experts in fields including nursing, geriatrics, health care economics, health care services research, quality measurement, social work, medical ethics, law, health care finance, and health care policy. this publication summarizes the presentation and discussion of the workshop. © 2022 by the national academy of sciences. all rights reserved."

"in the biometric biomedical applications, the study presents a pioneering research endeavor focused on the development of a multimedia identification and analysis algorithm tailored for piano performance music. with the power of deep learning techniques, this algorithm has been designed to address the intricate challenges posed by the convergence of musical data analysis and biometrics. the core objectives encompass the extraction, recognition, and interpretation of biometric information from piano performances, exploring the intricate patterns, nuances, and individualistic characteristics inherent to musicians. the study focuses on the development of advanced biometric authentication and identification systems capable of capturing and analyzing a user's unique behavioral patterns across diverse modalities. these biometric modalities offer the potential for highly secure and non-intrusive user identification. hence, this paper developed an architecture of marker controlled point (mcp) estimation for the computation of the gesture in biometric-based applications. this architecture utilizes markers or reference points to precisely track and analyze user gestures, resulting in accurate and reliable biometric data. the research details the architecture's implementation, integrating advanced deep-learning techniques for feature extraction, pattern recognition, and authentication. this system finds versatile applications in various domains, from healthcare and cybersecurity to finance, where secure and user-friendly authentication is paramount. experimental results underscore the system's effectiveness and robustness, demonstrating its potential for enhancing biometric authentication. the proposed model represents a significant stride in biometric technology, offering secure, non-intrusive user identification through the synergy of behavior biometrics and emerging modalities. © jes 2023 on-line: journal.esrgroups.org"
"behavioral economics and artificial intelligence (ai) have been two rapidly growing fields of research over the past few years. while behavioral economics aims to combine concepts from psychology, sociology, and neuroscience with classical economic thoughts to understand human decision-making processes in the complex economic environment, ai on the other hand, focuses on creating intelligent machines that can mimic human cognitive abilities such as learning, problem-solving, decision-making, and language understanding. the intersection of these two fields has led to thrilling research theories and practical applications. this study provides a bibliometric analysis of the literature on ai and behavioral economics to gain insight into research trends in this field. we conducted this bibliometric analysis using the web of science database on articles published between 2012 and 2022 that were related to ai and behavioral economics. vosviewer and bibliometrix r package were utilized to identify influential authors, journals, institutions, and countries in the field. network analysis was also performed to identify the main research themes and their interrelationships. the analysis revealed that the number of publications on ai and behavioral economics has been increasing steadily over the past decade. we found that most studies focused on customer and consumer behavior, including topics such as decision-making under uncertainty, neuroeconomics, and behavioral game theory, combined mainly with machine learning and deep learning techniques. we also identified several emerging themes, including the use of ai in nudging and prospect theory in behavioral finance, as well as undeveloped themes such as ai-driven behavioral macroeconomics. the findings suggests that there is a need for more interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers in behavioral economics and ai. we also suggest that future research on ai and behavioral economics further consider the ethical implications of using ai and behavioral insights in decision-making. this study can serve as a valuable resource for researchers interested in ai and behavioral economics.  © 2013 ieee."
"purpose: the authors examine whether the uncertainty avoidance culture and the stringency of government response play a role in shaping the stock market's response to coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). the authors find that investors' response to the pandemic will not only depend on their instinct of uncertainty aversion but also on their expectation about the effectiveness of the government measures. the uncertainty avoidance culture amplifies the irrational actions of investors. however, harsh government responses will weaken this effect. harsh government responses also send a negative signal to the market about the extent of the pandemic and the economic damage caused by anti-covid measures. governments need to be balanced in imposing anti-covid measurements to preserve market confidence. design/methodology/approach: in this article, the authors investigate whether the stock market volatility of emerging countries is simultaneously driven by two factors: the uncertainty-aversion culture of investors in a country and the stringency of the government's response to the pandemic. the authors conduct an empirical study on a sample of 20 emerging countries during the period from january 2020 to march 2021. findings: the authors find that the national-level uncertainty aversion amplifies the irrational actions of investors during the period of crisis. however, harsh government responses will weaken this effect. the authors’ findings show evidence that investors' response to the pandemic will not only depend on their instinct of uncertainty aversion but also on their expectation about the effectiveness of the government measures. although harsh government responses can stabilize the investors' sentiment in countries with high levels of uncertainty aversion, they also send a negative signal to the market about the extent of the pandemic as well as the economic damage caused by anti-covid measures. originality/value: first, the study’s results complement evidence from existing studies on the effect of uncertainty avoidance culture in determining stock market responses to covid-19. second, an important difference from previous studies, this paper adds to the behavioral finance literature by showing that investors' investment decisions in the face of economic uncertainty are not driven solely by their cultural values but also by their expectation about the effectiveness of the government policy. during a crisis, when the market has neither rational information nor adequate experience to forecast the future, the government must play an important role in stabilizing investors' sentiment and reactions. © 2021, emerald publishing limited."

"today’s regime of financialized capitalism requires individuals to engage with financial products and services to ensure their financial security and welfare. within this regime, institutional actors formulate and communicate imaginaries of the future that prompt individuals to embrace particular financial logics, understandings, and practices in managing their personal finance. financial literacy and education is an important institutional field where such imaginaries are formulated and communicated to the public. this article examines the notions and themes articulated in programs of financial education currently conducted by state and non-state organizations in israel, considering the ways in which proper conduct in key financial activities (debt and credit, saving and investment, and insurance) is defined, explained, and justified. we argue that, replete with explicit and implicit references to emotions and emotional states associated with practices of everyday finance, these programs mobilize them to govern individuals’ imaginaries of the future and financial conduct according to the model of the desired responsible financial subject. this emotional dimension represents a significant component in the cultural political economy of the constitution of financial subjectivities and the culture of financialization, that naturalizes the behavioral and dispositional requirements and demands that everyday finance poses to the general public. © the author(s) 2022."

"cryptography is used in applications where subversion of the communication system could lead to financial loss, which is known as financial cryptography. in contrast to classical encryption, which has mostly been utilized for military and diplomatic purposes throughout recorded history, financial cryptography focuses on privacy and security. the techniques and algorithms required for the security of financial transfers as well as the development of new money types are included in financial cryptography. financial cryptography includes proof of work and several auction mechanisms. spam is being restricted by using hashcash. the applications of financial cryptography have been observed to be highly diverse. financial cryptography is incredibly difficult and calls for knowledge from many different, incompatible, or at the very least, hostile disciplines. the higher risk factor that efforts to build financial cryptography systems will reduce or eliminate crucial strategies that they are trapped among financial application and cryptography, or between accountants and programmers. digital finance is playing a big role in how financial services are organized globally. digitalization, data analysis, and increased processing power enable a wide range of new financial services and transactions. the importance of economic development has attracted a lot of attention to this economic development enabled by digital financial technology (fintech). cryptography has begun to expand swiftly in the fintech sector, and both investors and financial bankers are becoming more favorable toward digital assets. the observed market factors are directly related to how people behave when they engage in financial activity. the result analysis in this behavioral strategies of financial cryptography from a specific market analysis is still limited, despite the abundance of research and theories on the underlying motives of people’s behavior in financial frameworks. © the editor(s) (if applicable) and the author(s), under exclusive license to springer nature switzerland ag 2023."

"this study applies time-series analysis to observe investor sentiment in the tourism stock market. we infer that investor sentiment positively affects the capital flows to illustrate the behavioral finance in the tourism stock market. the vector autoregression and autoregressive-moving-average models of time-series analysis are adopted to analyze individual and overall capital flows of herding behavior. the empirical study collected quarterly data on 45 tourism-related stocks in china from 2018 to 2020. results reaffirm that investor sentiment causes irrational investment and strong fluctuations of capital flows, including those during the coronavirus 2019 pandemic. in practice, the overreaction of tourism-related stocks is discovered in the tourism market that requires long-term resilience. theoretically, the rational capital asset pricing model needs adjustments with the sentiment factor based on behavioral finance theory. © 2022 elsevier b.v."
"the formation of market interactions is directly affected by the decision-making of market players. this paper seeks to assess the presence of behavioral finance on the iranian financial market as a factor influ-encing market participants’ decisions. the current study evaluates the existence of behavioral finance on the iranian capital market by focusing on the phenomena of “price clustering” in the total index of the tehran stock exchange. it proposes a new criterion for identifying behavioral bias in the financial market. one of the reasons for the lack of uniformity in the distribution of data in the total index of tehran securities is the propensity of individuals to make individual decisions based on the index of total securities of tehran. people use the total index as a criterion for making decisions, and when the total index reaches round numbers, their purchasing and selling behavior changes. the results of the study validate the phenomena of price clustering in round numbers in tehran’s total stock index. in actuality, the lack of uniform distribution in the total index numbers of tehran stock is an appropriate indicator of the existence of behavioral finance on the tehran stock exchange. the main differentiating aspect of this study is the introduction of the overall index as a new measure compared to individual symbols for demonstrating behavioral bias in the financial market, which has been employed in previous studies. © 2023, erdal karapinar. all rights reserved."
"intertemporal choices play a fundamental role in the lives of individuals, and the discounted utility model is the essential framework for describing decision makers’ attitudes in front of alternatives structured over multiple periods. the classical formulation of the model assumes constant preferences over time, i.e., it assumes that individuals’ choices are consistent. empirical evidence, however, shows that individuals’ preferences do not respond to this assumption, generating temporally inconsistent decisions. this paper addresses the problem of temporal inconsistency in order to interpret and describe anomalous choices, i.e., not rationalizable from a theoretical point of view, through the cognitive distortions of the decision-maker. indeed, even if we assume that the investor is a rational subject, behavioral finance suggests that an anomaly is part of the human being and must be recognized as a systematic condition of the decision-making process. exploiting the relationship between the rate of impatience and temporal preference, this work aims to demonstrate that the degree of decrease in impatience quantifies the weight of emotional drives in the anomalies of intertemporal choices. an experimental approach based on constructing the hyperbolic factor for each individual in different contexts is presented to test our results. the variability in the collected data highlights that individuals’ behavior is very different, suggesting the need to project strategies in personalized finance. © 2022, the author(s)."
"this research aims to discover the factors influencing gen z on investment decisions of cryptocurrency in indonesia. nowadays, cryptocurrency has become famous as most of indonesian citizens interested to invest in cryptocurrency. despite the fact that cryptocurrency fluctuates riskier than other instruments, many people still decide to invest in cryptocurrency, including gen z. the method used for this research is qualitative with semi-structured interviews conducted to collect data. semi-structured interview provides more exploratory and inclusive answers from the respondents to support this research. this research contributes to giving more knowledge and insight particularly about the factors influencing the gen z on investment decision in cryptocurrency. the results of this research have shown many factors can influence people to decide investing in cryptocurrency, such as investing in cryptocurrency can generate more profit, 24-hour market, and its fame causing a sense of fomo (fear of missing out) which are related to the theory of behavioral finance. there are some other factors such as community with other investors, influencers in social media, and people around. those factors are related to the herding theory where people are likely to follow other investors' analysis rather than doing their own research and analysis. these findings propose that investors, especially gen z, should improve their self-control as well as investment analysis to decide their investments in cryptocurrency. further research can explore other factors that may be influential by using quantitative method and by giving out questionnaires to reach out more respondents outside jabodetabek or even outside indonesia.  © 2023 acm."
"green finance, in particular equity finance, is a way for developed economies to address climate change and foster environmental innovation. in this paper, we study the role of environment-related emotions in investment decisionmaking in green equity funds. we find that both eco-anxiety and connectedness to nature have an impact on the decision to invest in green equity funds, but, interestingly, they do not have an effect on the amount invested. individual investors are influenced by their emotions and seem to benefit from the ‘warm glow’ effect regardless of the amount invested. our results are consistent with a behavioral explanation of green investing. © (2023), (economics bulletin). all rights reserved."
"objective: childhood cancer treatment completion is associated with mental health difficulties and negative socioeconomic consequences for parents. however, psychological support needs are often unmet. we developed an internet-administered, guided, low-intensity cognitive behavioral therapy-based self-help intervention (ejder) and examined feasibility and acceptability with a single-arm feasibility trial (engage). results suggest ejder is acceptable, however, adherence, especially for fathers, could be improved. following the medical research council complex interventions framework, this study explores concerns experienced by parents actively seeking support related to their child's cancer who were recruited into engage to inform further adaptation of ejder. method: seventy-three semi-structured interviews (26 fathers, 47 mothers) were conducted, with data analyzed using manifest content analysis. results: analysis resulted in seven categories: (1) feeling lost and lonely in life; (2) low mood; (3) parenting difficulties; (4) productivity difficulties; (5) relationship challenges; (6) stress reactions; and (7) worry. with the exception of subcategories afraid of not being a good parent, cancer recurrence, and child's development and future a somewhat higher percentage of mothers than fathers mentioned all identified concerns. conclusion: parents described experiencing a range of concerns after their child had completed cancer treatment. ejder will be adapted to address these concerns and include indirect intervention modules targeting concerns such as stress. information to support parenting, relationships, finance, and employment difficulties, alongside signposting to inform help-seeking, will be included. findings also suggest a need to improve the gender-sensitivity of ejder. © 2022 the authors. psycho-oncology published by john wiley & sons ltd."

"these days, it's crucial in financial services to analyze investor actions to ascertain consumers' choices, projections, studies, and revisions. the study of the investing process known as 'behavioral finance' has shown that investors do not always act logically, as they frequently become excessively driven by their desires and can't regulate their emotions, leading to poor decisions regarding investments under pressure. this research offers bayesian learning-based investor behavior analysis (bliba) to increase profits in a new market and maintain consistency in equity outcomes. income shocks from changes in the stock price are the driving force behind the suggested bliba weights caused by conservative and reflective investors in this minimalist model of investing emotions. using these weightings, one can establish a mathematical relationship between market anomalies and the investing preferences of individuals. the result demonstrates the importance of an investment decision on investor behaviour, psychology behaviour, underreaction, assurance, and the ultimate choice of the investment itself  © 2023 ieee."
"modern finance theory assumes that the stock market is efficient, and stock prices reflect all available information. however, behavioral finance theory argues that stock prices can be influenced by psychological and emotional factors. this study aims to examine the impact of behavioral finance factors on investment decisions in the saudi equity markets through the mediating variable of risk perception. an online questionnaire was distributed to 150 individual investors, out of which 134 were returned and ready for analysis. the data is analyzed using structural equation modeling (sem). the results show that herding, disposition effect, and blue chip bias have a significant positive impact on risk perception. overconfidence has a significant positive effect only on investment decision making, but not on risk perception. risk perception is found to be significantly positively related to investment decision making. all four behavioral finance factors have a significant positive indirect effect on investment decision making through risk perception. this study is conducted in a particular cultural context, namely saudi arabia, and may not be generalizable to other cultural contexts. moreover, this study focused only on four behavioral finance factors, and there may be other factors that could impact risk perception and investment decision making. the results highlight the importance of considering an individual’s perception of risk when making investment decisions, as it can significantly impact their willingness to take risks and ultimately affect the performance of their investment portfolio. the results suggest the need for investors to consider their behavioral biases and for advisors and policymakers to develop strategies to mitigate their impact. © 2023 the author(s). published by informa uk limited, trading as taylor & francis group."
"this paper focuses on the relationship between financial analysts’ recommendations and press sentiment from the perspective of the attention-grabbing theory. specifically, attention-grabbing should not be enough to explain the effect that media coverage has on investment decisions, since investors are wary of making a mistake and anticipate the regret of a future loss. our case study pertains to a column reporting on secondhand information and analysts’ recommendations. once the column did not report the analysts’ advice anymore, we hypothesized investors also assess the sentiment of the column to make sure they are not making a costly mistake. event studies on abnormal returns and multivariate analyses show that for columns with explicit analysts’ recommendations the attention-grabbing mechanism directs buying decisions while has no influences on selling decision. in the absence of explicit recommendations, investors transform the columns’ content into implicit recommendations leading their buying decisions when the sentiment is highly positive. © 2023 the institute of behavioral finance."
"gambling disorders are a serious public health problem. this manuscript will provide a comprehensive overview on this topic. gambling disorder involves repeated patterns of gambling behaviors, that result in significant distress or impairment in a person’s interpersonal relationships, employment, educational/career opportunities, and finances over a period of 12 months. gambling is defined as an activity that involves risking something of value with the hopes of acquiring something of greater value. comparable to substance use disorders, individuals with a gambling disorder may be unsuccessful in exercising control over their problematic behavior, engage in the behavior despite negative consequences, and have preoccupations/cravings to gamble. gambling disorder has higher comorbidity rates of mental disorders including depression, anxiety, substance use, and personality disorders. gamblers rarely seek treatment. treatments must be tailored to the individual which may include psychological interventions, cognitive behavioral therapy, gamblers anonymous, and psychopharmacological agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, mood stabilizers, and opioid antagonists to treat clinical symptoms. © 2023 taylor & francis group, llc."

"the rapid nature of the modernization of monetary turnover, accompanied by geopolitical risks against the background of post-pandemic economic recovery and the regionalization process, no longer just arouses the discursive interest of society, but becomes an indispensable condition of the new reality. the process of money turnover transformation by introducing digital currencies into circulation in the wave of digitalization among world powers lagging behind the evolving environment of the cryptocurrency industry is developing into a process of formalization of metaverses and penetrates deeper into the socio-economic reality. the problem of the russian practice of developing the payment environment consists in its catching-up character, caused by the spontaneous formation of the digital society, resulting in the expansion of the scope of alternative finance outside the legal field. the purpose of the paper is to determine the inherent attributes of the digital trusted environment necessary to ensure digital ruble turnover, based on an empirical study of society's perceptions about the prospects for using the digital form of the national monetary unit by representatives of various generations. we used systematization, grouping, comparative and content analysis, surveys, and the quota method to achieve the paper's purpose. the survey involved 35, 327 residents from different regions. as a result, the authors revealed the low level of readiness of society for the introduction of the digital ruble as a substitute for cash and cryptocurrency. the paper focuses on the need for an integrated approach to the disclosure of the digital ruble's value and benefits, which contributes to its successful launch and promotion in the market. the results of the research highlight the importance of correspondence in the digital ruble category “digital currencies”, and also the impossibility of making incorrect decisions in the transformation of money turnover, which leads to the growth of risks of digital inequality, the clash of interests of certain groups of the population in the prevailing behavioral patterns in the form of a cautious attitude to digital finance with insufficient financial literacy. © 2023 authors. all rights reserved."
"this study attempts to jointly identify the effects of anchoring and mean reversion on asset prices. in particular, we define “anchor reversion” as the tendency for stock prices to revert back toward an anchor, for example, the 52-week high. our results show that the further a stock moves away from its 52-week high, the more likely it is to revert back toward that 52-week high in the following month. conversely, if a stock moves toward its 52-week high in a given month, it is less likely to experience a large movement toward that 52-week high in the following month. portfolios constructed according to a long-short anchor reversion strategy result in future returns that range from 1.40% to 1.62% per month. these results are robust to controls for various risk factors as well as several cross-sectional stock characteristics, such as the monthly reversal phenomena. © 2023 the institute of behavioral finance."

"this book deals with behavioral responses of management of firms that make several decisions with respect to production, marketing, finance, organization of activities within divisions, and interrelations between divisions (including synergies between them and constraints placed on each other in the attainment of overall goals of the firm). the market conditions, that constitute the basis of such decisions, may be stable, random but predictable, or uncertain. it can be expected that objectives attained by the firm, as a result of decisions of management, may be different from the maximum which can be achieved. a generic conceptualization of such managerial discretion and operationally useful methods of measurement have been presented. it is possible to develop machine learning algorithms on this basis to minimize managerial discretion and assist managers in arriving at strategic decisions thereby leaving more resources to deal with uncertain events as they arise. the volume is a great resource not only for researchers, but also decision makers in corporates. © the editor(s) (if applicable) and the author(s), under exclusive license to springer nature singapore pte ltd. 2023."

"purpose: during recent years, there has been a growing interest in csr across disciplines. various scholars document that chief executive officer (ceo) narcissism is an important factor that should not be overlooked when analyzing csr. research on the relationship between ceo narcissism and csr has treated csr as a whole construct. however, little attention has been paid to its effect on different dimensions of csr, especially the same psychological trait may have effects on charitable donations and employee welfare. the purpose of the study is to explore the relationship between ceo narcissism and charitable donations and employee welfare, while taking into account the moderating role of the legal environment. methods: this study used the video survey method to measure ceo narcissism, the video information was obtained from baidu.com and hao.360.com search engines. other data were collected from chinese stock market research (csmar) database. we used ols regression for data analysis and also used tobit regression model to check the robustness of the estimation results. meanwhile, all analyses will be performed with stata 16.0 software. results: empirical analysis reveals that ceo narcissism has a positive and significant impact on charitable donations and has a negative and significant impact on employee welfare. moreover, the legal environment will reduce the effect of ceo narcissism on charitable donations and employee welfare, indicating that a stronger legal environment could attenuate the effect of ceo personality traits, especially narcissism on charity donations and employee welfare. conclusion: this study contributes to the behavioral finance theory and stakeholder theory to better understand the relationship between ceo narcissism and charitable donations and employee welfare. meanwhile, this study is one of the few studies to investigate the patterns of csr activities in china, an important emerging economy. © 2023 gao et al."
"we develop a multi-period information-theoretic model of initial public offering (ipo) in the presence of an adverse selection problem that addresses both underpricing in an ipo and subsequent underperformance in the long run. in this model, information asymmetry exists among the owner of a firm going ipo, underwriter(s), informed analysts and uninformed investors. information asymmetry between the owner and the investors is reduced through both the initial information production by some investors and the evaluations by informed analysts in the subsequent periods as new information arrives on the market. by incorporating future uncertainty, subsequent information revelation, certain firm-specific constraints and the actions of the agents, the optimal or sub-optimal actions of the agents are identified. the model explains why firms going public are underpriced at the ipo and, on average, underperform in the long run. the results are also compatible with social comparison explanations from a behavioral finance perspective. © 2023 informa uk limited, trading as taylor & francis group."
"purpose: the purpose of this study is to explore the intricate relationship between oil prices, house prices in the uk and norway, and the mediating role of gold and stock prices in both the short- and long-term, unraveling these complex linkages by employing an empirical approach. design/methodology/approach: this study benefits from a comprehensive set of econometric tools, including a multiequation vector autoregressive (var) system, granger causality test, impulse response function, variance decomposition and a single-equation autoregressive distributed lag (ardl) system. this rigorous approach enables to identify both short- and long-run dynamics to unravel the intricate linkages between brent oil prices, housing prices, gold prices and stock prices in the uk and norway over the period from 2005:q1 to 2022:q2. findings: the findings indicate that rising oil prices negatively impact house prices, whereas the positive influence of stock market performance on housing is more pronounced. a two-way causal relationship exists between stock market indices and house prices, whereas a one-way causal relationship exists from crude oil prices to house prices in both countries. the var model reveals that past housing prices, stock market indices in each country and brent oil prices are the primary determinants of current housing prices. the single-equation ardl results for housing prices demonstrate the existence of a long-run cointegrating relationship between real estate and stock prices. the variance decomposition analysis indicates that oil prices have a more pronounced impact on housing prices compared with stock prices. the findings reveal that shocks in stock markets have a greater influence on housing market prices than those in oil or gold prices. consequently, house prices exhibit a stronger reaction to general financial market indicators than to commodity prices. research limitations/implications: this study may have several limitations. first, the model does not include all relevant macroeconomic variables, such as interest rates, unemployment rates and gross domestic product growth. this omission may affect the accuracy of the model’s predictions and lead to inefficiencies in the real estate market. second, this study does not consider alternative explanations for market inefficiencies, such as behavioral finance factors, information asymmetry or market microstructure effects. third, the models have limitations in revealing how predictors react to positive and negative shocks. therefore, the results of this study should be interpreted with caution. practical implications: these findings hold significant implications for formulating dynamic policies aimed at stabilizing the housing markets of these two oil-producing nations. the practical implications of this study extend to academics, investors and policymakers, particularly in light of the volatility characterizing both housing and commodity markets. the findings reveal that shocks in stock markets have a more profound impact on housing market prices compared with those in oil or gold prices. consequently, house prices exhibit a stronger reaction to general financial market indicators than to commodity prices. social implications: these findings could also serve as valuable insights for future research endeavors aimed at constructing models that link real estate market dynamics to macroeconomic indicators. originality/value: using a variety of econometric approaches, this paper presents an innovative empirical analysis of the intricate relationship between euro property prices, stock prices, gold prices and oil prices in the uk and norway from 2005:q1 to 2022:q2. expanding upon the existing literature on housing market price determinants, this study delves into the role of gold and oil prices, considering their impact on industrial production and overall economic growth. this paper provides valuable policy insights for effectively managing the impact of oil price shocks on the housing market. © 2023, emerald publishing limited."

"in his book commerce des promesses, giraud (2014) reminds us that a claim is never just a promise of future payment. even if we take all possible precautions and guarantees to ensure the solvency of the debtor, we cannot absolutely guarantee the occurrence of a future due date, which is by nature uncertain. in the face of this evidence, the concept of a “risk-free assets,” which constitutes one of the cornerstones of modern financial theory, raises epistemological and ethical questions. assuming the existence of risk-free assets amounts to positing that the future is predictable and that creditor default scenarios are simply eliminated from the realm of possibility. however, uncertainty about the future results of an action often implies acting on the basis of the value of the action itself, rather than on its expected results. in a perfectly transparent deterministic world where the future would be known with certainty, ethics would be of little importance. but the uncertain nature of economic activity implies an ethical consideration of economic risk. islamic finance is an example of a philosophy of economic risk that shapes behavioral archetypes in market relations. in islamic economic morality, risk is seen as an unavoidable social cost, a kind of “common evil,” comparable to ostrom’s notion of “common good.” this common evil should be assumed collectively and shared fairly rather than be simply denied. from this perspective, the existence of risk-free assets thus creates an illusion of secure income for financiers, which would be independent of the future state of the world. this illusion can bias long-term investment decisions against the sdgs. © the author(s), under exclusive license to springer nature switzerland ag 2023."
"the pandemic and subsequent changes in various spheres of human activity have also transformed consumer behavior, particularly in the cryptocurrency market. the article is aimed at identifying the priority directions of transformations taking place in the cryp-tocurrency market in the conditions of the covid-19 pandemic under the influence of certain groups of factors. system and network approaches to understanding the cryp-tocurrency market have been identified. the cryptocurrency market is considered from a functional and institutional point of view. from a functional point of view, the crypto-currency market is a set of economic relations in cyberspace regarding cryptocurrency mining, initial coin offering (ico) and circulation of cryptocurrencies based on the laws of supply and demand. from an institutional point of view, the cryptocurrency market is a set of participants in virtual currency schemes who carry out cryptocurrency trans-actions. the following signs of cryptocurrency market segmentation are justified such as those depending on the market capitalization of the cryptocurrency; on the nature of the crypto asset's movement; on operations carried out on the market; on the region; on consumers of services. factors that influence the functioning of the cryptocurrency market are systematized according to the following groups: macroeconomic, price, en-vironmental, geographic, market, behavioral and technological. the influence of gold, oil prices, the daily number of covid-19 cases and deaths from covid-19, the msci acwi global stock index, the ishares msci all country asia ex japan etf, the wilshire 5000 total market index on the bitcoin exchange rate is revealed. the trends in the crypto-currency market development in the post-war period are justified, namely the growth of investors' interest in cryptocurrencies against the background of the initial coin offering collapse; growth of payments in cryptocurrencies; strengthening the regulatory landscape on a global and national scale; integration of the cryptocurrency market with traditional finance; attracting non-typical participants to the cryptocurrency business; expansion of participants in the infrastructure of the cryptocurrency market due to the rapid cryptocurrency market development, in particular, due to the production of equip-ment for its operation. © 2022 by the author(s)."
"introduction/main objectives: this study examines the effect of heuristic behavior on investment decision-making in the long- and short-term during the covid-19 pandemic in the indonesian capital market. background problems: traditional finance cannot fully explain how investors behave in the capital market. investors will tend to use heuristics when making investment decisions because humans have cognitive limitations, as explained in the bounded rationality theory. especially during the covid-19 pandemic, investors have shown their irrationality due to the high uncertainty and panic caused by the covid-19 pandemic. this phenomenon can only be explained by behavioral finance. novelty: this study examines the effect of bias on the investment decision-making of investors who make long-term and short-term investments. previous studies only tested the impact of bias directly, without differentiating the length of time of the investment. research methods: this study used partial least squares structural equation modelling (pls-sem) with warppls tool. testing the moderating effect was undertaken using multi-group analysis (mga). finding/ results: the results of this study indicate that anchoring and availability bias have a positive effect on investment decision-making, while representativeness bias has no significant impact. investment time moderates the effect of representativeness bias on irrational investment decision-making, while anchoring and availability bias are not supported. conclusion: anchoring and availability heuristics will increase irrational investment decisions, while the effect of representativeness heuristics on irrational investment decisions will decrease when investors make long-term investments. © 2023 gadjah mada university. all rights reserved."
"purpose: this study aims to explore the risk spillover effects among different sectors of the chinese stock market after the outbreak of covid-19 from both internet sentiment and price fluctuations. design/methodology/approach: the authors develop four indicators used for risk contagion analysis, including internet investors and news sentiments constructed by the finbert model, together with realized and jump volatilities yielded by high-frequency data. the authors also apply the time-varying parameter vector autoregressive (tvp-var) model-based and the tail-based connectedness framework to investigate the interdependence of tail risk during catastrophic events. findings: the empirical analysis provides meaningful results related to the covid-19 pandemic, stock market conditions and tail behavior. the results show that after the outbreak of covid-19, the connectivity between risk spillovers in china's stock market has grown, indicating the increased instability of the connected system and enhanced connectivity in the tail. the changes in network structure during covid-19 pandemic are not only reflected by the increased spillover connectivity but also by the closer relationships between some industries. the authors also found that major public events could significantly impact total connectedness. in addition, spillovers and network structures vary with market conditions and tend to exhibit a highly connected network structure during extreme market status. originality/value: the results confirm the connectivity between sentiments and volatilities spillovers in china's stock market, especially in the tails. the conclusion further expands the practical application and theoretical framework of behavioral finance and also lays a theoretical basis for investors to focus on the practical application of volatility prediction and risk management across stock sectors. © 2023, emerald publishing limited."
"as housing demand rose post-covid-19, new mortgage buyers with distinct preferences are entering the market. nevertheless, the mortgage purchasing process can prove intricate and precarious for individuals lacking familiarity. customers leverage various online platforms and supplementary sources to augment their knowledge and mitigate perceived risks, enabling them to make well-informed decisions during the mortgage buying process. despite exerting these efforts, customers continue to harbor unfavorable purchase intentions due to their subpar purchasing experience, leaving mortgage lenders grappling with retention issues. research has highlighted that only 15% of mortgage transfer customers would buy a mortgage from the original provider. the present study examines mortgage purchase intention and risk reduction by integrating customer empowerment and uncertainty reduction theories to contribute to the existing literature on mortgage decision-making. a survey was conducted among 554 mortgage buyers, and pls-sem was used to test the hypotheses. knowledge positively influenced satisfaction (β = 0.15, p= = 0.01), and satisfaction positively affected purchase intention (β = 0.75, p = 0.01). the mediating mechanism of risk reduction through involvement and information search is also established. the findings suggest that customers involved in decision-making and information search are more likely to be satisfied with their purchase and experience less risk. mortgage companies should encourage customers to be more involved and provide complete information during buying. as involved customers experience less confusion; they will make sound financial decisions and remain satisfied and loyal to the mortgage company. using behavioral finance, policymakers could provide customers necessary nudges to improve decision-making. © 2023 the author(s). published by informa uk limited, trading as taylor & francis group."
"the behavior of investors and their investment decision-making process in the financial markets are guided by psychological (sentiments) and personal characteristics (personality traits). research in recent years has shown the connection between investor sentiment and personality traits and investment decisions. though academic works in the field of behavioral finance are growing, studies on personality traits and investment decision-making with investor sentiment as a mediator are sparse. to this end, the paper aims to analyze the effects of indian retail investors’ big-five personality traits (neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness) on their short-term and long-term investment decision-making with the mediating effect of investor sentiment. the study employs the partial least square-structural equation model to test the framed hypotheses. the findings of the study reveal that neuroticism has a significant positive effect (β=0.352, p<0.05) on investor sentiment. it further shows that extraversion has a significant positive effect (β=0.186, p<0.05) on long-term decision-making. on the contrary, the consciousness trait has a significant negative effect (β=-0.335, p<0.05) on short-term investment decision-making. furthermore, the openness trait demonstrates a significant effect on both short-term and long-term investment decision-making (β=0.357, p<0.05; β=0.007, p<0.05). however, the findings reveal no significant intervening effect of investor sentiment between personality traits and investment decision-making. thus, the study strongly exerted the impact of investors’ personality traits on their investment decision-making due to the high influence of personal characteristics over sentiment effects. © aditi n. kamath, sandeep s. shenoy, abhilash, subrahmanya kumar n., 2023."
"how do investors’ risk preferences influence the relationships between investors’ online channel use intensity and both their trading behaviors and performance? this study answers this important question even as investors are increasingly rely on the internet for their trading activities. we leverage rare and unique micro-level historical dataset from more than 7,000 investor accounts over a 44-month period between 2010 and 2013 at a large brokerage firm in china. the dataset and analyses enable us to provide new insights into how investors’ online channel use intensity and risk preferences jointly influence their trading behaviors and performance, even though some other aspects of financial markets have changed considerably over the years. the findings reveal that although online channel use intensity is associated with increased trading volume, trading frequency, and investment returns, these effects differ across investors with different risk preferences. we find that while online channel use intensity has strong positive effects on transaction frequency for both risk-seeking and risk-averse investors, it has a much lower effect on trading volume for risk-averse investors than for risk-seeking investors. we further find that risk-averse investors with higher online channel use intensity outperform investors with other risk preferences in terms of investment performance. this paper contributes to the emerging literature at the intersection of information systems and behavioral finance by revealing the moderating role of risk preferences in the relationships between investors’ online trading channel use intensity and both their trading behaviors and outcomes. we discuss the implications for research and practice. © 2023 taylor & francis group, llc."
"in this article, the authors explain how rational consumers of financial products become irrational, that is, adopt behaviors that impede on their consumer experience, and how deception is at the heart of this phenomenon. we draw a perceptual map to show the continuum between rational-based and irrational-based economic models and deploy the key psychological constructs that cause the transfer from one state to the next, a phenomenon we label consumer financial spinning. four constructs are used to describe a dysfunctional, volatile market where policy- and agent-driven variables approach equilibrium and then soon depart from it: unmonitored predatory utility maximization, deception, risky behavior, and debt. we retrieve data from the global financial crisis to detect deceitful behaviors from macro-economic data. we provide the results of a field study using the same parameters. we show that deception is likely to increase in a predatory context, which may harm consumers, thus producing counterproductive effects, such as foreclosures or bankruptcies. lenders are provided cues and a practical assessment grid to assess the probability that their clients will resort to deception as they become increasingly desperate. this is something neither traditional nor behavioral finance and economics have offered before. © 2023, journal of economic issues/association for evolutionary economics."
"aim/purpose the aim of this research paper is to suggest a comprehensive model that incor-porates the technology acceptance model with the task-technology fit model, information quality, security, trust, and managerial support to investigate the in-tended usage of big data analytics (bda) in banks and insurance companies. background the emergence of the concept of ""big data,"" prompted by the widespread use of connected devices and social media, has been pointed out by many profes-sionals and financial institutions in particular, which makes it necessary to assess the determinants that have an impact on behavioral intention to use big data an-alytics in banks and insurance companies. methodology the integrated model was empirically assessed using self-administered question-naires from 181 prospective big data analytics users in moroccan banks and in-surance firms and examined using partial least square (pls) structural equation modeling. the results cover sample characteristics, an analysis of the validity and reliability of measurement models' variables, an evaluation of the proposed hypotheses, and a discussion of the findings. contribution the paper makes a noteworthy contribution to the bda adoption literature within the finance sector. it stands out by ingeniously amalgamating the tech-nology acceptance model (tam) with task-technology fit (ttf) while under-scoring the critical significance of information quality, trust, and managerial support, due to their profound relevance and importance in the finance domain. thus showing bda has potential applications beyond the finance sector. findings the findings showed that ttf and trust's impact on the intention to use is con-siderable. information quality positively impacted perceived usefulness and ease of use, which in turn affected the intention to use. moreover, managerial sup-port moderates the correlation between perceived usefulness and the intention to use, whereas security did not affect the intention to use and managerial sup-port did not moderate the influence of perceived ease of use. recommendations for practitioners the results suggest that financial institutions can improve their adoption deci-sions for big data analytics (bda) by understanding how users perceive it. users are predisposed to use bda if they presume it fits well with their tasks and is easy to use. the research also emphasizes the importance of relevant infor-mation quality, managerial support, and collaboration across departments to fully leverage the potential of bda. recommendations for researchers further study may be done on other business sectors to confirm its generaliza-bility and the same research design can be employed to assess bda adoption in organizations that are in the advanced stage of big data utilization. impact on society the study's findings can enable stakeholders of financial institutions that are at the primary stage of big data exploitation to understand how users perceive bda technologies and the way their perception can influence their intention to-ward their use. future research future research is expected to conduct a comparison of the moderating effect of managerial support on users with technical expertise versus those without; in addition, international studies across developed countries are required to build a solid understanding of users' perceptions towards bda. © 2023 informing science institute. all rights reserved."

"background: as an application of inclusive finance in health insurance, inclusive commercial health insurance (ichi) is a new public-private partnership-based health insurance scheme and has been vigorously promoted by the chinese government in recent years to develop china multi-level health insurance system, a system that aims to seek a mix of public and private sources to provide more affordable financial protection to all levels of society in line with their needs. however, the overall enrolment of ichi scheme is still at a low level, and little is known about what influences residents' enrolment intentions. the aim of this study was to examine the multidimensional factors influencing residents' behavioral intentions and to develop a multivariate conceptual model to explore the psychographic process in the formation of enrolment intention. methods: the empirical data used for model validation were obtained from a cross-sectional study conducted in nanjing, china, a representative pilot city of ichi scheme in 2022. exploratory factor analysis, anova, standard multiple regression, and hierarchical multiple regression were mainly employed for hypothesis testing. results: the findings revealed that involvement, perceived benefit, and perceived sacrifice are all crucial psychographic process factors in the formation of residents' enrolment intentions. government participation positively moderates the influence path of “perceived benefit—enrolment intention” but negatively moderates the path of “perceived sacrifice—enrolment intention”. moreover, it was discovered that perceived benefit mediates the effect of involvement on enrolment intention, while perceived sacrifice does not. conclusions: improving residents' perceived benefit and involvement degree of the product, as well as reducing their perceived sacrifice, are both key to increasing their enrolment intentions. this study also points out that one of the main dilemmas in the current development of ichi scheme is the low level of involvement among residents, and that optimizing the product design to make it more relevant to residents' lives is a more beneficial strategy to increase overall involvement. copyright © 2023 shen, wang, xie, han, shao and jiang."
"the biometric characteristics are explored in the context of a case study on iot-based biometric cyber security systems focused on the banking sector for the verification and safety issues and accomplishments. mostly with the daily increase in security violations and fraudulent transaction, the necessity for highly secure identifying systems and person verifies identity systems, particularly for the banking and finance sectors, becomes vitally vital. many banking institutions see biometric technology as a very close answer to such security issues. though iot-based biometric technology has obtained acceptance in fields such as healthcare and various security activity, its use in banking security is still in its early stages. there is the tight relationship between biometric and human, physical, and behavioral factors, such modern technologies present a plethora of social, ethical, and systems difficulties. the main, success elements given by the case study served as a guideline for iot-based biometrically enabled banking safety system planned by a significant banking company. this prototype study reveals that it is of primary importance to draw on a viable security plan that addresses user privacy concerns using smart sensor, the level of human endurance, institutional changes, and valid issues rather than dealing with technological issues related to gelling biometrics into existing information systems. however, if smart sensor-based biometric technology in banking is successfully used, privacy issues don’t persist. in numerous areas connected to immigration control and crime, they do not do and study the financial environment. all banks do not strengthen their safety measures due to socio-technical challenges with their iot-based biometric solutions. this article fulfills the demand for a standard to recognize possible difficulties and success explanations for the application of sustainable iot-based biometrics in the system for access control. our research work is only the point of departure for researchers to further research iot smart sensor-based biometric applications in multiple banking components. © 2023, the author(s), under exclusive license to springer nature singapore pte ltd."

"purpose: research in the domain of behavioral finance has proven that investors demonstrate irrational behavior while making investment decisions. in a similar domain, the primary objective of this research is to prioritize the behavioral biases that influence cryptocurrency investors' investment decisions in the indian context. design/methodology/approach: a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (f-ahp) was used to prioritize the behavioral factors impacting cryptocurrency investors' investment decisions. overconfidence and optimism, anchoring, representativeness, information availability, herding, regret aversion, and loss aversion are among the primary biases evaluated in the present study. findings: the findings suggested that the two most important influential criteria were herding and regret aversion, with loss aversion and information availability being the least influential criteria. opinions of family, friends, and colleagues about investment in cryptocurrency, the sale of cryptocurrencies that have increased in value, the avoidance of selling currencies that have decreased in value, the agony of holding losing cryptocurrencies for too long rather than selling winning cryptocurrencies too soon, and the purchase of cryptocurrencies that have fallen significantly from their all-time high are the most important sub-criteria. research limitations/implications: this survey only covered active cryptocurrency participants. additionally, the study was limited to individual crypto investors in one country, india, with a sample size of 467 participants. although the sample size is appropriate, a larger sample size might reflect the more realistic scenario of the indian crypto market. practical implications: the study is relevant to individual and institutional cryptocurrency investors, crypto portfolio managers, policymakers, researchers, market regulators, and society at large. originality/value: to the best of the authors' knowledge, no prior research has attempted to explain how the overall importance of various criteria and sub-criteria related to behavioral factors that influence the decision-making process of crypto retail investors can be assessed and how the priority of focus can be established, particularly in the indian context. © 2023, emerald publishing limited."
"this study explores the influence of chinese news sentiment on us stocks, focusing on the potential policy shift granting chinese retail traders direct access to us markets. analyzing the flow of information between chinese news sentiment and global news sentiment using transfer entropy, the findings reveal a significant influence of chinese news sentiment on global news sentiment. moreover, the study identifies a predominant unidirectional flow of information from news sentiment to stock returns, with chinese news sentiment having a more substantial impact on future returns of us stocks compared to global news sentiment. this suggests that if the proposed policy changes succeed, chinese retail traders may rely on chinese news sentiment, potentially leading to increased volatility in the us market. policymakers and market participants should be aware of these implications to prepare for changes in the us stock market dynamics. further research can provide deeper insights into the interplay between news sentiment, investor behavior, and market volatility. © 2023 the institute of behavioral finance."
"to achieve success in financial markets, no matter how much data is obtained and trading markets develop, it will continue to be a fundamental problem for professional portfolio managers, academics, and society. the modern portfolio theory proposed by the american economist harry markowitz to find solutions to the problems in portfolio allocation (1952) made its mark in history as the pioneering work of the period. afterward, many studies have been carried out to design the best portfolio distribution method based on this study. the resulting studies provided solutions to the missing points in previous studies in parallel with the development and maturation of the stock market. advances in different academic fields (e.g., behavioral finance, operations research) and technological advances (e.g. big data, fast computers) have influenced these studies. there are several approaches to improving the portfolio allocation process. the primary purpose of this study is to examine the effects of different portfolio allocation techniques, whose first emergence dates back to the middle of the 20th century, on new-generation risky assets by using linguistic labels (fuzzy terms) to express the preferences of decision-makers due to the uncertainty of information in the financial markets and the complexity of the decision-making problem. it is expected that serious differences will be observed in performance measurements due to the structure of the stocks they are working on and the price structure of the crypto assets used in this study. the success of crypto-assets is expected to fail older-generation investment instruments (stocks, commodities) visibly. © 2023, the author(s), under exclusive license to springer nature switzerland ag."

"introduction: introduction: the impact of cryptocurrency volatility on investor emotions and decision-making refers to how the erratic and swift price changes of cryptocurrencies can have an impact on investors' psychological states and ultimately influence their investing choices. since the start of 2013, the cryptocurrency market has drawn a lot of attention from the media and academia due to its significant price fluctuations. methods: by examining the impact of behavioral finance characteristics on investment choices in the cryptocurrency market, this study focuses on arab investors who invest in the market. through the use of questionnaires and a snowball sampling technique, a quantitative approach was taken. result: the findings demonstrate that prospect theory, heuristic theory, and herding theory all significantly influence investors' choice to invest in the bitcoin market. this highlights the important part played by the suggested behavioral elements in influencing investors' investing choices. by combining the findings of other studies, this work adds to the body of existing research. additionally, it boosts the ability of investors to make defensible decisions based on their grasp of the mechanics of the bitcoin market. conclusion: the implications of the findings will help errant investors become increasingly ready to stay in the bitcoin market and advance their knowledge of the most effective way to make wise investment decisions. the results of this study will also motivate financial experts to acknowledge that knowledge of conventional finance theory is insufficient for success in the bitcoin market. © 2023, journal for reattach therapy and developmental diversities. all rights reserved."
"underpinned by the accelerated progression of information technology, the role of educational big data in information gathering and analysis has been underscored, particularly so in finance, a discipline embedded in logic and analysis. patterns in student learning and behavioral data, when examined, can afford educators invaluable insights to shape efficacious teaching strategies. contemporary research probing into the dynamics of student learning preference evolution and cognitive advancement appears to over-depend on static data, often falling short of effectively addressing the intricate data structures in educational big data. in this light, it becomes imperative to delve into the temporal shifts in student learning preferences and their link to cognitive advancement. in this context, a novel dynamic trustaware preference evolution model is brought to the fore, with the potential to precisely track variations in learning preferences of finance students and elucidate their correlation with cognitive advancement. a correlation model is erected, laying bare the reciprocal interaction between the metamorphosis of student learning preferences and cognitive progression. this pioneering approach eclipses the constraints inherent in extant research methodologies, rendering deeper comprehension to educators. findings from regression analysis divulge the association between the transformative journey of learning preferences and cognitive advancement, holding far-reaching implications for educational practices. these revelations can capacitate educators to fine-tune their teaching approaches in line with student development, fostering personalized learning ecosystems. this research further holds significant merits for addressing complexities within finance education, aiding in the cultivation of adept professionals capable of navigating the fluid landscape of modern finance. © 2023 by the authors of this article. published under cc-by."
"this research examined the association between technology readiness of farmers and their behavioral intention to adopt a mobile agricultural finance app called the e-agrifinance app, as well as if gender, age, and educational level affect their technology readiness and behavioral intention. a questionnaire survey was conducted to collect primary data from 334 farmers cultivating oil palm, rubber, cocoa, and pepper in sarawak. data were analyzed using correlation analysis and independent t-tests. the study revealed that the motivator dimension of technology readiness relates positively with behavioral intention while the inhibitor dimension relates negatively with behavioral intention. female farmers were found to have higher mean scores in the motivator dimension and behavioral intention than male farmers. farmers who are older and received lower education were found to have lower mean scores in the motivator dimension than those younger and have higher education. the findings provided alternative explanation of the role of demographic variables – gender, age, and educational level in the technology adoption literature in the context of farmers. for practice, the findings provided the sarawak government and other stakeholders with insights about promoting digital inclusion among farmers. © the author(s) 2023."

"the framework of this paper is behavioral finance and, more specifically, intertemporal choice when individuals exhibit decreasing impatience in their decision-making processes. after characterizing the two main types of decreasing impatience (moderately and strongly decreasing impatience), the main objective of this paper is to generalize these concepts when the criterion of time increase is given by an arbitrary function which describes such increments. in general, the methodology is mathematical calculus but particularly the concept of derivative according to the function which rules the increase of time. the main contribution of this paper is the characterization of this extension of the concept of decreasing impatience by using the aforementioned novel derivative and the well-known prelec’s index. © 2023 the author(s), licensee aims press."
"this paper examines the relationship between investors' demographic variables and behavioral biases. this study includes demographic factors like age, gender, marital status, income level, level of education, occupation, and investment experience of individual investors. the study uses t-test and anova to examine the survey data of 184 retail investors in delhi-ncr. the research findings show the existence of behavioral biases like anchoring, mental accounting, overconfidence, herding, and loss aversion. the findings support the existence of biases among individuals and show that their behavior is not always rational. this study is to find an association of variables, not to find out the causality. the results of this research should not be taken as implying causation. the findings could have consequences for financial educators who want to promote personal financial awareness. understanding the decision-making processes of their clients can help financial advisors become more effective. despite detailed literature on behavioral finance, only a small amount of academic research has been done to analyze the relationship between biases and demographic factors in the context of retail investors in delhi-ncr. by attempting to fill this gap in the literature, this study contributes to it. © 2023 scms group of educational institutions. all rights reserved."
"public comments criticizing the honesty and trustworthiness of professionals in finance (pifs) are commonly seen as a way to motivate them towards engaging in more socially responsible business practices. however, the link between public views of this professional group, the self-views of individual group members, and their motivation to engage in corporate social responsibility (csr) activities has not been empirically examined. in this research, we draw on social identity theory (sit) and the behavioral regulation model for social evaluation (brm) to examine how the self-views of individual group members relate to perceived characteristics of their professional group, indicating competence and morality. in two studies (n = 123, 191) we examined whether the self-views of high-profile and general pifs are affected by other people's perceptions of the honesty and trustworthiness of this professional group. the results offer support for our reasoning derived from sit and the brm. in both studies, we first demonstrate that public concerns about the group's lack of honesty and trustworthiness impact on the moral self-views of financial professionals. subsequently, we employ an experimental design to reveal that reinforcing moral criticism leveled at the group only reduces the motivation of individual group members to engage in csr activities, while group-level moral affirmation enhances this motivation. the results of both studies converge to demonstrate how public critique on the moral behavior of their professional group relates to the self-views and behavioral motives of pifs. we consider the theoretical and practical implications of these findings. © 2022 the authors. business ethics, the environment & responsibility published by john wiley & sons ltd."
"it is difficult to see the theories or models set up after the 1980s in finance related textbooks, most or all important theories and models were established before 1980. for example, portfolio theory (1952), mm models (1958, 1963), capital asset pricing model (1964), and black–scholes model (1973). it turns out that the financial theory or models found in early years can really solve problems, while the theories created in recent decades, such as information asymmetry theory, behavioral finance theory, pecking order theory, etc., does not solve any problem. for example, “information asymmetry” is just a phenomenon or common sense; some theories set up in recent years is even at a level below common sense. common sense is not a theory, do not mention the theories below the level of common sense. theory should be higher than common sense in order to guide practice; otherwise, there is no significance for the scientific research. but why financial research in recent decades can only create theories or conclusions at or below common sense? this further discussion makes a deep discussion on it. after the world war ii, with the recovery and development of the economies of main countries, the research of financial theory had also boomed over about 30 years and obtained a lot of theoretical discoveries. these theoretical discoveries not only solve relevant financial problems and promote the understanding of relevant issues, but also promote financial research from experience-based level to the height of science and theory, becoming milestones one after another in the development of financial theory. for various reasons, in recent decades since 1980s, the financial research and findings went back to experience-based or even common sense level, such as information asymmetry theory, behavioral finance theory, pecking order theory, etc. perhaps most people have not realized that those new and popular “theories” are just well known common senses being renamed; and the new stylized financial research does not intend originally to solve decision problems in finance, but just to describe various and endless phenomena in finance and to make some explanations based on subjective guesses. related to the common sense level in research, after decades of research in full swing, the remained financial problems have basically not been further solved, and there is even no progress in the relevant understanding. however, the problem is, why is financial research has been stayed at the common sense level or even lower than common sense level? the reasons behind this phenomenon deserve our deep thinking and reflection. © 2023, the author(s), under exclusive license to springer nature singapore pte ltd."
"the topic financial risk tolerance has been extensively studied globally. risk tolerance is the risk that an investor is willing to take or the level of uncertainty that an investor may face. in recent years, factors having influence on risk tolerance of investors is an issue which many financial researchers would like to tackle. this study investigated the influence of the big five personality traits and financial literacy on risk tolerance. a sample of filipino investors, comprising of 320 students and faculty members from higher education institutions in metro manila, were surveyed via google forms employing a four-point likert scale to determine their risk tolerance, big five personality traits, and financial literacy. using multiple regression analysis, it was established that the big five personality traits (extraversion, openness to experience, and neuroticism), as well as financial literacy, influence the risk tolerance of the respondents. this study may contribute to the literature, specifically on behavioral finance. copyright © 2023 gmp press and printing."
"purpose: this paper aims at assessing the impact of a number of behavioral interventions on the willingness of informal businesses, in the egyptian informal sector, to join the formal sector. design/methodology/approach: this paper uses an experimental methodology to examine the impact of behavioral interventions on the formalization of the egyptian informal sector. specifically, it conducts a survey experiment on a total of 240 informal businesses, operating in the egyptian informal sector. the primary data collected from the survey experiment is then analyzed using a binary logistic regression to assess the impact of the behavioral primes on the probability of joining the formal market. findings: the empirical findings of the survey experiment indicate that the biggest obstacle facing informal businesses is finding a formal source of finance that could help them in penetrating the market. providing informal businesses with information on funding opportunities offered by the ministry of micro, small and medium enterprises (msme) significantly increased the probability of joining the formal sector to benefit from this opportunity. originality/value: this paper is the first to apply behavioral primes, in the form of informational cues, to the egyptian case of informal business owners. previous research on the use of behavioral nudges and primes has focused mainly on the western economies. © 2023, rania moaaz and sarah mansour."
"few studies have examined the psychological factors that shape real estate developers’ overbuilding behaviors in china. through a behavioral lens, this study explores the effect of developers’ excessive optimism on the formation of overbuilding in ordos city, china. it finds that excessive optimism, manifested by the firm yet unjustified belief in a long-lasting real estate boom, was prevalent among developers who built vacant and unfinished new residential projects in the dongsheng district, ordos. it also discovers the crucial roles of the pro-growth local governments and the booming real estate market—including the easy availability of credit, especially the pervasive informal finance—in reinforcing developers’ excessive optimism in dongsheng. this study confirms the positive effect of market booms on investors’ excessive optimism. moreover, it sheds light on the role of the state in shaping excessive optimism and reveals that the state’s proactive participation and investment in market transactions can reinforce developers’ over-optimism. this article suggests that studies on excessive optimism should adequately consider its socioeconomic and politico-institutional settings. this study verifies the validity and necessity of adopting a behavioral perspective to interpret china’s overbuilding and calls for further inquiry into the underexplored scholarship at the intersection of behavioral science and real estate development in china. © 2023 urban affairs association."
"in the age of technology, the usage of mobile payment apps is playing a significant role in financially strengthening urban areas. this research aims to identify the enablers affecting the use of mobile technology by the urban poor households in pune, maharashtra, india, and to identify the user behaviour in technology adaptation. the published literature was thoroughly reviewed with respect to mobile payment, financial technology, and financial inclusion. the data was collected through a field survey. simultaneously, a structural equation model is developed using amos software, and spss is used to perform factor analysis. the theoretical framework is based on the unified theory of acceptance and the use of technology (utaut-2) model. the enablers are performance expectancy (p.e.), economic benefit (e.b.), convenience, technical conditions (t.c.), hedonic motivation (h.m.), and behavioural intention (b.i.), social influence (s.i.) are impacting the use of mobile apps related to finance under the mediating effect of behavioral intention, thereby supporting financial inclusion. gender, education, occupation, and income are the control variables. men are more frequent users of mobile payment apps. this study is unique in the context of urban poor households regarding the use of m-payment app and to understand their behavior and actual usage pattern. the current study also has some implications for the banking and mobile technology industry. they may start new strategies for mobile industries, and certain factors such as security, convenience, and technical conditions can influence customer intention of using m-payment apps; hence, it needs proper consideration. simultaneously, banks and technology industries must verify their privacy norms and make it easy for customers to use technology. © 2023, university of wollongong. all rights reserved."
"most economic and financial theories assume that market participants act rationally and use available information in their decision-making processes to maximize their expected utility. recently, the scientific debate in behavioral economics and finance has highlighted that individuals can make choices other than those envisaged by standard economic theory. in fact, the choices can be conditioned by the way in which the alternatives are presented. in particular, the framing effect refers to the cognitive bias wherein an individual’s choice from a set of options is influenced more by how the information is worded than by the information itself. the purposes of this study are: testing if the framing effect affects investor's perception of risk and, consequently, decision making in choosing financial products; investigating if the effect is different in relation to certain social, cultural and demographic characteristics of the investor. by considering italian people aged between 20 and 64 years as target population, a questionnaire was administered to 1130 individuals to understand how two of the main common types of presentation of non-equity financial products (i.e.: “what-if” and “probabilistic scenarios”) can influence the decision-making process. the data analysis was carried out by using the analytical hierarchical process approach that is a multi-criteria support technique that allows to compare qualitative and quantitative criteria that would otherwise be difficult to compare. in the present paper, the use of analytical hierarchical process allowed the decomposition of each decision maker's decision-making process into personal characteristics. © 2022, the author(s), under exclusive licence to springer science+business media, llc, part of springer nature."
"investing in the financial market is a way to grow wealth. this investment undoubtedly generates a return accompanied by a certain level of risk. in finance, risk occupies a crucial place in the stock market. indeed, it intervenes in the process of choice and selection of the portfolio. investment decisions can be tricky from time to time and require further thought. the achievement of judicious investment is based on a knowledge of the financial market evolution, the behavior of investors as well as techniques of portfolio management. multitudes of strategies have been implemented over time to effectively manage the portfolio. within this framework, various strategies have been implemented such as modern portfolio theory (mpt) and behavioral portfolio theory (bpt). we concentrate on portfolio optimization for two alternative approaches: the mvt and the bpt. this study aims to compare portfolios generated by these two approaches during political and covid-19 crisis periods using data from the tunisian stock market exchange for the period 2009 –2022. the results show that in the case of a higher degree of risk aversion induced by investors’ bpt, all the stock is located at the top right of the mean-variance frontier. however, during the crisis, the portfolios selected by rational investors were not systematically selected by irrational investors, even if the optimal portfolio of bpt coincides with the markowitz efficiency frontier. the results indicate that the crisis induces simultaneously an increase in risk and a sharp decrease in the portfolio return of individuals who follow the mean-variance theory of markowitz. © 2023, world scientific and engineering academy and society. all rights reserved."

"the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus pandemic (covid-19) has adversely impacted global economies and stock markets. this study employs an event study methodology to assess the impact of covid-19 on stock returns in the healthcare (66 stocks) and tourism (39 stocks) sectors in indian markets surrounding two events: a) the first covid-19 case reported in india and b) the announcement of a nationwide lockdown. the findings indicate that investors' reactions to both events were distinct and asymmetric in healthcare and tourism sectors. the tourism sector stocks react more negatively to the second event than the first, with -2.46% vs. -0.59% event day abnormal returns, respectively. the corresponding figures for healthcare sector stocks are -0.68% and -0.16%, respectively. as expected, pandemic events had a minor negative impact on the healthcare sector. surprisingly, the tourism industry did not react negatively to the first event. investors in the tourism industry underreacted to the first reported case; they could not predict the potential consequences and then overreacted to the lockdown announcement. the findings support the behavioral finance theory of underreaction and overreaction, particularly in stressful situations. the study has implications for investors and money managers looking for profitable investment opportunities due to temporary dislocations in stock prices caused by investors' irrational reactions to certain black swan events.  © mayank joshipura, ashu lamba, 2022."
"an increasing amount of research aims to understand how consumers make financial decisions. however, there are important gaps in this area, especially related to the influence of behavioral biases in financial decision-making (wang et al., 2019) and their impact on investors’ performance and well-being. many individual investors lack the appropriate skills to make sound investment decisions, and yet the number of people investing in financial markets has significantly grown over the last years (barber et al., 2009). the disposition effect (i.e., the tendency to sell winning investments too early, while keeping losing investments too long; shefrin & statman, 1985) is one of the most widespread behavioral biases related to financial decision-making. it has been documented for inexperienced individual investors and highly experienced institutional agents (chen et al., 2007) when executing a variety of financial decisions (coval & shumway, 2005; genesove & mayer, 2001; heath et al., 1999; heisler, 1994; locke & mann, 2005) in real and experimental markets (grinblatt & han, 2005). while robo-advisors could be a solution to reduce investors’ disposition effect, research has shown that many investors are reluctant to accept recommendations of a robo-advisor (hildebrand & bergner, 2020; jung et al., 2018). therefore, three studies investigate under what circumstances investors would increase their use of a robo-advisor so that they can reduce their disposition effect. first, an experimental study based on an investment game examined the impact of availability of robo-advisors (i.e., available vs not available) on the disposition effect. results showed that there is no significant impact of availability of robo-advisor on the disposition effect. these results suggest that the mere availability of robo-advisors to investors is not a sufficient condition for them to use this investment aid, even if they are informed that the robo-advisor only makes rational decisions. second, an experimental study examined whether awareness of behavioral biases can moderate the relationship between availability of robo advisors and the disposition effect. the results showed that when investors are aware of their behavioral biases via a just-in-time behavioral finance training, they reduce their disposition effect. finally, a field study among users of a robo-advisor, conducted in partnership with nalo – a robo-advisor provider, showed that awareness of behavioral biases had a significant impact on actual investment behavior. the more investors are aware of their behavioral biases, the more they invest using robo-advisors. we discuss theoretical and managerial implications of these findings. © 2023, the author(s), under exclusive license to springer nature switzerland ag."
"based on recent neuroscience findings, we consider the brain to be a bayesian prediction engine operating under a resource constraint. it meets incoming information with predictions based on an internal model of the world. finite brain resources are then spent on processing the gaps between incoming information and these predictions. in addition, adverse information may trigger a stress response, exacting a cost on the brain and the body. we argue that the brain, which ultimately is the seat of all decision-making, considers these costs while choosing among alternatives. we show that incorporating such costs enriches our understanding of the financial market behavior by providing a new approach to recent financial innovations, as well as pushing up the equity premium and making it countercyclical. ignoring such costs may make certain and uncertain utility appear different from each other consistent with recent empirical findings. © 2023 the institute of behavioral finance."

"this study seeks to contribute to the body of research on economic sustainability during periods of crisis by examining investor behavior in china during the covid-19 pandemic in 2020. economic conditions in china during 2020 can be separated into the first half of the year, a period of extreme economic uncertainty, and the second half of the year when there was almost no covid and was a period of relative economic stability. unexpectedly, chinese funds showed consistent, strong growth throughout all of 2020. this study applies behavioral finance theory to interpret data gathered through an online survey to examine several factors in the psychology of investors during these two periods. factors included; risk avoidance, heuristic, prospect, and herding. the heuristic factor was further divided into: representativeness, anchoring, overconfidence, gambler fallacy, and availability bias. the prospect factor included loss aversion and regret aversion. the analysis indicates that low-risk funds' investments grew significantly during the first half of the year due to risk avoidance behavior. during the second half of 2020, as the level of uncertainty and risk in china was considerably reduced, investment in low-risk funds continued with robust activity and growth due to the investment psychology of the herding effect. the findings contribute to the body of knowledge on investor behavior and market resiliency during periods of crisis. copyright © 2023 gmp press and printing."
"stock trading apps have encouraged millions of people to begin micro-investing. while investing is beneficial in the long-run, we demonstrate a potential downside to the micro-investing trend. using a novel data set of stock trades from an app-based broker, we show that anchoring leads to lower wealth accumulation when investors start their journey with a small first purchase. a unique feature of the broker’s platform allows us to disentangle anchoring from a rational repetition strategy: stock gift cards. since the value of a stock gift card is determined exogenously, the amount of that gift card represents a true external anchor for the recipient, affecting subsequent behaviors. over one year, a $1 increase in the amount of an investor’s initial stock purchase results in a $4.63 increase in the total amount that an investor contributes to their investment account, all else equal. © 2023 the institute of behavioral finance."

"purpose: this study examines the antecedents and predictors of investment intention and the mediating role of investment self-efficacy. the study empirically investigates the complexity of the decision-making process related to financial investment in shandong, china. design/methodology/approach: the integrated behavioral model underpinned the research. the sample was selected using the judgmental-sampling method. a sample of 313 responses from young income earners aged 25 to 39 was analyzed. twelve hypotheses were tested using the smartpls statistical software. findings: the resultant outcomes contradict the normative theory of finance. the findings revealed that psychological (risk perception and subjective financial knowledge) and sociological (influences of family, friends, and internet) factors significantly influence the attitude of young income earners toward investment. investment self-efficacy dem-onstrates a significant mediating role, as the indirect effect is almost half the total effect. evidently, subjective financial knowledge positively influences investment self-efficacy, which in turn has a positive influence on investment intent. research limitations/implications: the result is concerning as young wage earners appear overconfident in their financial skills. policymakers and relevant market actors should strive to improve real financial knowledge, as real financial knowledge is known to be linked with the effectiveness of financial investments. future research in this area may adopt a mixed-method approach as it has the potential to uncover new variables and provide a broader spectrum to understand the complexity of people's investment decision-making process. originality/value: the study highlights the complexity of the decision-making process. it highlights the central role of self-efficacy in explaining investment intention. the empirical evidence from the world's most populous nation, china, expands the relevance of behavioral finance theory in mainstream finance research. © the author(s)."
"china is an important emerging economy, and its capital market has witnessed rapid development in recent years. at the same time, market pressure and exposed risks have increased significantly, which might negatively influence entrepreneurial behaviors. from the perspective of behavioral finance, this study explored the impact of managers’ overconfidence on entrepreneurship, by analyzing mergers and acquisitions (m&as) of listed firms. empirical studies were performed on listed chinese firms by constructing a comprehensive index to measure managers’ overconfidence. the results show that overconfidence, which might promote the chance to exploit the business opportunities of m&as, has a negative impact on both, innovation entrepreneurship and profitability, after the m&a. propensity score matching was also performed for possible sample selection bias, and the results support the same findings. © 2022 elsevier inc."
"this chapter describes the role of iot in digital financial inclusion. according to the world bank, approximately 19 crore individuals are without basic banking services. individuals who are unbanked or underbanked can benefit from financial inclusion by overcoming physical, technological, and behavioral barriers to finance usage accessibility. unbanked persons can gain access to financial services and break out of the poverty cycle by combining online financial tools (such as smartphone remittances via iot) with psychological tools (such as financial education). the study focuses to identify the underlying factors affecting the role of iot in digital financial inclusion. the study is based on a sample size of 120 respondents from the national capital region. the principal component analysis method is used to find the factors. total seven significant factors are identified, viz., iot awareness, financial service awareness, usability, benefits, trust, security, and privacy, as well as accessibility. © 2023, the author(s), under exclusive license to springer nature switzerland ag."
"the main aim of this paper is to investigate the impact of behavioral biases on the decisions of jordanian investors. this empirical study investigated the impact of six behavioral finance biases and their impact on jordanian investors’ financial decisions in the amman stock exchange (ase). specifically, this paper empirically examines the impact of cognitive and emotional biases such as overconfidence, representation, availability, loss aversion, anchoring and regret aversion on investors’ financial decisions. following chaffai and medhioub’s (2014) methodology, the paper applied the questionnaire-based approach and managed to collect 693 responses out of 2000 questionnaires (34.65 percent response rate) during the last five years. the main result achieved is that jordanian investors take their decisions by falling for three main biases such as overconfidence, loss aversion, and anchoring. jordanian investors believe that their decisions will lead to positive gains even if they are not based on highly developed models that can be used to direct investment strategies. © 2023 the author."

"the quality of institutions occupies a central place in the set of non-economic factors influencing macroeconomic dynamics and the development of financial markets. this quality is largely shaped by objective factors that accompany the historical process. therefore, this study focuses on the driving forces of this process and how they affect the quality of institutions. it is shown that the main such force or source of institutional change is culture, interpreted in a broad sense, which includes not only that accumulated at different stages of the historical process relevant heritage, but also behavioral attitudes and value beliefs prevailing in society that affect decision-making. the thesis about the importance of culture as a source of formation of the quality of national institutions and a factor of sustainable economic dynamics is substantiated through the example of specific historical events. underestimation of this conditionality often prioritizes economic policy goals of financial development without due consideration and assessment of institutional constraints. this factor in macroeconomic decision-making is mainly characteristic of emerging market economies. at the same time, the results of research in recent decades indicate that the impact of financial development on macroeconomic dynamics is positive and strong in conditions of high-quality institutions. this allows the article to assess the role of finance and the quality of institutions differently in the set of state economic policy priorities. as applied to individual countries with obvious deficiencies in the institutional environment, this study, referring to historical experience and modern empirical material, puts forward and substantiates the thesis that ensures a high quality of institutions is the most important priority of transforming financial development into a factor of positive and sustainable economic growth. © 2023 by the authors."

"the underlying assumption of using investor sentiment to predict stock prices, stock market returns, and liquidity is that of synergy between stock prices and investor sentiment. however, this synergistic relationship has received little attention in the literature. this paper investigates the synergistic pattern between stock prices and investor sentiment using social media messages from stock market investors and natural language processing techniques. at the macro level, we reveal extremely significant positive synergy between investor sentiment and stock prices. that is, when a stock price rises, investor sentiment rises, and when a stock price falls, investor sentiment falls. however, this synergy may be reversed or even disappear over a specific time period. through a segmented measurement of the synergy between stock prices and investor sentiment over the course of a day, we also find that investor sentiment on social media is forward looking. this provides theoretical support for using investor sentiment in stock price prediction. we also examine the effect of lockdowns, the most draconian response to covid-19, on synergy between stock prices and investor sentiment through causal inference machine learning. our analysis shows that external anxiety can significantly affect synergy between stock prices and investor sentiment, but this effect can promote either positive or negative synergy. this paper offers a new perspective on stock price forecasting, investor sentiment, behavioral finance, and the impact of covid-19 on the stock markets. © 2022 borsa ä°stanbul anonim åžirketi"
"established as a multilateral development bank (mdb) funded by african states, the african development bank (afdb) is one of many similar international organizations (ios) comprising the development finance regime complex. arguably, states and policy elites recreate similar ios that enable ""norm conformance""within the complex. this is demonstrated through the afdb's adoption of the independent recourse mechanism (irm) in 2004. despite no need or demand, the relatively insulated afdb agreed to provide recourse for people adversely affected by afdb-financed projects. this article argues that consensus among state and nonstate actors around an accountability policy norm led the afdb to conform. nonregional member states, particularly the united states, used typical norm diffusion mechanisms: financial incentives, normative suasion, and voting on the afdb's board. the concept of norm conformance highlights how behavioral expectations and organizational practices change based on what is socially appropriate. © 2023 brill academic publishers. all rights reserved."
"the creation of a new business is an act of entrepreneurship. it is also a financial undertaking. hence it is admissible to apply the apparatus of behavioral finance to study the determinants of business formation. our results show that aggregate us business formation, nationally and regionally, is jointly predicted by economic fundamentals and sentiment. there is evidence of both ‘pull’ and ‘push’ motives for entrepreneurship. yet this simple structure does not survive decomposition by payroll propensity. high-payroll-propensity entrepreneurs respond primarily to pull-motive fundamentals, with sentiment accounting for a small fraction of explained variance. low-payroll-propensity entrepreneurs, on the other hand, respond to both sentiment and fundamentals, representing both pull and push motives, with sentiment accounting for a large fraction of explained variance. low-payroll-propensity business formation is twice as volatile as high-payroll-propensity entrepreneurship, and similarly to noise-based decision making in behavioral finance, it is substantially driven by sentiment. © 2022 the author(s). published by informa uk limited, trading as taylor & francis group."
"although digitalisation brings important possibilities to banking & finance service, implementing digital technologies in practices can be challenging. indeed, the adoption of new innovative technology in the banking & finance sector lags behind other business sectors. many of the valuable banking & finance-related technologies have not been adopted in relation to the strategic implications of decisions in domains such as the development of service innovation and personalization, value co-creation, and marketing strategies. in particular, there is a paucity of research in using gamification to explore ways of customising banking & finance fintech offerings, improving customers’ experience, and developing efficient banking & finance marketing tactics. drawing on the utaut2 and otcalysis gamification framework, this study develops a research model investigating what configurations of motivations, expectations and conditions can shape consumers’ behavioral intention to adopt a gamified mobile wallet system. findings suggest that combining effort expectancy, facilitating conditions and perceived value leads to higher intention to use gamified mobile wallet. accordingly, firms need to consider the three core conditions when design relevant gamifications. © 2022 the authors"

"purpose: this study aims to analyze the effects of attitude, social influence and self-efficacy on the behavior of using islamic financial products based on the attitude–social influence–self-efficacy (ase) model. design/methodology/approach: in view of the research objective, an explanatory research design was used in this study. in the study, because a conceptual assessment was not made, or a proposal was not developed, the ase model was used. in testing the ase model, the structural equation modeling method as a multivariate and sophisticated type of analysis was used. findings: the results obtained in this study demonstrated that the ase model was a tool to be used in explaining consumers’ intentions of using islamic financial products. in this study, “attitude,” “social influence” and “self-efficacy” were explored as the variables affecting the use of islamic financial products on the basis of the ase model. based on the results, all three variables had statistically significant effects on consumers’ intentions of using islamic financial products. moreover, it was found that the “attitude” variable affected the intention of using islamic financial products more than the other two variables. research limitations/implications: as the testing of the ase model was the main purpose of this study, the results are limited to the variables of the model. originality/value: this study is distinguished from other studies in the relevant literature by the virtue of its two aspects. first, in terms of context, this study deviated from conventional finance and focused on the topic in relation to islamic finance. second, this study tested the ase model that had not been previously tested empirically in the context of islamic financial products. this model discusses the effects of the variables of attitude, social influence and self-efficacy on behavioral intention, and it deviates from theory of reasoned action- and theory of planned behavior-based behavioral models that have been tested previously in several fields because it focuses on the cognitive aspect of consumers. while previous behavioral models regarding the use of islamic financial products have based their research on the affective aspect of relationships between variables, the ase model prioritizes the cognitive aspect. © 2022, emerald publishing limited."
"the present study aims at ranking the various factors which affect the stock selection decisions of retail investors in the indian stock market. further, the research provides valuable insights into the different factors that affect the stock selection decisions of the equity investors. for this purpose, the data were collected from 168 retail equity investors dealing in the indian stock market. “fuzzy analytic hierarchy process” was applied to rank the various factors affecting the stock selection decision of individual equity investors trading in the indian stock market. the primary factors considered for the study are accounting information, ownership structure, company-specific attributes, image of the company/board of directors, fundamentals of stock, trading opportunities, and sensitivity of stock and behavioral factors. the findings of the study revealed that behavioral factors, trading opportunities, and accounting information were the three most influential criteria. the five most influential sub-criteriums were, “i invest in those stocks which are affordable in terms of price (c52),” “i invest in the company's stock based on the recent price movement of stock (c51),” “i select the stock based on the sensitivity of company's stock performance to overall market performance (c62),” “i invest in the stock based on the trend of major indices (c61),” and “i prefer to invest in stocks which are evaluated by well-known experts (c80).” the present research has been carried out on a limited sample size which truly represented the total population; still, it is considered as the limitation of the study. the outcome of this research will provide investors with a better understanding of various factors that influence their stock selection decision. the study provides them a guideline on different factors; they should take into consideration, while undergoing the stock selection decision. the present research study enriches the literature on behavior finance from emerging markets. © 2021 john wiley & sons ltd."
"findings from brain sciences show that the brain must first optimize on its own internal resources before seeking to optimize on the resources available in the external world. we show that this modest change in perspective, from resource-constrained humans to resource-constrained brains, provides a new perspective on how assets are priced in financial markets. we show that the brain-centric perspective potentially lowers the risk aversion needed to reconcile consumption data with asset prices and can contribute to countercyclical equity premia. we show that the brain-centric perspective can be easily integrated with several existing approaches on the equity premium puzzle. © 2021 the institute of behavioral finance."

"although the msmes sector received relatively sufficient funding from commercial banks, this funding could not bring significant vertical growth to the sector due to different factors. this study is therefore aimed at investigating the repressing factors of commercial banks financing to msmes. to achieve the objective, survey data from 411 micro, small, and medium enterprises owner-managers in ethiopia were collected using a random sampling technique. the confirmatory factor analysis (cfa) and structural equation model (sem) result revealed that the total effect of bank finance on the performance of micro, small, and medium enterprises is less than its direct effect due to the competing mediation effect of behavioral finance. moreover, the result revealed that the relationship between bank finance and performance of micro, small, and medium enterprises was not significantly moderated by the gender of owners and the size of enterprises. the result implies that commercial banks should (1) assess the behavior of owner-managers and (2) deal with it before sanctioning loans to ensure the efficient utilization of accessed funds. © 2020 journal of the canadian council for small business and entrepreneurship/conseil canadien de la pme et de l’entrepreneuriat."
"background: changes in lifestyle, finances and work status during covid-19 lockdowns may have led to biopsychosocial changes in people with pre-existing vulnerabilities such as major depressive disorders (mdds) and multiple sclerosis (ms). methods: data were collected as a part of the radar-cns (remote assessment of disease and relapse—central nervous system) program. we analyzed the following data from long-term participants in a decentralized multinational study: symptoms of depression, heart rate (hr) during the day and night; social activity; sedentary state, steps and physical activity of varying intensity. linear mixed-effects regression analyses with repeated measures were fitted to assess the changes among three time periods (pre, during and post-lockdown) across the groups, adjusting for depression severity before the pandemic and gender. results: participants with mdds (n = 255) and ms (n = 214) were included in the analyses. overall, depressive symptoms remained stable across the three periods in both groups. a lower mean hr and hr variation were observed between pre and during lockdown during the day for mdds and during the night for ms. hr variation during rest periods also decreased between pre- and post-lockdown in both clinical conditions. we observed a reduction in physical activity for mdds and ms upon the introduction of lockdowns. the group with mdds exhibited a net increase in social interaction via social network apps over the three periods. conclusions: behavioral responses to the lockdown measured by social activity, physical activity and hr may reflect changes in stress in people with mdds and ms. remote technology monitoring might promptly activate an early warning of physical and social alterations in these stressful situations. future studies must explore how stress does or does not impact depression severity. © 2022 by the authors."

"the authors investigate the empirical relation among investor sentiment, valuation uncertainty, and announcements of changes in analyst recommendation decisions among u.s. firms. recent behavioral finance evidence shows market sentiment to have predictive content that affects the classical relationship between analyst recommendations and stock return dynamics. contrary to this evidence, the authors find that degree of valuation uncertainty is associated to the impact of investor sentiment when examining a likelihood of consensus recommendation upgrade or downgrade. while not totally eliminating the significant investor sentiment effect under high valuation uncertainty, the investor sentiment does not powerfully explain the stock market reactions to analyst recommendation changes under low valuation uncertainty. furthermore, the authors show that analyst recommendations provide significant buy or sell signals if valuation uncertainty is great, referring to the market being highly competitive. however, in less competitive markets, analyst reports become less informative. overall, the authors demonstrate that magnitude of valuation uncertainty is an important complement to investor sentiment for further understanding analyst recommendations. © 2021 the institute of behavioral finance."

"peer-to-peer (p2p) lending uses two-sided platforms to link borrowers with a crowd of lenders. despite considerable diversity in crowdlending research, studies in this area typically focus on several common research topics, including information asymmetries, social capital, communication channels, and rating-based models. this young research field is still expanding. however, its importance has increased considerably since 2018. this rise in importance suggests that p2p lending may offer a promising new scientific research field. this paper presents a bibliometric study based on keyword co-occurrence, author and reference co-citations, and bibliographic coupling. the paper thus maps the key features of p2p lending research. although many of the most cited papers are purely financial, some focus on behavioral finance. the trend in this field is toward innovative finance based on new technologies. the conclusions of this study provide valuable insight for researchers, managers, and policymakers to understand the current and future status of this field. the variables that affect new financial contexts and the strategies that promote technology-based financial environments must be investigated in the future. © 2021, the author(s)."
"real estate markets are known to be less-than-efficient for many reasons, but what roles short-term trading plays are unclear. do short-term investors bring additional risk to the market and cause prices to deviate from fundamental values? based on an extensive dataset of property transactions and a policy shock that substantially raised the cost of short-term trading in hong kong, we estimate ‘real estate risk’ with and without short-term trading based on return predictability, return volatility, and price dispersion. our results show that as short-term investors exit the market, market returns are less predictable and less volatile, while prices are less dispersed cross-sectionally. consistent with herding models in behavioral finance, the findings suggest that short-term investors are momentum traders who do not enhance price efficiency. © 2022 elsevier inc."
"listed companies with similar or related fundamentals usually influence each other, and these influences are usually reflected in stock prices. for example, the momentum spillover effect in the behavioral finance theory describes the formation of lead-lag effects between the stock prices of related companies. the relationship between listed companies consists of many types, such as relationships in the industry chain, industry information, transaction information, patent sharing degree, equity, etc. we construct a set of industry chain knowledge graph of listed companies to describe the production and supply relationship between the upstream and downstream of listed companies. then, graph representation learning method is used to study the relevance between listed company entities in the knowledge graph. it includes dimensions such as industry and transaction information of listed companies as weights to optimize the graph representation learning process, and finally calculates the similarity index between listed companies. to evaluate the effectiveness of the method, we conduct a link prediction experiment and construct a stock quantitative investment portfolio based on the similarity index. the result of the quantitative backtest experiment based on china’s stock market data in the last 10 years shows that the graph representation learning method we proposed can be used to study the momentum spillover effect and obtain investment returns. © 2022, the author(s), under exclusive licence to springer science+business media, llc, part of springer nature."
"the impact of behavioral biases and personal traits of the ceo on corporate decisions and performance has become the important agenda for management, governance and finance research. but still the empirical evidence on the influence of behavioral biases on the implementation of sustainability principles into company’s strategies is missing not only in emerging markets, but for developed markets as well. we aim to fulfill this gap by findings on the role of behavioral characteristics of a ceo and how they affect the effectiveness of the esg (environmental, social and corporate governance) approach to company management in one of the largest emerging capital market of russia. we first focus on ceo’s optimism, narcissism, self-confidence, and the lack of confidence of the ceo and their impact over esg performance. to identify behavioral biases, we use textual analysis and the “bag of words” method applied to the written letters to the shareholders by ceos of russian companies in 2017–2019 on a sample of 38 companies with official external esg ratings. our results confirm a significant influence of optimism and narcissism on the effectiveness of the esg approach, but self-confidence does not appear to be statistically significant. moreover, our findings prove significance of some personal traits such as industry experience and technical educational background. our findings validate and complement prior research on personal characteristics of ceos and provide novel data on the impact on esg in emerging capital markets. © 2022, national research university, higher school of econoimics. all rights reserved."
"we examine the effect of selected limit order tools (stop loss, take profit, and trailing stop) on the disposition effect, a well-known behavioral bias, by using experimental trading data. our presumption is that the limit orders should significantly eliminate this behavioral bias, which may lead to higher losses than feasible for a trader. the traders of our data sample can be considered as a sample of beginners or less informed traders. based on our analysis it is possible to conclude that limit orders have a significant impact on the disposition effect. traders using these tools were able not only to avoid this behavioral bias, but even reverse it, which is, as far as we know, a unique result within the existing literature. moreover, we found out that the impact of eliminating of the disposition effect by limit orders use is positive, as it may lead to significant loss reduction. on the other hand, the effect on profits is insignificant. © 2021 the institute of behavioral finance."

"investor sentiment is an important factor that affects stock prices, stock market returns, and asset pricing. however, the fluctuation patterns and factors influencing investor sentiment have received less attention from scholars. this study uses text messages from stock investors’ social networks and natural language processing techniques to reveal sentiment fluctuation laws of stock market investors. an investor confidence index (ici) is constructed by quantifying sentiment in investor messages on social networks. by taking this index as a proxy for sentiment, we measure the candidate fluctuation periods of investor sentiment using a fourier transform. the significance test then determines the significant cycle of investor sentiment within seven days. based on this, cluster analysis further reveals that investor sentiment in the 7-day cycle has a 5 + 2 cycle of variability. that is, from monday to friday, investor sentiment is disturbed by stock market sentiment showing profit-seeking and risk-averse preferences, while during the weekend holiday, stock market disturbance to investor sentiment becomes lower, investor sentiment is substantially higher, and volatility is narrowed, showing a typical holiday effect. the analysis also shows that the recurring cycle of 5-day trading days and 2-day holidays is a direct exogenous factor contributing to the 7-day cycle of investor sentiment. this study provides a new perspective for studying “investor sentiment,” “day of the week effect,” and “behavioral finance.” © 2022 the authors"
"at present, there is a common overinvestment behavior among listed companies in various countries, which seriously reduces the overall resource allocation efficiency of the market. with the rise of behavioral finance, it has become a new direction to study the influence of managers’ “irrational characteristics” on enterprise overinvestment. with the rapid rise of the media industry, media reporting, as an external governance mechanism, supplements the capital market supervision system and has a huge impact on the investment behavior of enterprises. how media reports affects overinvestment and whether it can curb overinvestment caused by managers’ overconfidence is still worthy of further study. this paper took 6,012 a-share listed companies from 2013 to 2021 as samples, and based on the perspective of “media reports,” studies the impact of managers’ overconfidence on overinvestment; explores whether positive and negative media reports have a moderating effect between overconfidence and overinvestment; studies the moderating effect of media reports under different marketization processes. empirical conclusions: (1) managers’ overconfidence will lead to overinvestment of enterprises. (2) positive media reports will aggravate the overinvestment caused by managers’ overconfidence; negative reports can inhibit the overinvestment caused by managers’ overconfidence. (3) in regions with higher marketization, positive media reports play a more significant role in aggravating overconfidence and leading to overinvestment; in regions with lower marketization, negative reports play a stronger role in restraining overconfidence and overinvestment. copyright © 2022 so."
"to achieve successful investments, in addition to financial expertise and knowledge of market information, a further critical factor is an individual’s personality. decisive people tend to be able to quickly judge when to invest, while calm people can analyze the current situation more carefully and make appropriate decisions. therefore, in this study, we developed a multimodal personality-recognition system to understand investors’ personality traits. the system analyzes the personality traits of investors when they share their investment experiences and plans, allowing them to understand their own personality traits before investing. to perform system functions, we collected digital human behavior data through video-recording devices and extracted human behavior features using video, speech, and text data. we then used data fusion to fuse human behavior features from heterogeneous data to address the problem of learning only one-sided information from a single modality. through several experiments, we demonstrated that multimodal (i.e., three different signal inputs) personality trait analysis is more accurate than unimodal models. we also used statistical methods and questionnaires to evaluate the correlation between the investor’s personality traits and risk tolerance. it was found that investors with higher openness, extraversion, and lower neuroticism personality traits took higher risks, which is similar to research findings in the field of behavioral finance. experimental results show that, in a case study, our multimodal personality prediction system exhibits high performance with highly accurate prediction scores in various metrics. © 2022 by the authors."

"objective: this paper explores the impact of media sentiment on stock prices on the shanghai stock exchange science and technology innovation board (hereinafter the star market) from a behavioral finance perspective. methods: we collect baidu news coverage of star-listed firms as the text, and measure text sentiment using a machine learning-based text analysis technique. we then empirically examine the impact of media sentiment on star market stock prices from two aspects: ipo pricing efficiency and ipo first-day stock performance. results: (1) media sentiment has no significant impact on ipo pricing efficiency, thus suggesting that institutional investors participating in such offerings are generally not affected by media sentiment. (2) optimistic media sentiment has a positive impact on ipo first-day returns, which indicates that individual investors are more easily influenced by media sentiment and therefore likely to abandon their rational judgment. (3) media sentiment had a greater impact on ipo first-day returns during the covid-19 pandemic than those before it, which suggests that individual investors are more influenced by media sentiment during pandemics. discussion: our findings deepen the understanding of stock price formation on the star market, which provide a statistical basis for formulating policy directions and investment strategies. copyright © 2022 dong, xu, liu and tsai."

"this book will provide a firm foundation in the understanding of financial economics applied to asset pricing. it carries the real world perspective of how the market works, including behavioral biases, and also wraps that understanding in the context of a rigorous economics framework of investors' risk preferences, underlying price dynamics, rational choice in the large, and market equilibrium other than inexplicable irrational bubbles. it concentrates on analyses of stock, credit, and option pricing. existing highly cited finance models in pricing of these assets are covered in detail, and theory is accompanied by rigorous applications of econometrics. econometrics contain elucidations of both the statistical theory as well as the practice of data analyses. linear regression methods and some nonlinear methods are also covered. the contribution of this book, and at the same time, its novelty, is in employing materials in probability theory, economics optimization, econometrics, and data analyses together to provide a rigorous and sharp intellect for investment and financial decision-making. mistakes are often made with far too often sweeping pragmatism without deeply knowing the underpinnings of how the market economics works. this book is written at a level that is both academically rigorous for university courses in investment, derivatives, risk management, as well as not too mathematically deep so that finance and banking graduate professionals can have a real journey into the frontier financial economics thinking and rigorous data analytical findings. © 2022 walter de gruyter gmbh, berlin/boston. all rights reserved."
"purpose: the purpose of this study is to prove that narratives can be a adequate foundation for human behavior in general and economic behavior in particular using the donald duck universe as an example. design/methodology/approach: by using a content analysis, the authors examine 208 stories of the donald duck universe to prove that economic behavior is already embedded in modern narratives of the 20th century. findings: this analysis shows that behavioral finance effects are identified in a total of 52.4% of the analyzed comics. this study furthermore distinguishes the main comic characters donald duck and scrooge mcduck and finds that eight of the nine considered behavioral finance biases can be detected in both. the most striking effect for donald duck is overconfidence and for uncle scrooge loss aversion. social implications: collectively, these comics provide potential exemplars for behavioral finance. regardless of whether these comics depict human nature or merely reflect human behavior during that time, they inevitably contribute to the understanding that psychological and sociological influences determine behavior in addition to economic factors that can be used for academic teaching. originality/value: in summary, comics, such as the donald duck universe, are suitable narratives for behavioral finance. © 2022, emerald publishing limited."
"our research investigates the potential benefits of adding the behavioral finance approach to the machine learning and big data framework applied to the challenging problem of forecasting the us dollar exchange rate. more specifically, we show how to improve existing voting-based ensemble models trained to predict the next-day exchange rate trend with no need for retraining or other costly computational tasks. we assume that calendar effects would constrain investors’ actions; furthermore, their constrained individual actions would collectively induce deterministic patterns in the financial time-series movement. hence, financial time-series forecasting models could be prone to monthly repeat their performance patterns, and we could use this information to obtain better predictions and consistently achieve profit. to verify the effectiveness of our methodology, we predicted the sign of the us dollar to brazilian real rate variation. our proposed models generated a profit metric value 24% higher than the original voting-based ensemble models with 16% lower volatility, gathering two positive elements: higher return with lower risk. the experiments’ outcomes supported the hypothesis that there are considerable improvements with almost no extra computational effort by taking into account behavioral patterns in foreign exchange predictions. © 2022 elsevier ltd"

"this paper applies the time varying parameter-vector autoregression model to explore the dynamic relationship between economic policy uncertainty, investor sentiment and financial stability in china in different periods and at different time points. the empirical results show that economic policy uncertainty has an obvious negative impact on investor sentiment before 2012 and financial stability in the short term, and the influence of economic policy uncertainty on investor sentiment is greater than that of economic policy uncertainty on financial stability. these influences were more significant during the period of the global financial crisis in 2008. moreover, investor sentiment had a positive and gradually increasing effect on financial stability, while after 2010, the positive impact gradually weakened. furthermore, economic policy uncertainty is negatively affected by financial stability, and the effect of financial stability on investor sentiment is positive. in terms of mediating effects, economic policy uncertainty has an indirect impact on financial stability through investor sentiment and vice versa. this paper provides a new solution to economic problems explored in behavioral finance research. additionally, chinese government agencies can achieve the goal of preventing financial crises and maintaining financial stability by monitoring investor sentiment and implementing targeted economic policies. © 2021, the author(s), under exclusive licence to springer-verlag gmbh germany, part of springer nature."
"individuals are susceptible to financial uncertainty across the financial life cycle. the last of three financial life cycle stages is the distribution of accumulated wealth to fund retirement. individuals maximize utility by smoothing consumption over the life cycle while managing uncertainty events. life cycle events include the potential need and financial cost for long-term care support and services. pre-cautionary savings are used to exchange insurance premiums for the coverage of high uncertainty events. despite the theoretical need for uncertainty protection, consumer demand for insurance that mitigates or eliminates risk exposure to uncertainty events is historically low. this conundrum is commonly referred to as uncertainty “puzzles.” the empirical and descriptive literature examines many potential factors for these protection gaps that range from financial, health, social insurance, substitute and complimentary assets, socio-demographic factors, individual preferences, behavioral, and psychosocial factors, which this current paper controls for a majority. research is growing yet limited when considering individuals personality traits as potential explanations for personal finance behaviors. this study investigates and provides results that suggest that personality traits could partially explain the low demand for financial uncertainty insurance. of the five personality traits, an individual who more strongly identifies with conscientiousness, holding all else equal, was found to associate positively with long-term care insurance ownership. © 2021"
"financial counselling and income-maximisation services have the potential to reduce financial hardship and its associated burdens on health and wellbeing in high income countries. however, referrals to financial counselling services are not systematically integrated into existing health service platforms, thus limiting our ability to identify and link families who might be experiencing financial hardship. review evidence on this is scarce. the purpose of this study is to review “healthcare-income maximisation” models of care in high-income countries for families of children aged between 0 and 5 years experiencing financial difficulties, and their impacts on family finances and the health and wellbeing of parent(s)/caregiver(s) or children. a systematic review of the medline, embase, psycinfo, cinahl, proquest, family & society studies worldwide, cochrane library, and informit online databases was conducted according to the preferred reporting items for systemic reviews and meta-analyses (prisma) statement. a total of six studies (five unique samples) met inclusion criteria, which reported a total of 11,603 families exposed to a healthcare-income maximisation model. an average annual gain per person of £1661 and £1919 was reported in two studies reporting one scottish before–after study, whereby health visitors/midwives referred 4805 clients to money advice services. in another uk before–after study, financial counsellors were attached to urban primary healthcare centres and reported an average annual gain per person of £1058. the randomized controlled trial included in the review reported no evidence of impacts on financial or non-financial outcomes, or maternal health outcomes, but did observe small to moderate effects on child health and well-being. small to moderate benefits were seen in areas relating to child health, preschool education, parenting, child abuse, and early behavioral adjustment. there was a high level of bias in most studies, and insufficient evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of healthcare-income maximisation models of care. rigorous (rct-level) studies with clear evaluations are needed to assess efficacy and effectiveness. © 2022 by the authors. licensee mdpi, basel, switzerland."

"background numerous studies have compared self evaluation and market values of apartments by employing hedonic regressions. most of these studies demonstrated that self evaluation of apartments are typically overly optimistic. yet, none of these studies explored the relationship between self-evaluation of apartments and obesity as a proxy for self esteem, particularly among women. previous empirical evidence suggests weight discrimination against women in employment and income, education and romantic relationships. following the influence of western values and norms regarding a slim body image of women and the implications of these social obesity penalties, one would anticipate a lower self evaluation of apartment value among obese women. another strand of the literature shows that compared to men, women are more conservative financial investors. objectives to explore gender differences in self-evaluation of apartments with respect to bmi (= weightheight2=kgmeter2where bmi≥ 30 is defined as obese person) as a proxy for self esteem. in an economic rational domain, housing price evaluations are not expected to be influenced by personal characteristics (such as gender, wealth, employment marital and immigration status, number of children) and psychological features of the evaluator. consequently, the current study is closely related to the literature that deals with real estate and behavioral finance and economics. methods we analyze a representative sample of the israeli population, obtained from the 2015–2016 longitudinal survey carried out by the israeli central bureau of statistics (icbs), where the responses of each individual were recorded twice (during 2015 and 2016). the survey includes information on weight and height of each family member, from which the bmi measure is calculated (weight ÷ height2), as-well-as apartment value, gender and a long list of economics and socio-demographic control variables, and apartment characteristics. to investigate this research question, we use a 2sls methodology, and run the empirical model separately based on ethnic origin and gender. results findings suggest that for both genders, bmi is negatively correlated with self-evaluation of apartments. yet, compared to men, female self-evaluation of housing prices are more conservative and less influenced by bmi changes. this outcome is obtained despite the fact that as part of the modern western societies, jewish israeli women are more susceptible to weight gain. research findings thus support the conclusion that the evaluation of women are more conservative and risk averse. moreover, with respect to obesity, compared to males, the cognitive error in price evaluation is smaller among females. © 2021, the author(s), under exclusive licence to springer nature b.v."

"behavioral science has made a considerable contribution to finance. to gain an understanding of the scientific contributions emerging from all fields of finance with a behavioral perspective, this paper reviews the content of the major journal dedicated to behavioral finance, the journal of behavioral and experimental finance (jbef), since its foundation 8 years ago. for this purpose, we employ bibliometrics and content analysis to shed light on the publication trends and intellectual structure of the jbef, obtaining numerous intriguing findings. first, the jbef is still a young journal, and its numbers of publications and citations have grown significantly since its inception. second, though there are contributions from all parts of the world, the united states is acknowledged as contributing the most to the jbef. diverse authors have contributed to the journal, but those affiliated with the university of innsbruck and macquarie university lead the list. third, most of the studies have used the theoretical underpinnings of behavioral theory and prospect theory. methodologically, most of the studies are empirical and primarily based on quantitative research designs, archival data and regression analysis. fourth, the jbef's contributions concern eight intellectual clusters—namely personal characteristics and national cultures; psychological factors, financial literacy and robo-advising; investor sentiment and stock market volatility; asset market experiments; overconfidence and the disposition effects in the stock market; externalities (covid-19) and financial markets; socially responsible investing; and herding behavior in financial markets. finally, “behavioral finance” is the most prominently used author keyword in the jbef's publications, followed by “financial literacy” all in all, these findings should offer readers a retrospection of scholarly contributions from the jbef. © 2022 the author(s)"
"as of early 2022, seven of the ten largest firms in the world by market capitalization had been funded through various types of entrepreneurial finance. this handbook provides an up-to-date survey of what we know about this significant phenomenon in all its forms, and where our knowledge about it needs to head from here. the handbook embraces a wide range of established and emerging academic and practitioner voices across the globe to explore the theoretical and practical flux and tension in the field. until recently, most studies have taken a supply side perspective, focusing on the perspective of those who provide funding to new ventures. this book takes a different, demand side perspective, beginning with the entrepreneur and gradually broadening our view to include close by and then more distant funding sources. following this approach, it is organized into four parts detailing the individual level (founders' resources, bricolage and bootstrapping, effectuation and portfolio entrepreneurship); the inner circle (informal financing, business groups, incubators and accelerators); the wider world (formal debt, microfinance, venture capital, corporate venture capital, business angels, government funding and family offices); and emerging perspectives (non-western perspectives, gender, indigenous perspectives, post-conflict and disaster zones and ethics). the introduction considers the general state of the field, while the conclusion takes on additional topics relevant to entrepreneurial finance, such as decentralized finance, big data, behavioral economics, financial innovation and covid-19, as well as possible ways in which entrepreneurial finance can have a greater impact on other disciplines. this handbook will be a core reference work for researchers, practitioners, and policy makers seeking an up-to-date academic survey of entrepreneurial finance. it can also be used as a primary text in ph.d. seminars in entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial finance, and finance. instructors in master's level courses in entrepreneurial finance and venture capital will also find the book of benefit. © 2022 walter de gruyter gmbh, berlin/boston."
"purpose: upgrading in global value chains (gvcs) has become a crucial strategy for enhancing competitive advantage and attaining higher profitability, especially among firms in developing countries. drawn from the sociological approach, this study treats gvc upgrading as an entrepreneurial act and examines factors affecting firms' intention to move up in their chains based on the theory of planned behavior. the authors also further test the moderating effects of firms' knowledge about rule of origin and governmental supports on the intention-behavior gap. design/methodology/approach: in-depth interviews with eight vietnamese business managers were implemented to support the development of hypotheses and measurement scales. afterwards, the authors conducted a survey on decision-makers of 402 vietnamese firms which currently have export-import activities to collect quantitative data for testing the hypothesized relationships. findings: the empirical results indicate that both attitudes, behavioral control and social norms have significant positive impacts on the intention to upgrade in gvcs. in turn, such intention could further activate actual behaviors to move up in their chains. however, those who have better knowledge about rule of origin and receive governmental supports either in terms of finance, credit or technology have a higher probability of demonstrating actual behavior to upgrade in gvcs once their intentions are formed than those who do not. practical implications: this research provides valuable implications for policymakers in accelerating firms' actions to upgrade within their chains, hence, actively enhancing not only organizational performance but also significantly contributes to the national economic development. originality/value: while most of the previous studies examine the preconditions for firms to participate and upgrade in their gvcs, there is limited attention on determinants of firms' own intention and actual behavior to upgrade in their chains once they have participated in the gvc. specifically, this research not only contributes to the existing knowledge regarding factors affecting firms' intention to upgrade in their chains but also closes the gap between the intention and the actual gvc upgrading behavior. © 2021, emerald publishing limited."
"major depression is associated with biased information processing and decision making. previous research suggests that people dealing with depression view the future negatively and exhibit a higher discounting rate than healthy people do. this study tests the hypothesis that depression is associated with financial planning horizon–the time horizon by which individuals and households formulate their saving and spending schedules. analyses conducted using data drawn from multiple waves of the health and retirement study showed an inverse association between major depressive episodes and financial planning horizon, indicating that depressed people plan their finances over a shorter horizon. we also found that major depression is associated with various health and financial outcomes representing evidence of myopic decision making. the link between depression and financial planning horizon is partially explained by depression-oriented differences in behavioral traits, such as optimism/pessimism, perceived control, perceived mastery, and self-assessed survival probability. overall, our findings point to a significant economic cost of depression, which compounds through myopic financial planning. © 2022"
"this article endeavors to investigate the application of machine learning in behavioral economics and behavioral finance to represent a profile of studies conducted in this field. to accomplish this task, 90 scientific studies were systematically extracted between 2000 and june 1, 2020. utilizing the text analysis techniques and related statistical methods, the abstracts of the extracted studies were reviewed and analyzed. first, it was found that attention to this field has developed in recent years with an accelerating trend. second, it was demonstrated that specialized journals have also bestowed more curiosity in these studies than in the past by publishing more relevant studies. third, results revealed that machine learning has been applied in areas such as investor sentiment, decision making, consumer behavior, trading strategies, game theory, and other areas in the field of behavioral economics and behavioral finance. in this regard, the application of machine learning has included techniques such as support vector machine, regression, neural networks, random forest, and so on. despite the expanding consideration adjusted to this field by researchers and specialized journals, there are still many research gaps in this field. accordingly, there is a relatively significant distance until fully unleashing the superior powers of machine learning, like prediction and classification in behavioral economics and behavioral finance. finally, this research completed its mission by suggesting implications for the future of this field based on the acquired outcomes. © 2022 with intelligence ltd."

"the modeling of risk and uncertainty in finance requires the consideration of several factors. one of the main factors in modeling is the decision-maker’s attitude towards risk. cumulative prospect theory (cpt) has emerged as an important approach for assessing the actions of decision-makers under uncertainty with ambiguity. considerable experimental evidence indicates that human behavior can differ significantly from the conventional expected utility maximization paradigm. cpt has the ability to model the irrationality of the decision makers’ behavior in real complex situations. this paper studies the portfolio selection problem based on the cumulative prospect theory (cpt) risk criterion. we encounter two types of risks during problem handling, first internal (imposed by risk management departments) and second external (accredited regulatory institutions). therefore, we propose a new cpt-based model for the portfolio selection problem under uncertainty with ambiguity. by taking some listed stocks from nifty-50, the national stock exchange, india, as the study sample, the efficient frontier for the proposed cpt-based model is generated. the empirical analysis compares the classical markowitz’s mean-variance efficient frontier with mean-variance values obtained by the proposed cpt-based efficient frontier. we also compare the investment performance of the behavioral investor with that of a rational investor. a detailed numerical illustration is presented to substantiate the proposed approach. © 2021, the author(s), under exclusive licence to springer nature switzerland ag."
"purpose: this study aims to critically review recent contributions to the methodology of financial economics and discuss how they relate to one another and directions for further research. design/methodology/approach: a critical review of recent literature on new methodologies for financial economics. findings: recent books have made important contributions to the study of financial economics. they suggest new approaches that include an emphasis on radical uncertainty, adaptive markets, agent-based modeling and narrative economics, as well as extensions of behavioral finance to include concepts such as diagnostic expectations. many of these contributions can be seen more as complements than substitutes and provide fruitful directions for further research. efficient markets can be seen as holding under particular circumstances. a major them of most of these contributions is that the study of financial crises and other aspects of financial economics requires the use of multiple theories and approaches. no one approach will be sufficient. research limitations/implications: there are great opportunities for further research in financial economics making use of these new approaches. practical implications: these recent contributions can be quite useful for improved analysis by researchers, private participants in the financial sector and macroeconomic and regulatory officials. originality/value: provides an introduction to these new approaches and highlights fruitful areas for their extensions and applications. © 2021, emerald publishing limited."
"while traditional finance focuses on the tools used to optimize return and minimize risk, this book shows how psychology can explain our decisions more than financial theory. analyzing how investors behave in the real world, this is the first book of its kind to delve into the ways biases influence investment behavior, and how overcoming these biases can increase financial success. now in its seventh edition, this classic text features: an easy-to-understand structure, illustrating psychological biases as everyday behavior analyzing their effect on investment decisions; and concluding with academic studies that show real-life investors making choices that hurt their wealth new content on fintech and cryptocurrencies, the role of social media in investing, generational biases, and the covid-19 pandemic experiential examples, chapter summaries, and end-of-chapter discussion questions to help readers test their practical understanding online supplements comprising powerpoint slides for both students and lecturers fully updated with the latest research in the field, the psychology of investing will prove fascinating and educational for advanced students in behavioral finance, investment and portfolio management classes, as well as investors and financial planners. © 2023 john r. nofsinger. all rights reserved."
"this article presents a dataset aiming to examine the nexus between financial well-being, financial behavior, and financial literacy in romania. a questionnaire-based survey was conducted on a representative sample of 1,391 respondents, selected through a multistage stratified random procedure. the questionnaire encompasses 34 questions aimed at uncovering individual abilities to manage personal finances, attitudes towards several financial instruments or techniques and financial knowledge. we construct one index for measuring financial well-being and three difficulty-ranked financial literacy indices. the indices are adapted to existing measuring techniques to allow for cross-country comparisons. the dataset connects research on the factors determining financial well-being, socio-economic characteristics or behavioral traits, with the measurement of financial knowledge and skills. the provided data can be used by policy makers in designing a national strategy of financial education, as well as by education providers and practitioners in their teaching process. the academy and researchers could also use this data to conduct inter-country financial analysis or studies at the aggregate level. © 2022"
"employees’ deviant behaviors in the workplace have caused organizations worldwide tremendous loss in terms of finance, reputation, continuity and employees’ well-being. the prevalence of workplace deviance and its negative consequences demands a compelling method to deal with this issue. in recent years, transparency has gained rising favor as an organizational principle and managerial goal, yet little was known about the effect of transparency on preventing workplace deviance, especially when it is perceived by employees. therefore, this research was conducted to explore the potential influence of perceived transparency on four different types of workplace deviance, namely production deviance, property deviance, political deviance, and personal aggression. ethical decision-making models were employed to understand the potential effect of perceived transparency on the process of an individual’s ethical decisions making and their behavioral outcomes. a survey was conducted on 203 full-time employees in various organizations located in taiwan. the results showed that perceived transparency can help to reduce production deviance, political deviance, and personal aggression. the effect of perceived transparency on property deviance was, however, not found. © 2022, srac - romanian society for quality. all rights reserved."
"the proponents of behavioral finance have always argued that managers are always irrational when making financial decisions. of late, some studies found that capital structure decision made are less than fully rational since it involved the human factor. in addition, the international diversification strategy of a company is said to also affect the capital structure decision. in lieu of this latest development, this study investigated the effect of ceo overconfidence and the international diversification strategy on capital structure’s decisions among shariah-compliant firms (scfs) listed in bursa malaysia. a two-step system generalised method of moments panel regression model was applied to an annual data of 200 scfs listed on bursa malaysia starting from 2009 to 2017. the empirical results revealed that overconfident ceos characterized as highly qualified, young and shorter-tenure ceos were aggressive in making the capital structure decisions. on the other hand, overconfident male ceos appeared to be less aggressive in making capital structure decisions. meanwhile, it was revealed that a company that is prone to an international diversification strategy tends to use less total debt and long-term debt. this could be due to the monitoring costs for internationally diversified firms to be probably more expensive than domestic firms. © 2022, universiti teknologi mara. all rights reserved."
"this research note investigates the stock market reactions of international hospitality firms to covid-19’s pandemic announcement by the world health organization. in line with the behavioral finance literature, the findings indicate that, in the short term, investors overestimated the risks underlying asset-heavy firms because of information uncertainty. firms pursuing an asset-light (al) strategy are associated to significantly less negative cumulative abnormal returns in the 4 days following the announcement, especially firms following an al strategy that reduces significantly the operating leverage. however, this difference vanishes after 5 trading days, meaning that investors revised their expectations. this research note suggests that the cost structure of al firms matters in reducing information uncertainty and sheds light on the consequences of the covid-19 crisis on the hospitality industry. it also provides useful information to board members, financial analysts, and companies’ top managers when evaluating whether and how to pursue an al strategy, and the potential consequences of it. © the author(s) 2021."
"as bibliometric approaches are increasingly a focus of literature reviews across different business disciplines, we apply a bibliometric approach to a review of bibliometric studies in finance, assessing 121 bibliometric studies. we identify four literature clusters: studies focusing on assessments of literature in trending topics; analysis of papers that employ emerging econometric techniques; studies grouped around particular fundamental topics such as market dynamics, behavioral finance, and corporate governance; and studies focused on retrospective celebration of single well-known finance journals. we identify which countries, institutions, and scholars have been being particularly influential. results suggest that the field of economics has been more comfortable publishing bibliometric studies than finance. results also identify the mainstream finance journals that are particularly leading in publishing bibliometric studies, with results showing that these journals have particularly high-growing scholarly impact. we conclude that bibliometric studies are an important vehicle for highlighting and motivating emerging scholarship. © 2021 elsevier inc."
"we use detailed assessments of ceo personalities to explore the nature of ceo overconfidence as it is commonly measured. longholder, the option-based measure of ceo overconfidence introduced by malmendier and tate (2005a) and widely used in the behavioral corporate finance and economics literatures, is significantly related to several specific characteristics that are associated with overconfident individuals as well as individuals with lower ability. similar relations hold for overconfidence measures based on ceos’ earnings guidance. investment-cash flow sensitivities are larger for both longholder and less able ceos. after controlling for ability and other characteristics, longholder ceos’ investments remain significantly more sensitive to cash flows. these results suggest that overconfidence, as measured by longholder, is correlated with lower ability but still reflects empirically distinct aspects of overconfidence. © 2021 elsevier b.v."

"achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 will require tackling both energy-related and non-energy-related ghg emissions, which can be achieved through the transition to a circular economy (ce). the focus of climate change crisis reversal has been on the energy-related continuum over the years through promoting renewable energy uptake and efficiency in energy use. clean energy transition and efficiency gains in energy use alone will not be sufficient to achieve net-zero emissions in 2050 without paying attention to non-energy-related co2 emissions. this study systematically reviews the ce literature across different themes, sectors, approaches, and tools to identify accelerators in transitioning to a ce. the study aims to understand and explore how technology, finance, ecosystem, and behavioral studies in the ce paradigm can be integrated as a decision-making tool for ce transition. the material analysis was carried out by identifying the main characteristics of the literature on ce implementation in the agriculture, industry, energy, water, and tourism sectors. results of the literature survey are synthesized to engender clarity in the literature and identify research gaps to inform future research. findings show that many studies focused on technology as an accelerator for ce transition, and more studies are needed regarding the ce ecosystem, financing, and behavioral aspects. also, results show that ce principles are applied at the micro-, meso-, and macro- (national, regional, and global) levels across sectors with the dominance of the industrial sector. the agriculture, water, and energy sectors are at the initial stages of implementation. additionally, the use of carbon capture and utilization or storage, conceptualized as a circular carbon economy, needs attention in tackling ce implementation in the energy sector, especially in hydrocarbon-endowed economies. the major implication of these findings is that for ce to contribute to accelerated net-zero emission by 2050, coordinated policies should be promoted to influence the amount of financing available to innovative circular businesses and technologies within an ecosystem that engenders behavioral change towards circularity. © 2022 by the authors."
"purpose: this article aims to clarify the mechanism by which herding behavior influences perceived market efficiency, investment decisions and the performance of individual investors actively trading on the pakistan stock exchange (psx). design/methodology/approach: the deductive approach was used in this study, as the research is based on the theoretical framework of behavioral finance. a questionnaire and cross-sectional design were employed to collect data from the sample of 309 investors trading on the psx. the collected data were analyzed using spss and amos graphics software. hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling (sem). findings: the article provides further empirical insights into the relationship between herding behavior and investment management and perceived market efficiency. the results suggest that herding behavior has a markedly negative influence on perceived market efficiency and investment performance, while positively influencing the decision-making of individual investors. originality/value: the current study is the first to focus on links between herding behavior and investment management activities and perceived market efficiency. this article enhances the understanding of the role that herding behavior plays in investment management and, more importantly, it improves understanding of behavioral aspects and their influence on investment decision-making in an emerging market. it also adds to the literature in the area of behavioral finance, specifically the role of herding behavior in investment management; this field is in its initial stage, even in developed countries, while little work has been done in developing countries. © 2022, emerald publishing limited."
"this study investigated the factors determining the behavioral intention of young saudi entrepreneurs to use crowdfunding to finance their small enterprises. the capacity of behavioral intention to predict the use behavior of crowdfunding platforms was also assessed. partial least squares-based structural equation modeling method (pls-sem) was used to analyze responses collected from 270 young saudi entrepreneurs (qualified students) attending the community college of abqaiq in saudi arabia, which is affiliated with king faisal university. the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (utaut) with extensions of three constructs was employed. the findings revealed that performance expectancy, social influence, perceived trust and perceived risks predicted the behavioral intention of young saudi entrepreneurs to use crowdfunding platforms to finance their small enterprises, whereas effort expectancy, facilitating conditions and trialability had no significant predictive effect on the same behavioral intention. it was further reported that behavioral intention could also predict the use behavior of young saudi entrepreneurs on crowdfunding platforms. the overall results indicated that the model explained 55.4% of the variance in behavioral intention and 38.3% of the variance in use behavior of young saudi entrepreneurs. © the author(s) 2022."
"although young adults are interested in finance, their financial competence, especially about the topic of retirement, is fairly thin. with a large sample of members of generation z (ages 18–25, n = 1,311), i explored whether young adults talk about retirement with others; and the correlates between talking about retirement and retirement preparation. participants reported whether they have spoken about retirement with nine sources: parents, siblings, other family members (non-parent; non-sibling), friends, significant others, co-workers, financial advisors, people on internet forums, and “other sources.” all participants reported to have discussed retirement with at least one source, with parents being the most common. young adults’ attitudes towards retirement preparation were largely positive. for example, participants acknowledged the importance of learning about retirement and experienced more positive than negative affect when thinking about retirement. behavioral measures of retirement preparation did not yield any effects, showing a potential gap between young adults’ retirement preparation attitudes and behavior. multiple regression analyses revealed that the effect of retirement conversations on retirement preparation varied by source. i tie the findings into past research and discuss practical implications. © 2021, the author(s), under exclusive licence to springer science+business media, llc, part of springer nature."
"background: digital mental health (dmh) tools use technology (eg, websites and mobile apps) to conveniently deliver mental health resources to users in real time, reducing access barriers. underserved communities facing health care provider shortages and limited mental health resources may benefit from dmh tools, as these tools can help improve access to resources. objective: this study described the development and feasibility evaluation of the emotional needs evaluation and resource guide for you (energy) system, a dmh tool to meet the mental health and resource needs of youth and their families developed in the context of the covid-19 pandemic. the energy system offers a brief assessment of resource needs; problem-solving capabilities; and symptoms of depression, anxiety, trauma, and alcohol and substance use followed by automated, personalized feedback based on the participant’s responses. methods: individuals aged ≥15 years were recruited through community partners, community events, targeted electronic health record messages, and social media. participants completed screening questions to establish eligibility, entered demographic information, and completed the energy system assessment. based on the participant’s responses, the energy system immediately delivered digital resources tailored to their identified areas of need (eg, relaxation). a subset of participants also voluntarily completed the following: covid-19 exposure and family impact survey (cefis) or covid-19 exposure and family impact survey adolescent and young adult version (cefis-aya); resource needs assessment; and feedback on their experience using the energy system. if resource needs (eg, housing and food insecurity) were endorsed, lists of local resources were provided. results: a total of 212 individuals accessed the energy system link, of which 96 (45.3%) completed the screening tool and 86 (40.6%) received resources. participant responses on the mental health screening questions triggered on average 2.04 (sd 1.94) intervention domains. behavioral activation/increasing activities was the most frequently launched intervention domain (56%, 54/96), and domains related to alcohol or substance use were the least frequent (4%, 4/96). the most frequently requested support areas were finances (33%, 32/96), transportation (26%, 25/96), and food (24%, 23/96). the cefis and cefis-aya indicated higher than average impacts from the pandemic (ie, average scores >2.5). participants were satisfied with the energy system overall (65%, 39/60) as well as the length of time it took to answer the questions (90%, 54/60), which they found easy to answer (87%, 52/60). conclusions: this study provided initial support for the feasibility of the energy system, a dmh tool capable of screening for resource and mental health needs and providing automated, personalized, and free resources and techniques to meet the identified needs. future studies should seek direct feedback from community members to further improve the energy system and its dissemination to encourage use. © colleen stiles-shields, kathryn r batts, karen m reyes, joseph archer, sharad crosby, janel m draxler, nia lennan, philip held."
"although recent evidence suggests that individual audit partners explain a substantial portion of the variation in audit quality proxies, much less is known about what determines an audit partner's quality. psychology and behavioral economics theories hold that an individual's experiences can have enduring impacts on subsequent behavior. we examine whether auditors' direct exposure to arthur andersen's collapse has a long-term impact on the quality of their audits. our evidence implies that audit partners who directly experienced andersen's demise impose stricter monitoring evident in their clients exhibiting a lower propensity for misstatements and small profits, and paying higher audit fees. importantly, these findings reconcile with research in finance and economics implying that firsthand experiences matter more to subsequent behavior than general economic conditions or secondhand or thirdhand experiences. collectively, the results shed light on one facet of how partners' audit quality evolves over time. our findings suggest that major failures associated with the audit firm in which an auditor works can ultimately result in these affected individuals later delivering higher audit quality, which should benefit audit committees in partner selection decisions and audit firms in designing partner assignment policies. © 2022 canadian academic accounting association."
"purpose: behavioral solutions to our cognitive biases have long been studied in the literature. however, there is still ample evidence of behavioral biases in decision-making, with only limited improvement in the medium/long term even when debiasing methods are applied. the purpose of this paper is to describe how financial investors could benefit from a proactive management of emotions combined with a set of learning and decision-making heuristics to make more efficient investments in the long run. design/methodology/approach: first, the authors offer a classification of the appropriate quantitative and qualitative methodologies to use in different ecological environments. then, the authors offer a list of detailed heuristics to be implemented as behavioral principles intended to induce more long-lasting changes than the original rules offered by the adaptive toolbox literature. finally, the authors provide guidelines on how to embed artificial intelligence and cognitive diversity within the investment decision architecture. findings: improvements in decision skills involve changes that rarely succeed through a single event but through a succession of steps that must be habitualized. this paper argues that implementing a more conscious set of personal and group principles is necessary for long-lasting changes and provides guidelines on how to minimize systematic errors with adaptive heuristics. to maximize their positive effects, the principles outlined in this paper should be embedded in an architecture that fosters cognitively diverse teams. moreover, when using artificial intelligence, the authors advise to maximize the interpretability/accuracy ratio in building decision support systems. originality/value: the paper proposes a theoretical reflection on the field of behavioral research and decision-making in finance, where the chief goal is to offer practical advices to investors. the literature on debiasing cognitive biases is limited to the detection and correction of immediate effects. the authors go beyond the traditional three building blocks developed by the behavioral finance literature (search rules, stopping rules and decision rules) and aim at helping investors who are interested in finding long-term solutions to their cognitive biases. © 2022, emerald publishing limited."
"the value function of the cumulative prospect theory is introduced into portfolio selection, and the traditional integer subscripts hesitant fuzzy linguistic set is improved from the perspective of behavioral finance. the improved variable subscripts hesitant fuzzy linguistic set can not only reflect investors' uncertainty about financial products, but also describe investors' psychological perception of gains or losses when giving evaluations. from the angle of single-investor multi-criteria evaluation, different stocks are quantitatively evaluated by the hesitant fuzzy language multi-criteria portfolio evaluation system based on variable subscripts. maximum returns and minimum risks hesitant fuzzy linguistic portfolio models are proposed for the three types of investors: aggressive, moderate and conservative. the optimal solutions of hesitant fuzzy language portfolio are obtained by solving the equivalent nonlinear models. finally, numerical simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed models and methods. © 2022 northeast university. all rights reserved."
"village funds are distributed to each village in the context of equitable development of the periphery. the amount of village funds puts financial accountability at high risk. therefore, the village financial system is needed to overcome this problem. this research was conducted based on a unified acceptance and use of technology (utaut) and technology readiness (tr) model to measure the acceptability and technological readiness of a village financial system (siskeudes). data were collected based on questionnaires distributed to village officials involved in siskeudes (finance), village secretaries, and programmers in the cirebon district, indonesia, using the partial least square method with smartpls 3.0. total samples comprised 39 respondents. results indicated that tr and social influence affect behavioral intention. social influence has a more significant effect than tr. this result showed that various people (such as friends or superiors) close to the users strongly influence the use of village apparatus for the village financial system. this study showed an in-depth understanding of the acceptance of siskeudes by integrating two models of social influence variables, namely, the utaut model and the theory of tr. © 2022, srac - romanian society for quality. all rights reserved."
"early investors possess unique sets of decision-making characteristics. they are more open to experience and eager to face risks. however, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, the discussions of nascent investors upon making the investment decision and its eroding biases were still elusive. the vital role of emotion as a bias in decision making was also inadequately addressed. this study enhanced behavioral finance knowledge by examining emotion’s role in regulating the illusion of control, overconfidence, and investors’ decision making. in total, 456 initial investors in indonesia participated in online questionnaires, forming the data for covariance-based structural model analysis. this study found that emotion significantly increased the illusion of control, but not overconfidence or decision making, contrary to the bulk of previous studies. the illusion of control exhibited a substantial significant effect of as much as 86.4% toward overconfidence, followed by a considerable increase in decision making. the results of our study also pointed to the unique chain effects of biases affecting the decision-making process of nascent investors in the emerging market. this finding implied they possessed a unique bias mechanism in constructing their decision. © 2022 by the authors."
"today, artificial intelligence (ai) can use the most powerful edge computing systems in the internet of things (iot) for finding the information extracted from vast sensory data such as cyber effects or models in physical environments for classification, identification, and prediction. heterogeneous iot devices produce isolated and dispersed information parts, and knowledge sharing and exchange in iot intelligent applications with several selfish nodes are necessary for complex tasks. in both academia and business, iot is driving a digital revolution. however, protection and iot privacy problems are challenged. it offers comfort for everyday lives. blockchain, a shared cryptographic database, is a promising iot encryption solution for several manufacturing, finance, and trade sectors. the iot-based blockchain architecture is an interesting contrast to the conventional, centralized paradigm that struggles to fulfill specific iot requirements. new concepts for applying data and resources management protection procedures in distributed networks and cloud computing are introduced. cloud management services can be linked to the application through blockchain technology and distributed leader, a stable cognitive information system that facilitates management operations and securing data. this document provides many ideas for applying personal and behavioral characteristics to security and cryptography protocols, blockchain based on the cognitive cloud computing (bc-ccc) pattern. the simulation result shows that the proposed strategy can significantly enhance data transmission rate (96.2%), security ratio (94.5%), throughput ratio (92.4%), scalability ratio (91.5%), trust rate (93.8%), data trading ratio (96.2%), and reduce storage cost rate (25.1%) compared to other existing methods. © world scientific publishing company."
"well-established studies in behavioral finance confirm that investors are highly influenced by subjective reference points when making economic decisions. although the literature examines reference point formation for individual stocks based on observed price sequences, the stocks are often treated without considering market context. we extend this literature by incorporating market price information as background to the behavior experiment, and we consider both prospect theory and anticipation/disappointment-based utility functions in a combined framework to investigate the impact of market context on reference point formation. our article provides new evidence and insights for investment practitioners and behavioral researchers. © 2022 the authors. journal of financial research published by wiley periodicals llc on behalf of the southern finance association and the southwestern finance association."
"the heterogeneous agent model (ham) is a powerful tool to study the stock price dynamics and stylized anomalies in financial markets, such as the volatility clustering and long-range dependence of stock returns. the existing hams often require the perfect arbitrage condition and relatively strong behavioral assumptions on agents’ expectation formation, which are not sufficient to capture the complexity in real finance market. to fill the theoretical gap, we propose a novel continuous version of ham that relies on weaker assumptions, in which heterogeneous agents are identified continuously by their wealth and the ex-post price expectations no matter how they are formed. given the non-parametric distribution on the continuous agent space and the bounded arbitrage condition, we establish the joint evolution equations for stock price and wealth distribution. within the family of mixed-exponential distributions, we derive an explicit expression for the equations and prove that the evolution equation of wealth distribution has the fascinating splitting-mixing property. an endogenous generating mechanism for agent types arises naturally from the splitting-mixing property, which links the continuous ham to the classical hams with finite agent types. by numerical simulation, we show that the wealth dynamics tends to positively associate the weight of each generated agent type with their averaged investment performance, while the price dynamics experiences the period-doubling bifurcation and chaotic bifurcation. by introducing random shocks into the continuous ham, we fit the resulting return series via a garch model. based on the significance of the fitted garch parameters, a wide range of model parameters are identified by which the continuous ham can simultaneously generate volatility clustering, long-range dependence and other stylized anomalies in financial markets. © 2021 elsevier ltd"
"purpose: this study examines the predictors of behavioral intention of farmers to adopt a mobile agricultural finance application called e-agrifinance using the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (utaut) and perceived cost as an additional predictor. design/methodology/approach: using a questionnaire survey, data are collected from 337 farmers in sarawak, malaysia. the collected data are analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modelling (pls-sem). findings: the research finds that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions are positively related to behavioral intention to adopt the e-agrifinance app, with social influence being the strongest predictor. perceived cost is also found to be positively related to behavioral intention which contradicts the prediction of the model. research limitations/implications: this study contributes to the use of utaut in predicting the adoption of mobile agricultural finance applications among farmers. practical implications: for practice, this study provides implications for the sarawak government to promote digital and financial inclusivity for all communities. this study also provides insights into important features of the e-agrifinance app for digital finance providers to develop the apps that will be well accepted by farmers in the future. originality/value: this research is one of the few studies that focused on farmers' mobile technology adoption in agribusiness from the perspective of an emerging economy. © 2021, emerald publishing limited."
"theoretical basis: this case draws upon the literature on appropriate leadership behaviors that yahoo’s founders or ceos could have adopted. it discusses the process of environmental analysis that would have an impact on yahoo!’s strategy. it discusses and depicts the levels of environmental analyzes that yahoo! as a firm ought to have undertaken in mapping its competitive environment. further, this case discusses transformational leadership factors and those behavioral traits that exemplify each of these factors. finally, the four elements of aspiration in discussing future firm direction are identified. these include an appropriate vision translated into a clarifying mission reflected in specific objectives grounded in explicit value statements. research methodology: this case is based on secondary data sources that include official company records, online reports and commentary, newspaper reports, public interviews and books. all such information has been appropriately referenced. case overview/synopsis: yahoo!, in its 22 years of existence, has demonstrated remarkable tumult. it has witnessed a succession of six ceos, exhibited a roller coaster trajectory in its stock price and, for the most part of its existence, played “catch-up” with its strategic competitors. it has also struggled to define its core purpose, its industry category and its very essence of being. in early 2016, ceo marissa mayer announced that yahoo! would be willing to sell its core internet business and that its board would “engage on qualified strategic proposals.” however, the board also reiterated that turning around yahoo! to prosperity continued to remain a top priority. what went wrong, so terribly wrong, with yahoo! in an otherwise lucrative industry? does yahoo! suffer from a fundamental, essential malaise which, if addressed, could restore it to wealth and vibrancy? this case focuses on the period 1994, the inception of yahoo!, to early 2016. the acquisition of yahoo! by verizon, completed in 2017, is not to be considered for purposes of this case study. complexity academic level: this case is particularly suited to be taught in a capstone strategic management course for mba/master’s level business students, after they have been exposed to core courses in marketing, business law, accounting, supply chain, corporate finance. it may also be taught in an advanced strategy course for undergraduate business students, typically in their final year of study. finally, this case can be used to teach senior management in executive management programs. © 2021, emerald publishing limited."
"indian journal of finance (ijf) is one of the most prominent research sources in finance, with a rapidly growing popularity in india and throughout the globe. on the journal’s 15th anniversary (2007 to 2021), this study venerated the journal by providing a detailed retrospective analysis of its output using variate bibliometric tools. performance analysis revealed a diminishing number of annual publications and growing citations in ijf, illustrating its increasing standards and growing reputation. bibliographic coupling, content analysis, and thematic review provided the details of various themes that have evolved in the indian journal of finance. the major themes that emerged from papers published in the ijf over the study duration cover: financial inclusion and financial literacy, social and environmental disclosure, stock market efficiency, investor behavior and financial wellbeing, financial crises, corporate governance, volatility, the spillover effect, and capital structure and dividend policy decisions. the journal’s keyword analysis and temporal evolution veraciously showed the recent publication trends and focus of the indian journal of finance. the study discovered the focal areas where most of the papers are published to address contemporary behavioral finance and empirical finance issues covering deep-impact research on the diverse research composition of ijf. we believe that the structural summarization of the published articles will significantly help practitioners espouse corporates’ financial strategies and decisions. it also provided useful future directions to the researchers in all the respective themes for further examination. © 2022, associated management consultants pvt. ltd.. all rights reserved."
"during the“14th five-year plan” period, financial services were actively integrated into the new business forms of e-commerce development, in which financial investment vigorously promoted the efficient allocation of capital elements, so as to construct a service system suitable for the development of e-commerce, it is not only an important opportunity to meet the needs of the digital economy and expand its own development space, but also provides strong support for the high-quality development of e-commerce. momentum strategy is a classical behavioral finance investment strategy. securities liquidity is the key factor affecting the return of momentum strategy. based on this, this paper studies the impact of securities liquidity on momentum investment strategy returns by using empirical analysis. we find that the impact of securities liquidity on portfolio returns is different with the change of investors' holding period, and the momentum winner portfolio and loser portfolio returns are asymmetric under the influence of liquidity. the results of this study not only provide alternative paths for the practitioners to choose more effective momentum investment strategies, but also facilitate the deep integration of e-commerce and financial services from the perspective of investment. © 2022 international conference on information systems, icis 2022: ""digitization for the next generation"". all rights reserved."
"purpose: the paper aims to examine whether financial advisors can understand the symbols and meaning that investors associate with money and whether such ability plays any role in enhancing the advisor-investor relationship in terms of satisfaction, level of trust, referral propensity and loyalty. design/methodology/approach: the authors used a dyadic research design. a total of 186 dyads of financial advisors and their clients took part in the study and completed two parallel self-administered questionnaires. findings: the authors found that financial advisors often can detect the emotional associations that their clients attribute to money. such ability can enhance their relationship with investors. research limitations/implications: the main limitation of this study is its exploratory nature and the convenience sampling technique that was adopted. therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the main findings further. practical implications: the results have implications for the development of ad-hoc psychological training to enhance the relationship between financial advisors and investors. understanding the symbolic meanings and the emotions that clients associate with money may be a prerequisite for a financial services company to succeed and be competitive in the sector. originality/value: despite acknowledging that money is not a neutral object but is layered with symbolic meanings and emotional associations, the behavioral finance literature has so far neglected to study these implications from either a theoretical or a practical point of view. this paper aims to fill this gap by investigating the symbolic value of money in the financial services industry. © 2022, edoardo lozza, cinzia castiglioni, andrea bonanomi and federica poli."
"purpose: the study attempts to assess the relationship between sociodemographic factors and the risk tolerance level of stock market investors reflected by their trading behavior from the perspective of developing market economy. design/methodology/approach: the study collected data from a survey on capital market investors in bangladesh. portfolio beta has been used as a dependent variable to measure the risk tolerance level where total 11 sociodemographic factors have been used as independent variables. findings: among all study variables, three sociodemographic factors are found to be significant in differentiating the risk tolerance level of the stock market investors. the author finds that the risk tolerance level of stock market investors significantly varies according to marital status, family size and financial responsibility. practical implications: as sociodemographic characteristics provide a basis in assessing the investor risk tolerance level in the context of developing market economies, the study suggests that stock market related policy and investment management planning process should be formulated by incorporating behavioral aspects of the retail investors. originality/value: this study has the potential to contribute to the behavioral finance literature by showing how and at what extent sociodemographic factors may influence the risk tolerance level of stock market investors in developing countries, where sociodemographic factors are considered to be more dominating than the normative portfolio selection procedure because of lacking in investors' financial literacy and due to the presence of a weak regulatory as well as institutional framework. further, apart from identifying and comprehensively incorporating all possible sociodemographic factors, this study uses portfolio beta as a new objective measure for financial risk tolerance, which overcomes the problem of subjective and other risk tolerance measurement in the existing literature. © 2020, emerald publishing limited."
"gold has the dual property of commodity and currency, which is an important means for investors to maintain and increase the value of assets. based on the behavioral finance theory, this paper adopts the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity mixed data sampling model (garch-midas) to explore the predictive ability of baidu index and google trend to the chinese gold price volatility. at the same time, global economic policy uncertainty (gepu) index and geopolitical risk (gpr) index variables are introduced to test the impact on gold volatility. furthermore, two evaluation methods, model confidence set (mcs) and direction-of-change (doc), are used to test the out-of-sample prediction accuracy of each model. this study employs the closing price data of au (t+d) gold deferred trading contract with large trading volume as the research object. the sample interval from january 4, 2011 to december 31, 2019, and a total of 2,186 daily data are obtained from the csmar database. the monthly data of baidu index is from http://index.baidu.com, and the monthly data of google trends is from https://trends.google.com/trends/. we obtain the monthly data of gepu and gpr from http://www.policyuncertainty.com. based on the empirical results of the mcs and doc tests, the garch-midas-google model performs the best predictive power than other competing models, which means google trends contain more useful information for the chinese gold price volatility. moreover, our results are robust to different forecasting window. therefore, our findings provide a new perspective for predicting china's gold volatility, provide a reliable guarantee for stable financial stability, and provide valuable information for policy makers. © 2022, editorial board of journal of systems engineering society of china. all right reserved."
"objectives: three different out-of-pocket (oop) maximums in medicare part d have been proposed: $2000 by the house of representatives, $3100 by the senate finance committee, and the beginning of catastrophic coverage by the medicare payment advisory commission. however, little is known about how beneficiaries would be affected. study design: we estimated multivariate linear regression models to determine which beneficiary characteristics were associated with the greatest savings under each proposed oop maximum and simulated a potential behavioral response by beneficiaries. methods: using part d 2017 claims data for beneficiaries in stand-alone prescription drug plans (pdps) and medicare advantage prescription drug (ma-pd) plans, we estimated the number of beneficiaries affected, their demographic characteristics, and their drug utilization patterns. we then simulated a potential behavioral response by beneficiaries. results: under the $2000 oop proposed threshold, only 7% of pdp and 4% of ma-pd plan beneficiaries would have spending high enough to reach the oop maximum. annual mean (sd) savings would be $1301 ($1849) for pdp beneficiaries and $1363 ($1888) for ma-pd plan beneficiaries, concentrated among beneficiaries taking specialty drugs. as the threshold increases, fewer beneficiaries would accrue savings, but savings would increase. for the highest proposed oop maximum, mean (sd) savings would be $2720 ($3465) and $2473 ($2805) for pdp and ma-pd plan beneficiaries, respectively. in our simulations, we estimated that the number of beneficiaries affected by an oop maximum could increase by 2% to 11%, depending on the magnitude of response, but changes in savings would be minimal. conclusions: as currently drafted, proposed oop maximums would reduce oop spending for a small population of part d beneficiaries, with savings concentrated among beneficiaries with the very highest costs who are taking specialty medications. © 2022 ascend media. all rights reserved."
"we apply dynamic programming principle to discuss two optimal investment problems by using zero-sum and nonzero-sum stochastic game approaches in a continuous-time markov regime-switching environment within the frame work of behavioral finance. we represent different states of an economy and, consequently, investors’ floating levels of psychological reactions by a d-state markov chain. the first application is a zero-sum game between an investor and the market, and the second one formulates a nonzero-sum stochastic differential portfolio game as the sensitivity of two investors’ terminal gains. we derive regime-switching hamilton–jacobi–bellman–isaacs equations and obtain explicit optimal portfolio strategies with feynman–kac representations of value functions. we illustrate our results in a two-state special case and observe the impact of regime switches by comparative results. © 2020, springer science+business media, llc, part of springer nature."
"the authors examine the ways in which different personal characteristics of a ceo under the influence of ceo power may in turn affect personal risk-taking. agency theory states that managers have non-changing risk preferences and are either risk-averse or risk-neutral. however, there may be cases when managers are risk-seekers, and the power of executives is positively related to excessive risk-taking. additionally, agency theory assumes that ceos are homogenous in power use and ignores the difference between ceos in terms of personality traits, as well as their impact on corporate decisions. therefore, our aim is to focus specifically on the factors that connect ceo power to ceo risk-taking and to analyze the possible effects of this relationship on a firm. based on both psychological and managerial studies, we conclude that, on the one hand, a ceo’s power can affect their personal traits by producing [in the case of overconfidence or hubris] or enhancing them [in case of narcissism]. on the other hand, ceos’ personal traits affect their risk-taking. it can occur either through changing risk perception or due to behavior patterns inherent in those traits. finally, we hypothesize that ceo power can affect ceo personal risk-taking through personality traits. by examining the relationship between ceo power and ceo risk-taking based on individual-level determinants, our paper adds to the behavioral corporate finance and corporate governance literature. © 2022, national research university, higher school of econoimics. all rights reserved."

"the preference for land urbanization of local governments promotes urban sprawl, which leads to the dilemma of land finance dependence (lfd) of local governments and the negative constraints on the ecosystem of urban areas in china. however, how the urban growth boundary (ugb) policy corrects local governments’ reliance on land finance has not been discussed in depth. in july 2014, the ugb policy began to be piloted in fourteen cities in china, providing a setting to further reveal the effectiveness of the ugb policy. by constructing an evolutionary game simulation model to clarify the behavioral strategies that local governments tend to adopt in the context of the ugb policy implementation, this study proves that the effective implementation of the ugb policy, by controlling the urban land capacity, can help solve local governments’ lfd dilemma in china. the ugb policy consists of a set of technical means and policy tools that controls urban sprawl. it breaks the “unlimited land capacity” situation faced by local governments in china by limiting the urban land capacity within a given period of time, and has become a new solution to the dilemma of lfd. the implementation of the ugb policy highlighted the shortage of urban land, which has led to the increasing cost of land finance for local governments and constraints on local governments’ lfd behavior. the shortage has also forced local governments to adjust and optimize their fiscal revenue structure. the ugb policy induced ongoing evolution in the benefit distribution among relevant entities in land finance, motivated local governments and other entities to adjust their primary strat-egies, and made it possible to address the dilemma of lfd in china. © 2022 by the authors. licensee mdpi, basel, switzerland."
"this study dynamically captures the trend changes in a firm's profitability over a period and explores the impact of the firm's profitability growth and acceleration on the cross-section of stock returns. the empirical evidence reveals a significantly positive dynamic profitability growth and an acceleration premium in the chinese stock market, which are still robust in the out-of-sample test. the significantly positive predictive information contained in the dynamic profitability (dp) is not subsumed under the profitability level at a certain point in time. moreover, the first-order dp growth has the strongest pricing power among the profitability strategies. we can obtain a higher excess return while simultaneously combining the dynamic and static profitability factors. in addition, this study provides ample evidence for the source of profitability anomalies, based on the behavioral finance framework. the findings under this framework indicate the substantial contribution of irrational mispricing, rather than rational pricing based on risk compensation or q-theory, to the premium. this paper comprehensively explores the dp anomalies (fundamental characteristics of a firm), thus providing a novel perspective to better understand the pricing mechanisms of the emerging stock market and cultivate investors' philosophy on rational trading. © 2022 elsevier inc."
"behavioral finance is an evolving field that studies how psychological factors affect decision making under uncertainty. this study seeks to find the influence of certain identified behavioral financial biases on the decision-making process of investors in developing countries. this research examines the moderating effect of information asymmetry on the two most important and commonly used cognitive biases, namely anchoring bias and optimism bias and decision making and investigates whether risk perception mediates the relationship between them or not. quantitative research has been conducted using a structured questionnaire for data collection. after completing the pilot study, a questionnaire was designed and sent to investors via online channels. data has been collected from 317 real estate investors. mediation analysis has been performed using model 4 and moderation analysis by applying model 15 of process macros (hayes, 2017) for the interaction effect. the study investigated that both cognitive biases have a significant positive effect on investors’ decisions and risk perception also significantly mediates the relationship between them. consistency with other studies suggests that information asymmetry has a significant moderating effect. the proposed conceptual model provides insight into how investors’ decisions are influenced by behavioral biases in the real estate sector and enhances the understanding of cognitive biases in the real estate sector. this study is recommended for real estate investors and policymakers of emerging and developed countries. the current study is the first of its kind, focusing on cognitive biases on investment decisions with mediating role of risk perception and the moderating effect of information asymmetry. copyright © 2022 zhang, nazir, farooqi and ishfaq."
"in the last decade, there has been a robust increase in research using financial incentives to promote healthy behaviors as behavioral economics and new monitoring technologies have been applied to health behaviors. most studies of financial incentives on health behaviors have focused on adults, yet many unhealthy adult behaviors have roots in childhood and adolescence. the use of financial incentives is an attractive but controversial strategy in childhood. in this review, we first propose 5 general considerations in designing and applying incentive interventions to children. these include: 1) the potential impact of incentives on intrinsic motivation, 2) ethical concerns about incentives promoting undue influence, 3) the importance of child neurodevelopmental stage, 4) how incentive interventions may influence health disparities, and 5) how to finance effective programs. we then highlight empirical findings from randomized trials investigating key design features of financial incentive interventions, including framing (loss vs gain), timing (immediate vs delayed), and magnitude (incentive size) effects on a range of childhood behaviors from healthy eating to adherence to glycemic control in type 1 diabetes. though the current research base on these subjects in children is limited, we found no evidence suggesting that loss-framed incentives perform better than gain-framed incentives in children and isolated studies from healthy food choice experiments support the use of immediate, small incentives versus delayed, larger incentives. future research on childhood incentives should compare the effectiveness of gain versus loss-framing and focus on which intervention characteristics lead to sustained behavior change and habit formation. © 2021 academic pediatric association"
"purpose: this study aims to develop two sentiment indices sourced from news stories and corporate disclosures of the firms in the national stock exchange nifty 50 index by extracting sentiment polarity. subsequently, the two indices would be compared for the predictive accuracy of the stock market and stock returns during the post-digitization period 2011–2018. based on the findings this paper suggests various options for financial strategy. design/methodology/approach: the news- and disclosure-based sentiment indices are developed using sentiment polarity extracted from qualitative content from news and corporate disclosures, respectively, using qualitative analysis tool “n-vivo.” the indices developed are compared for stock market predictability using quantitative regression techniques. thus, the study is conducted using both qualitative data and tools and quantitative techniques. findings: this study shows that the investor is more magnetized to news than towards corporate disclosures though disclosures contain both qualitative as well as quantitative information on the fundamentals of a firm. this study is extended to sectoral indices, and the results show that specific sectoral news impacts sectoral indices intensely over market news. it is found that the market discounts information in disclosures prior to its release. as disclosures in quarterly statements are delayed information input, firms can use voluntary disclosures to reduce the communication gap with investors by using the internet. managers would do so only when the stock price is undervalued and tend to ignore the market and the shareholder in other cases. otherwise, disclosure sentiment attracts only long horizon traders. practical implications: finance managers need to improve disclosure dependence on investors by innovative disclosure methodologies irrespective of the ruling market price. in this context, future studies on investor sentiment would be interesting as they need to capture man–machine interactions reflected in market sentiment showing the interplay of human biases with machine-driven decisions. the findings would be useful in developing the financial strategy for protecting firm value. originality/value: this study is unique in providing a comparative analysis of sentiment extracted from news and corporate disclosures for explaining the stock market direction and stock returns and contributes to the behavioral finance literature. © 2021, emerald publishing limited."
"research on financial well-being is still in its nascent stage, despite being an important topic in consumer research. research on the antecedents of financial well-being is even more limited. using in-depth interviews with consumers and practitioners, and expert discussions, this article conceptualizes the construct of financial well-being from underdeveloped countries' perspective. we conceive financial well-being as a confluence of four situations—namely, meeting present and future financial commitments; feeling of financial security; freedom of choice; and improved quality of life. our findings reveal that the objective and subjective financial measures are critical predictors of consumers' financial well-being. financial behavior, which is caused by antecedents such as financial knowledge, personality traits, and mindful finance, intervenes this relationship. based on this analysis, we propose five propositions concerning antecedent-based interventions for future scholarship in the field. the paper suggests a theoretical framework illustrating behavioral interventions in a given socio-economic environment to achieve financial well-being. our results pave the way for the advancement of the theory in financial-well being and its antecedents in different socio-economic environments. the managerial contribution of this study lies in informing the marketers to contextualize their strategies to the financial well-being. we also inform the macroeconomic policymakers to design behavioral interventions to improve the financial well-being. © 2020 john wiley & sons ltd."

"models for understanding stock markets mainly focus on fundamental and technical approaches, while also referring to behavioural finance, but little has been developed on psychological biases from a qualitative approach, particularly for small investors. given that information processing is easier for institutional players and that technical tools have very variable levels of operationality, the small investor is often left to his own devices, influenced by elements that go beyond the framework of rationality. our analysis focuses on behavioural biases involved by emotional fields that could influence the decision-making process of small investors. to this end, we mobilized a group of 15 students in a continuous trading situation during a stock market week. this experiment corresponded to a specific stock market context; nevertheless, the participants were subjected to emotional loads leading to the emergence of some behavioral biases. our conclusions showed that these biases can, in certain cases, induce a process of financial value creation. © 2022 iseor. all rights reserved."
"this research aims to investigate the effect of ceo characteristics (female gender, education, and age) on the financing policy (interest-bearing debt to total assets), investing policy (capital expenditure), and firm performance (return on assets) when it is controlled by firm size and firm age. our research uses the data of the manufacturing companies listed on the indonesia stock exchange (idx) in the period 2010-2017. the results of our research show that female ceos have a significant negative effect on financing policy. this has a significant positive effect on firm performance, but no significant effect on investing policy. we also found that ceo education negatively and significantly affects financing policy, but positively and significantly affects investing policy and performance. meanwhile, ceo age has a significant negative influence on financing policy but no significant influence on investing policy and performance. our research results support behavioral finance theory by providing empirical evidence that ceo behavioral aspects are correlated with the female gender, education, and age in terms of significantly affecting firm policies and performance. the implication of this research is that investors should know the ceo characteristics of the companies in which they invest their money because the ceo characteristics can be used as references to predict performance and ceo policy decision-making. © 2022, universiti malaysia sarawak. all rights reserved."

"purpose: the purpose of this paper is to determine if the failure of the securities and exchange commission (sec) to persecute madoff is, in fact, an ethical failure. the authors turn to the extension of aristotelian theory of moral values, virtue epistemology, to identify specific failures. the authors generalize this study’s conclusions to an overall responsibility of regulatory agencies to exercise epistemic virtues in their decision-making process. the authors explore how behavioral biases confound the execution of epistemic duty, and how awareness of behavioral biases can alleviate epistemic failures. the authors conclude this study with recommendations to prevent future frauds of madoff proportions. design/methodology/approach: the authors rely on recent advances in virtue epistemology and behavioral finance. the authors combine these two theoretical approaches to better understand the duty of competence inherent in being a finance professional, and even more so in being a regulator entrusted with overseeing financial industry, and psychological biases that may prevent finance professionals and regulators from performing this duty. findings: the paper concludes that the sec employees failed to exercise epistemic virtues in their handling of the complaints implicating madoff’s firm of fraud. this failure reveals a consistent pattern of behavioral biases in decision-making. the authors posit that knowledge of ethical theory, specifically virtue epistemology, as well as awareness of behavioral biases, which inhibit epistemically virtuous cognitive process, can improve the functioning of both finance industry and its overseers. the authors suggest that future finance professionals and regulators need to acquire this knowledge while pursuing their undergraduate education: it is the duty of business schools to facilitate this progress. originality/value: this paper combines the theory of virtue epistemology with the current knowledge of behavioral biases, which distort rational decision-making, to explain the failures of regulators to analyze fraud reports. the authors extend this finding to recommend the inclusion of the theory of virtue epistemology in business schools’ ethics curriculum. © 2021, emerald publishing limited."
"supply chain financing guaranteed by third-party logistics (3pl) firms is an effective way to solve the financing difficulties of small and medium-sized enterprises (smes). studies have explored factors that affect the willingness of supply chain financial credit providers under guarantee of 3pl firms (e.g., the scale of financing enterprises and credit). however, whether the scale of 3pl firms will affect the bank’s credit decision has not been studied, as well as the neural processing of credit decisions. to clarify these issues, this study extracted behavioral and event-related potentials (erps) data when participants performed a selection task of judging whether to grant credit to guaranteed financing-seeking enterprises according to the large or small scale of the 3pl guaranteeing firms. the behavioral results showed that under the condition of a large-scale 3pl guaranteeing firm, the willingness to provide credit to smes was higher than that under the condition of a small-scale 3pl guaranteeing firm. this finding indicates there was credit scale discrimination against 3pl guaranteeing firms in supply chain finance. the erp results showed that compared with the condition of a large-scale 3pl guaranteeing firm, a greater n2 amplitude was induced under the condition of a small-scale 3pl guaranteeing firm, which indicated that credit decision makers experienced greater perceived risk and more decision-making conflict. in contrast, a larger lpp amplitude was detected under the condition of a large-scale 3pl guaranteeing firm (as opposed to a small-scale firm), which indicated that large-scale 3pl guaranteeing firms received more positive comments and more positive emotions from credit decision makers than small-scale 3pl guaranteeing firms. based on these results, this study reveals the cognition process of credit decision makers regarding the impact of the 3pl guaranteeing firm scale on the willingness to provide credit in supply chain finance and explains the theory of credit scale discrimination from the perspective of decision neuroscience. copyright © 2022 wang, zhao, zhang and tang."

"purpose: this paper developed a theoretical and research framework by identifying the behavioral biases in investment decision and by presenting a review of the available literature in the field of behavior finance-related biases. this paper aims to present a compressive review of the literature available in the public domain in past five decades on behavior finance and biases and its role in investment decision-making process. it also covers insights on the subject for developing a deeper understating of the behavior of investor and related biases. design/methodology/approach: the work follows the comprehensive literature review approach to review the available literatures. the review carried out on different parameters such as year of publication, journal of publication, country, type of research, data type, statistical technique used and biases identified. this is a funnel approach to decrease the number of behavior biases up to six for further research. findings: most of the existing works have summarized behavior finance as an emerging area in finance. this indicates the limited valuable research in developing economy in this area. this literature review helps in identifying major research gap in this domain. it helps in identifying the behavior biases which work dominantly in investment decision-making. it would be interesting to explore the area of behavior biases and their impact on investment decision of individual investors in india. originality/value: this paper worked on literature prevailing on the subject and available on various online research data source and search engines. it covers a long time frame of almost five decades (1970-2015). this paper is an attempt to look at the impact of behavior finance and biases and its role in investment decision-making process of the investor behavior. this study builds up a strong theoretical framework for researchers and academicians by detailed demonstration of available literature on behavior biases. © 2019, emerald publishing limited."
"the credit risk of small and medium-sized enterprises (smes) in supply chain finance (scf) is defined as the probability that the sme would default on loans derived from financing for the scf platform. traditional models make use of merely the static data of smes, such as enterprise demographic data and financial statement data, to predict the credit risk of smes in scf. nevertheless, behavioral data, which reflect the dynamic financing behavior of smes in scf, are overlooked by these models, which limits the performance of credit risk prediction. to address this problem, a novel approach is proposed called deeprisk to fuse enterprise demographic data and financing behavioral data to predict the credit risk of smes in scf. we adopt the multi-modal learning strategy to fuse the two different sources of data. the concatenated vectors derived from data fusion are then used as the input of the feed forward neural network to predict the credit risk of smes. experiments on a real scf dataset demonstrate that the proposed deeprisk approach outperforms the baseline methods in credit risk prediction in terms of precision, recall, f1-score, area under curve (auc), and economic loss. the fusion of the two different sources of data is superior to the existing approaches to the credit risk prediction of smes in scf. both the static enterprise demographic data and the dynamic financing behavioral data are crucial to improve the credit risk prediction of smes. nevertheless, the variables derived from the financing behavioral data have a better predictability than those from the enterprise demographic data. managerial implications have been identified for decision makers involved in scf in utilizing the benefits of scf and in managing their credit risks. © 2022 elsevier ltd"
"background and aims: online interventions for problem gambling are increasingly popular, but not everyone benefits from them. we describe 12 years of real-world data from an online intervention for gambling problems and aim to find out the extent to which depression, alcohol use, and sense of financial control influence the effectiveness of the program. methods: we analyzed treatment effectiveness and moderators in the finnish ""peli poikki""program (2007-2018) - an 8-week cognitive behavioral therapy and follow-up program for problem gambling. participants were finnish-speaking adults over 18 years of age (n = 2011, 66.9% males). we measured the self-reported level of problem gambling, depression, alcohol use, and sense of financial control across four treatment phases (baseline, post-treatment, 6-month follow-up, and 12-month follow-up), as well as the presence of gambling debt, psychological and physiological health, years suffered from gambling problems, and demographic variables. results: participation grew across years with retention rates of 55%, 30%, and 19% for post-treatment and the two follow-ups, respectively. the average problem gambling scores declined significantly following treatment and remained low throughout the follow-ups. however, this decline (the beneficial treatment effect) was reversed after the follow-ups for those with high depression scores and those who felt they had no control over their finances. discussion and conclusions: the peli poikki program is a well-functioning online intervention but less effective in the long term for participants with persisting symptoms of depression or without a sense of financial control. more attention is needed to screen and direct people with comorbidities to the appropriate services. © 2021 the author(s)."
"behavioral economics provides valuable knowledges on the operation of economic agents, away from the conception of unlimited rationality. currently it applied in many areas of social life such as behavioral finance, neuromarketing, public policies, savings, public health, etc. games activity generates random significant economic results and the number of people who bet grows every year. in this scenario sports predictions must be analyzed from the insight provided by behavioral economics to understand the determinants of the decisions of individuals. the present study aims to analyze the presence of cognitive biases affecting the prediction of sports results. an experiment in theoretical orientation of pre-experimental type was designed with the participation of 66 subjects, who were to make estimates sports scores from 6 scenarios created. it can be concluded that sports predictions operate under the principle of limited rationality, presenting characteristics of intuitive thinking in decisions, as well as the representativeness heuristic and optimism biases, over-inference, hot hand and small numbers. the findings of this pre-experiment point to the presence of excess confidence in previous knowledge, experience and intuition, undervaluation of statistical information and influence of affective components in decisions about sports prediction. © 2022, universidad politécnica salesiana del ecuador."
"behavioral finance literature points out that managers' psychological convenience can influence firm value by inducing inefficient decision-making. this study examines whether the manager's over-investment in r&d at the time of ipo is likely to be the manager's optimistic over-investment from two aspects. first, we examine whether firms with high discretionary r&d expenditures in the ipo year are more delisted after ipo. second, we also examine whether the positive relationship between discretionary r&d expenditures and delisting in the ipo year differs depending on the auditor type. the results of analyzing and selecting 999 ipo firms newly listed on the kosdaq market from 2001 to 2015 as a sample are summarized as follows. first, we find that firms that overspent discretionary r&d expenditure in the ipo year is delisted more than other firms. these results suggest that discretionary r&d expenditure in the ipo year partially reflect the over-optimism of management. second, firms contracting with non-big4 auditors in the ipo year show a positive relationship between discretionary r&d expenditures and delisting. however, firms contracted with big4 auditors do not show a significant relationship. these results suggest that big4 auditors have a greater monitoring effect than non-big4 auditors in suppressing the over-optimism of ipo firms. overall, the results of this study suggest that ipo firms with weak external monitoring are likely to be in financial trouble due to risky investment propensity caused by manager's overconfidence and optimism. © 2022, korean accounting association. all rights reserved."

"aim: time outdoors and contact with nature are positively associated with a broad range of children’s health outcomes. pediatricians are uniquely positioned to promote active play in nature (apn) but may face challenges to do so during well child visits. the objective of this study was to understand barriers to children’s apn, before and during the covid-19 pandemic, and how health care providers could promote apn. methods: focus groups were conducted with 14 pediatric providers and interviews with 14 parents (7 in english, 7 in spanish) of children ages 3 to 10 on public insurance. dedoose was used for coding and content analysis. we contextualized this work within the who’s commission on social determinants of health conceptual framework. results: parents mentioned a range of material circumstances (time, finances, family circumstances, access to safe outdoor play spaces and age-appropriate activities) and behavioral/psychosocial factors (previous experiences in nature, safety, and weather concerns), many of which were exacerbated by the pandemic, that serve as barriers to children’s apn. providers said they were motivated to talk to families about children’s apn but mentioned barriers to this conversation such as time, other pressing priorities for the visit, and lack of resources to give families. conclusions: many pre-pandemic barriers to apn were exacerbated by the covid-19 pandemic. well-child visits may be an effective setting to discuss the benefits of apn during and beyond the pandemic, and there is a need for contextually appropriate resources for pediatric providers and families. © the author(s) 2022."
"gambling disorder is a behavioral addiction that negatively impacts personal finances, work, relationships and mental health. in this pre-registered study (https://osf.io/5ptz9/) we investigated the impact of real-life gambling environments on two computational markers of addiction, temporal discounting and model-based reinforcement learning. gambling disorder is associated with increased temporal discounting and reduced model-based learning. regular gamblers (n = 30, dsm-5 score range 3–9) performed both tasks in a neutral (café) and a gambling-related environment (slot-machine venue) in counterbalanced order. data were modeled using drift diffusion models for temporal discounting and reinforcement learning via hierarchical bayesian estimation. replicating previous findings, gamblers discounted rewards more steeply in the gambling-related context. this effect was positively correlated with gambling related cognitive distortions (pre-registered analysis). in contrast to our pre-registered hypothesis, model-based reinforcement learning was improved in the gambling context. here we show that temporal discounting and model-based reinforcement learning are modulated in opposite ways by real-life gambling cue exposure. results challenge aspects of habit theories of addiction, and reveal that laboratory-based computational markers of psychopathology are under substantial contextual control. © 2022 the author(s)."

"social trading platforms offer opportunities for amateur investors to copy professional traders' behavior. however, past studies on behavioral finance have largely neglected the role of personality in shaping traders' behavior. to this end, we aim to scrutinize the effects of leader traders' personality on their trading behaviors and subsequent performance on social trading platforms. particularly, we employ the myers-briggs type indicator (mbti) personality classification scheme to delineate leader traders' personality into the four dimensions of extraversion-introversion (e-i), sensing-intuition (s-n), thinking-feeling (t-f), and judging-perceiving (j-p). next, we draw on machine learning techniques to advance a novel text-based approach for extracting the personality dimensions of leader traders automatically. analytical results attest to the impact of personality dimensions on trading behavior and that of trading behavior on performance. findings from this study yield insights for both social trading platforms and followers by identifying profitable leader traders based on their personality. © 2022 28th americas conference on information systems, amcis 2022. all rights reserved."

"in this work, we argue for the importance of an online evaluation budget for a reliable comparison of deep offline rl algorithms. first, we delineate that the online evaluation budget is problem-dependent, where some problems allow for less but others for more. and second, we demonstrate that the preference between algorithms is budget-dependent across a diverse range of decision-making domains such as robotics, finance, and energy management. following the points above, we suggest reporting the performance of deep offline rl algorithms under varying online evaluation budgets. to facilitate this, we propose to use a reporting tool from the nlp field, expected validation performance. this technique makes it possible to reliably estimate expected maximum performance under different budgets while not requiring any additional computation beyond hyperparameter search. by employing this tool, we also show that behavioral cloning is often more favorable to offline rl algorithms when working within a limited budget. copyright â© 2022 by the author(s)"

"in recent years, employees′ unethical pro-organizational behavior (upb) has become a key research topic in the field of organizational behavior. upb refers to unethical behavior by employees with the intention to benefit the organization or its members, while violating core societal values, mores, laws, or standards of proper conduct. as a means of delivering ethical norms and standards, management ethical leadership can reduce employees′ upb through supervision and demonstration of acceptable behavior. however, leaders may also convey ambiguous and inconsistent ethical standards to employees and motivate them to engage in unethical behavior. therefore, the effectiveness of management ethical leadership in alleviating upb of employees has been challenged. to prevent and reduce upb more effectively, it is essential to further identify the inhibiting factors of upb and the relevant inhibition mechanisms. in chinese enterprises, union representatives represent a ‘ two-way transmission belt′ between the employer and employees, which serves as an alternative source for employees to acquire ethical behavioral norms in the workplace. however, existing research rarely examined the influencing factors of upb from the perspective of union ethical leadership. to fill this gap in existing research, this study introduces the concept of union ethical leadership and investigates its influence on upb. within the theoretical framework of “dual moral situations-individual behavioral response”, and drawing on the social cognitive theory of moral thought and action, this study asks three specific questions: (1) is union ethical leadership one of the inhibiting factors of upb? (2) to what extent does union ethical leadership alleviate upb in addition to the effect of management ethical leadership? (3) how does union ethical leadership exert its guiding and rectifying function at different stages when management ethical leadership affects upb? this study uses survey data collected in jiangsu, guangdong, shanghai, liaoning, anhui through the time-crossing method. the survey covers 341 employees from 18 enterprises from various industries (e. g., manufacturing, electricity, finance, and services); these enterprises have implemented democratic grassroots union elections or professionalization of union representatives. confirmatory factor analysis, hierarchical regression analysis, and simple slope test were adopted to test the research hypotheses by using stata 16.0. the empirical results show that: (1) management ethical leadership and upb follow an inverted u-shaped ( curvilinear) relationship, and union ethical leadership can directly alleviate upb while controlling the effect of management ethical leadership. this demonstrates that union ethical leadership can serve as an alternative way for employees to acquire moral clues and strengthen their sensitivity to certain moral issues in the workplace. (2) union ethical leadership negatively moderates the curvilinear inverted ushaped relationship between management ethical leadership and upb. as the level of union ethical leadership changes from low to high, the relationship between management ethical leadership and upb gradually weakens, which represents the “crowding-out effect” of union ethical leadership on the relationship between management ethical leadership and upb. (3) union ethical leadership changes the shape of the curvilinear relationship between management ethical leadership and upb. as the level of union ethical leadership changes from low to high, the curvilinear relationship between management ethical leadership and upb will transform into a negative linear relationship. this study holds that this is related to the characteristics of the survey data about democratic grassroots union elections or the professionalization of union representatives. under this condition, high-level union ethical leadership can not only repair but even reverse the shortcomings of management ethical leadership in alleviating upb. the theoretical and practical significances of this paper are listed in the following: first, from the perspective of union ethical leadership, this paper suggests that union ethical leadership plays an important role for enterprises to restrain employees′ upb, which resolves the theoretical deficiency of existing research regarding the inhibitory factors of upb and further deepens the research about upb. second, by proposing union ethical leadership as the situation variable and discussing its function of buffering and rectifying the curvilinear inverted u-shaped relationship between management ethical leadership and upb, this paper answers the call of researchers to conduct responsible research. in doing so, this paper moves beyond the current dominating focus on attitudinal predictors of upb, such as organizational identity and chronic regulatory focus, and provides an additional explanation for the moral dilemma of how to effectively alleviate upb. in addition, this study integrates the dual-actor perspective of management ethical leadership and union ethical leadership for exploring their synergy effect on upb. this approach helps to utilize a more comprehensive perspective on the literature on chinese management-union relations and the management practice of organizations intervening in upb. furthermore, this paper highlights the necessity for unions to keep in close touch with the ethical management of employees in the process of transformation, and offers valuable guidance for unions, employees, and employers regarding joint efforts towards building ethical organizations. © 2022, journal of industrial engineering and engineering management. all rights reserved."
"behavioral finance is one of the most novel developments in behavioral economics. since the end of the 1970s, a wide range of psychological, economic, and sociological laboratory and field experiments proved human beings deviating from rational choices and standard neoclassical profit maximization axioms that fail to explain how human actually behave. human beings were rather found to use heuristics in the day-to-day decision-making. these mental short cuts enable to cope with information overload in a complex world. behavioral economists proposed to nudge and wink citizens to make better choices for them with many different applications in very many different domains. this chapter reviews and proposes how to use mental heuristics, biases and nudges in the finance domain to profit from markets with particular attention to the role of information. © 2022, springer nature switzerland ag."

"background: mental health impacts of the covid-19 pandemic are well recognized, but little is known about the pandemic experience among people experiencing mental health symptoms. methods: in june 2020, a national sample of 5023 u.s. adults, including 785 scoring ⩾10 on the phq-8 for symptoms of depression, completed survey measures related to their pandemic experience. results: after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, aspects of the covid-19 pandemic experience for which participants scoring phq-8 ⩾ 10 had the greatest increase in odds of reporting moderate/severe negative impacts included: mental health treatment access (odds ratio [or], 95% confidence interval [ci] = 8.81, 6.70-11.57), family stress/discord (or, 95% ci = 5.21, 4.24-6.42), food access (or, 95% ci = 3.76, 2.97-4.77), and income/employment (or, 95% ci = 3.19, 2.66-3.83). they were also significantly more likely to report increased use of prescription painkillers (or, 95% ci = 8.46, 4.50-15.92) and other drugs (or, 95% ci = 4.43, 2.85-6.89), and less trust in healthcare authorities/providers, family/friends, and employers, and more trust in websites/blogs/social media, for covid-19 information (p-values <.05). conclusions: the interplay among depressive symptoms, substance use, lack of trust in healthcare authorities, and negative impact of the pandemic on family, finances, and access to mental health treatment and food indicate the need for robust social and behavioral health safety nets to buffer communities from the shadow epidemics of depression, family violence, and overdose deaths during public health disasters. © the author(s) 2022."
"the development of inclusive finance relies on central banks to innovate and use a variety of unconventional monetary policy tools to enhance the targeted regulation of specific areas. whether such unconventional monetary policies can target support to weak segments to alleviate the financing constraints of micro and small enterprises (mses) remains to be verified. therefore, to explore the inclusive financial effects of unconventional monetary policy, a favar model was constructed by using quarterly financial data from mses and panel data containing a combination of macro information and monetary policy in china from 2014 to 2020, the control effects of two types of unconventional monetary policy instruments, quantitative and price-based policies, on credit financing were analyzed. results show that the control effect of unconventional policies on the development of inclusive finance emerges gradually, mainly by guiding financial institutions to increase credit allocation to targeted mses and a certain extent extending the coverage of financial services to the real economy. however, the capacity of unconventional monetary policy regulation to alleviate the financing constraints of mses is still limited by the current credit principles and behavioral attributes of commercial banks that would otherwise serve mses. the conclusions provide empirical references for further optimizing unconventional monetary policy tools for targeted regulation of key areas and enhancing the capacity of inclusive financial services. © vilnius university, 2002-2022."

"objective: the present research aims to understand the role of behavioral biases present in the investment decision in entrepreneurs and managers, in the light of the behavioral finance. theoretical approach: considering that non-financial aspects influence the decision making of investments in real assets, the present research focuses on how individual characteristics, notably behavioral biases, can affect these investment decisions, from the perspective of behavioral finance. method: a qualitative research was developed. interviews were held with eight managers or entrepreneurs who usually make investment decisions in real assets within their organizations. interviews were transcribed and content analysis was used to analyze the data. results: findings suggest the presence of behavioral biases in the decision-making presented by the interviewees, specifically the optimism and overconfidence, loss aversion, self-attribution, sunk cost, endowment effect, regret, conservatism, and external agent effect. optimism, overconfidence, and loss aversion were present in all the interviewees’ speeches. regret and external agent effect emerged in entrepreneurs’ speech while conservatism bias emerged in the speech of managers. conclusions: entrepreneurs and managers indistinctly presented behavioral biases; however, the triggers for those biases are diverse. when it refers to insecurity in deciding, entrepreneurs allow themselves to question their own decision-making ability, by either regret or consulting an external agent, while managers hold themselves in conservative decisions. © 2022, anpad - associacao nacional de pos-graduacao e pesquisa em administracao. all rights reserved."

"the objective of this paper is to survey the literature from theoretical and the practical perspective of asset allocation and portfolio construction, and the ideal means of performing this mission is through portfolio management process. the efficient financial markets and behavioral finance are two different bases in which investors can evaluate best approach for asset allocation and security selection for a security. the efficient markets hypothesis is believed that market discounts all publicly available information, whereas, behavioral finance and neurosciences disprove because of irrational behavior of retail traders financial market become inefficient. experts believe that fundamental and technical analysis can help investors to evaluate market price movement of a security. this enables investors to make buy and sell decision that leads to a profitable trade. the portfolio management process decomposed into portfolio planning, portfolio construction, and portfolio evaluation phases. it helps identify what is risk tolerance and ability to take risk of an investors, what is the optimal weight of each security in the portfolio and what is the reasonable expected return based on market conditions.  © 2022 ieee."
"since the end of the 1970s, a wide range of psychological, economic, and sociological laboratory and field experiments proved human beings deviating from rational choices. standard neoclassical profit maximization axioms were outlined to fail to explain how humans actually behave. human beings were rather found to use heuristics in day-to-day decision-making. these mental shortcuts enable us to cope with information overload in a complex world. while in europe heuristics were more likely to be seen as evolutionary-grown decision-making aids to navigate a stressful environment, foremost north american behavioral economists proposed to nudge and wink citizens to make better choices with many different applications in multiple domains. this book will (1) start with a review of the contemporary literature on human decision-making failures in europe and north america presenting theoretical foundations and a wide range of nudges and winks developed to curb harmful consequences of humane decision-making fallibility. the book will then (2) propose how to use mental heuristics, biases, and nudges in the finance domain to profit from economic markets providing clear communication strategies for financial executives. (3) behavioral ethics toward inclusion and the behavioral economics of diversity will be presented as most novel advancement in the field of behavioral leadership. the monograph finishes with (4) clear leadership and followership directives on nudging in the digital age with particular attention to wise usership and the most recent developments on social media online data sharing in our post-covid-19 era. © 2022, springer nature switzerland ag."

"the strategic management field has produced various theoretical frameworks to explain the factors behind performance, success and failure, and behavior among firms. the most dominant theoretical frameworks are: the positioning school which argues that positioning in attractive industries is important (porter, 1980) and the resource-based view which argues that firm-specific resources and capabilities are the sources that create competitive advantage. inadequate explanations of the resource-based view regarding sustainable competitive advantages lead to the emergence of different perspectives. these perspectives are the natural resource-based view (hart, 1995), dynamic capabilities (teece et al., 1997), the knowledge-based view (grant, 1996), the relational view (dyer and singh, 1998), strategy as practice (whittington, 1996), the attention-based view (ocasio, 1997) and the institution-based view (peng, 2009). scholars argue that macro level analysis is not sufficient to explain the sources of competitive advantage (felin and foss, 2005), so they introduced to the strategic management field the micro-foundations of dynamic capabilities. micro-foundations focus on the effect of individuals (abell et al., 2008) and interpersonal interactions (hodgson, 2012) on firm behavior and performance. micro foundations perceive individuals as the most concrete and basic building block of a firm and attempt to understand and explain the behavior of firms through the behavior of individuals (laureiro-martinez, 2014). the continuation of micro-foundations has led to the development of the field of behavioral strategy. behavioral strategy combines psychology with strategic management theory and practice. the use of concepts and assumptions from the discipline of psychology in business and strategic management is not new. in previous years, psychological concepts such as the cognitive characteristics of the top management team (hambrick and mason, 1984), attention (ocasio, 1997), emotions (nickerson and zenger, 2008) and cognitive factors (walsh, 1995) were used in the field of business and strategic management. however, despite the efforts of these studies, the field of strategic management could not sufficiently benefit from neuroscience and psychology such as the finance and economics disciplines (bagis and hiziroglu, 2018). this deficiency has triggered behavioral strategy research in strategic management. the search for the foundations of behavioral strategy still continues. in this chapter, we argue that the explanations for cognitive and social psychology in the foundations of behavioral strategy alone are insufficient. we elaborate our claim with explanations that take into account the interaction between formal and informal institutions and cognition. this chapter is structured based on four sections; the first section discusses a literature review of behavioral strategy, the second section discusses behavioral strategy and institutions, and the third section is divided into two sub-sections relating to formal institutions and behavioral strategy, and informal institutions and behavioral strategy. the last section is the conclusion. © 2022 by nova science publishers, inc."
"this study aims to investigate the opinions of behavioral finance researchers, financial market professionals, and individual investors about the factors that can influence financial market professionals’ decision-making. we analyzed the answers from 10 behavioral finance researchers, 24 financial market professionals, and 26 individual investors to two open questions about cognitive triad and investment decision-making. we applied quantitative text mining techniques to the open answers and presented them in semantic network format. the main findings suggest that technical knowledge, economic scenario, and financial institutional governance are the main factors that influence financial market professionals’ decision-making in the overall sample. fear, behavioral biases, and euphoria are the main factors of the cognitive triad described as capable of influencing financial market professionals’ decision-making. however, there are divergences between the factors suggested by each group. we discuss and compare each of the main factors reported with findings from previous studies. furthermore, our results indicate that when questioning which factors can influence the financial market professionals’ decision-making, psychological factors are not the first to come to mind of market players. this may indicate the need for psychoeducational interventions inside financial institutions aimed at the importance and impacts of psychological factors during professionals’ investment decision-making. © 2022, associação brasileira de psicologia."

"the phenomenon of cryptocurrencies still requires systematic and in-depth scientific research, because the literature lacks a concentrate and systematic analysis on issue of private, decentralized digital money (cryptocurrencies) in relation to the future of traditional money, as well as the stability of the financial system. moreover, the is lack of research based on the opinions of participants of the financial system, which includes users – current and potential – as subjects relevant to the future of the financial system, based on the historically well-known principle of universal acceptance and trust in traditional monetary system. in particular, comparative and international research has received limited attention. in response to the identified research gap, this article refers to the results of research on the perception of cryptocurrencies by young financial market participants. we try to answer to the following research questions: 1) are there international differences in perceptions and attitudes toward the traditional monetary system and cryptocurrencies? 2) are cryptocurrencies constructed on the basis of blockchain a valid alternative to current fiat money? 3) do cryptocurrencies have characteristics that make them successors to fiat money? our work is based on the research material collected during surveys conducted before the outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic – in december 2019 and january 2020 – in germany and poland. the survey was conducted among 281 respondents – 143 from germany and 128 from poland. they were students of economics and finance majors of studies. the survey was conducted in the form of an auditorium questionnaire. the paper questionnaire used in the survey consisted of 26 questions related to virtual money and 5 questions of socio-demographic characteristics. in addition, the article used statistical methods – correlation and variance analysis – to characterize the distributions of responses and the relationships between questions. our findings lead to the conclusion that there are significant differences in perception, the traditional monetary system, and cryptocurrencies due to a variety of factors, which include the level of development of the economy, the innovation of financial markets, historical warranty and being their derivative the so-called collective consciousness (mentality). the obtained research results can be a starting point for further in-depth analysis of the studied phenomenon at the international level, not only in the sphere of economics and finance, but also behavioral finance, sociology and psychology. © 2022 narodowy bank polski. all rights reserved."
"in an impressive line of experiments and field studies, the growing field of behavioral finance has offered behavioral insights on how markets deviate from rationality. human actors are prone to base their investment choices on very many other factors than simply volatility and profit maximization opportunities. investors decisions tend to be biased by heuristics, which are covered in this chapter. the following part reviews some of the behavior insights gained in the last decades and shows ways how to profit from heuristics and biases. most recently, nudging has started using the emerging insights about human heuristics and biases to improve decision-making in different domains ranging from health, wealth, and prosperity. this part of the book explains some behavioral finance techniques that can be used to enhance your financial gain by diversification, investing in crises-robust, long-term sustainable market options, demographics-based forecasting, saving money through tangibility and safe havens, or reaping benefits from outperforming market strategies. the role of inflation and a low interest rate in markets will be considered from a behavioral consumer perspective as well as from a disparate impact analysis view. © 2022, springer nature switzerland ag."

"the global economy is growing faster and faster. behavioral finance is a transformation of financial theory. over the past decade, this shift has had strong repercussions in academia, challenging the dominance of traditional finance and forming its own theoretical system. with the development of the stock market, traditional financial theories and behavioral financial theories continue to converge, and traditional financial theories based on investor rationality and efficient market assumptions are subject to unprecedented conjectures. financial markets are affected by subjective factors such as people's behaviors and emotions. investors always make decisions based on bounded rationality, cognitive deficits, and, ultimately, rationality. in order to avoid the complex and unpredictable risks of financial markets and understand their changing laws, the analysis of the characteristics of financial instability is conducive to understanding the nature and internal principles of financial markets. analysis of the volatility characteristics of financial markets must give priority to the analysis of financial chronological order. financial time series are characterized by differences in financial markets, which are indeterminate orders, and the analysis of their fluctuations becomes crucial for stimulating the microstructure of financial behavior markets. therefore, in order to give full play to the role of edge computing and promote the controllability of behavioral financial market volatility, this paper used the calculation task load model algorithm, time slot length optimization algorithm, asymmetric thick-tail random fluctuation, and volatility analysis application algorithm to study the subject of how to learn to reduce financial market volatility, summarizing and discussing the experiment. the research results showed that the behavioral financial market volatility mechanism based on edge computing constructed in this paper improved the predictability of financial market volatility by 15%.  © 2022 xiaoliang yuan."

"the behavioral finance studies the human psychology behind investments in securities. this article investigates the investor’s predisposition toward heuristics over rational decision making in stock market. it also explores the impact of such intuitive-based decisions on the investment performance. the sample consisted of 410 registered individual investors of national stock exchange, india. the study is a novel one as it examines the compounding impact of heuristics of investors on investment behavior and prospects of earning desired return. the study finds that the investors emphasize more on heuristics than on rational decision-making process due to time and resource constraints. collection of detailed information about stocks followed by making meticulous analysis of alternatives prior to investment as envisaged in the mintzberg model is followed sparingly. the research concludes that every time the investors go for heuristics, they generate less return on their investment. multivariate analyses have proved the hypotheses. the implication of this study lies in educating the individual investors about the shortcomings of heuristics in investment decisions and its negative impact on the return on investment. further, investment advisors would stand to benefit of this research. © 2022, the author(s), under exclusive license to springer nature singapore pte ltd."
"stock price crash refers to the phenomenon that stock price or index declines sharply in a short term. the previous research on causes for stock price crash risk mainly discussed from the perspective of formal system. however, there are few discussions on the influence of the informal system linked by micro culture on stock price crash risk. according to the behavioral finance theory, culture can affect the micro enterprise decision-making and the construction of enterprise culture is a process of “internally rooted in mind and externally expressed in behaviors” for enterprise employees. one of the causes for stock price crash risk is that managers conceal the negative information. the motivation for such a decision-making behavior may be influenced by the enterprise culture or enterprise assessment method under a certain cultural norm. therefore, the influence of enterprise culture on stock price crash risk cannot be negligible. among many different characteristics of enterprise culture, competition culture is a type of enterprise culture that is relatively highly correlated with stock price crash risk. in accordance with the competition value framework, competition culture emphasizes the individual autonomy and independence, the view that individual achievements are superior to collective interests, and highlights that competitive companies usually require the productivity improvement and shareholder value realization within a short term. from the perspective of practical cases, the enterprise culture of enron corporation is “success only, results first” and the competition-oriented high pressure culture enforces the managers to misrepresent the performance and conceal the financial information for satisfying personal interest, which eventually leads to the collapse of enron corporation. theoretically speaking, firstly, the competition culture atmosphere may exacerbate the mistrust among members inside the organization, lead to the impossibility of reaching a consensus inside the enterprise, distort the kind reminders and amplify the risk factors in interpersonal relationship, which further underestimates the project risk and overestimates the returns. secondly, competition culture makes the internal members with inconsistent interests become more inclined to start from the perspective of self-interest realization and increase the agency costs. in order to avoid the forced termination of projects due to damages to shareholder interests, managers may conceal the negative information of investment projects, leading to over investment and other opportunistic behaviors. thirdly, under the competition system of “improve or quit”, out of career concerns, managers are more inclined to pursue for short-term benefits, report the positive information only and hide the negative information. when negative information is released in a centralized way, stock price crash risk can be triggered. contrarily, competition culture may also improve the effectiveness of internal enterprise supervision and increase information disclosure so as to restrain the stock price crash risk. in order to further clarify the influence mechanism of enterprise competition culture on stock price crash risk, in this paper, with non-financial listed companies in shanghai and shenzhen during 2010 and 2017 as samples, based on the annual report texts of listed companies, using text analysis method, the indexes to measure the enterprise competition culture are constructed and the influence of enterprise competition culture on stock price crash risk is researched. the research results show that the more enterprises emphasize competition in the annual report, the greater the risk of stock price crash is. after solving the possible endogenous problems using the double difference method and instrumental variable method, the conclusion remains robust. the mechanism test finds out that the conscious cultural construction and opportunistic behavior within enterprises are the potential channels to influence the stock price crash risk. further research indicates that the effect strength of competition culture is affected by industry competitiveness, staff layoff pressure and agency problems. generally speaking, this research expands the research on micro enterprise culture. compared to the previous digging on annual reports that are mostly based on the perspectives of information disclosure and management tones, competition culture is explored through annual reports in this paper, which owns a larger and more objective sample compared to questionnaire. this paper enriches the research on influence of micro enterprise culture on stock crash and overcomes the influence of system, geography, humanities and other interference factors between countries that are impossible for national culture to avoid, which enlightens the construction of enterprise culture of listed companies to some extent and provides theoretical foundation and empirical support for countries to formulate the policy and strategy of building a socialist cultural power. © 2022. all rights reserved."

"background: persons living with dementia require increasing levels of care, and the care model has evolved. the centers for medicare and medicaid services is transitioning long-term care services from institutional care to home- or community-based services, including reimbursement for nonclinical services. although home care companies are positioned to handle this transition, they need innovative solutions to address the special challenges posed by caring for persons living with dementia. to live at home longer, these persons require support from formal caregivers (fcgs; ie, paid professionals), who often lack knowledge of their personal histories and have high turnover, or informal caregivers (eg, family or friends), who may have difficulty coping with behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. the generation connect platform was developed to support these individuals and their formal and informal caregivers. in preliminary studies, the platform improved mood and influenced caregiver satisfaction. to enhance platform effectiveness, generation connect received a grant from the national institutes of health small business innovation research to improve clinical outcomes, reduce health care costs, and lower out-of-pocket costs for persons living with dementia who receive care through home care agencies. objective: this study aims to evaluate information elicited from a series of stakeholder focus groups to understand existing processes, needs, barriers, and goals for the use of the generation connect platform by home care agencies and formal and informal caregivers. methods: a series of focus groups were conducted with home care agency corporate leadership, home care agency franchise owners, home care agency fcgs, and informal caregivers of persons living with dementia. the qualitative approach allowed for unrestricted idea generation that best informed the platform development to enable home care providers to differentiate their dementia care services, involve informal caregivers, improve fcg well-being, and extend the ability of persons living with dementia to age in place. using the technology-enabled caregiving in the home framework, an inductive and iterative content analysis was conducted to identify thematic categories from the transcripts. results: overall, 39 participants participated across the 6 stakeholder focus groups. the following five overarching themes were identified: technology related; care services; data, documentation, and outcomes; cost, finance, and resources; and resources for caregivers. within each theme, the most frequent subthemes were identified. exemplar stakeholder group statements provided support for each of the identified themes. conclusions: the focus group results will inform the further development of the generation connect platform to reduce the burden of caregiving for persons living with dementia, evaluate changes in cognition, preserve functional independence, and promote caregiver engagement between these individuals. the next step is to evaluate the effectiveness of the revised platform in the national institutes of health small business innovation research phase 2 clinical trial to assess the efficacy of its evidence-based interventions and market viability. © 2022 jmir publications inc. all right reserved."
"this article studies the model of the impact of real negative news on stock prices and provides evidence using china's a-share listed companies as an example. it first defines the negative news of the network. then, it constructs the negative news to the stock price influence model, from the perspective of the theory of behavioral finance, the relationship between stock market and investor sentiment is systematically analyzed, and the theoretical support for the research of this paper is provided according to the definition of network negative news concept using the event study, abnormal returns test, regression analysis of the sample selected out of the study, observation of negative news before and after the abnormal returns, and excess returns changes. studies have shown that negative news before 1 day and after 4 days makes stock price volatility larger, resulting in excess returns. the network negative news on the listed company's stock price fluctuations can cause a certain degree of impact; in the short term, the fluctuation of the stock price of listed companies is more active. this article finds that when online media disclose negative information on listed companies from one day before to four days later, stock prices will fluctuate greatly, generate excess returns, and continue to make stock fluctuations more active in the short term. in addition, when studying the influencing factors of the stock price fluctuations of listed companies, we found that stock price fluctuations are affected by the company's performance. the better the company's performance is, the smaller the stock price fluctuations will be when it is affected by negative news. finally, we find that the higher the shareholding ratio of institutional investors in listed companies, the more stable the stock price.  © 2022 cheng chung wu et al."
"credit scoring is a significant research domain for both finance and computer science researchers. customers' loan application behavior is highly related to their future default performance, which requires more studies. this study applies a modified approach of sequential-pattern-mining-based classification to mine important and discriminant behavioral patterns of customers. and then, we use the patterns to predict customers' likelihood to default on a future loan. our approach specifically addresses the problem of data imbalance. evaluation based on real business data shows that our approach outperforms a series of time series classification methods, including deep learning models. in addition, such pattern-based classification approaches have the merit of explainability in features. specific patterns of customer loan applications are found to be related to their future default behavior. therefore, our method enhances the business understanding, provides managerial insights, and thus is more likely to be accepted by the industry.  © the authors."
"we adopt the cross-sectional absolute deviation model (csad) to test the herding behavior of chinext, a decade-old nasdaq-style stock market in china, based on its stocks from 2015-2019. our findings show that the herding behavior is prevalent, implying that such behavior is widespread in a relatively new stock market themed with growth-oriented innovative enterprises and dominated by individual investors instead of institutional investors. moreover, we find that herding tends to be more severe during the periods of falling market than rising market. we explain that several distinct attributes of the individual investors cause them to sell during the falling market, an act contrary to the standard account of the “disposition effect of holding the losers” in behavioral finance. we contribute to the herding behavior literature for a relatively new innovative-oriented stock market as well as our understanding of the investors’ circumstances, which may disprove the often-quoted disposition effect. © 2022 the author(s). published by informa uk limited, trading as taylor & francis group."
"objective: to examine professional stakeholders’ perspectives of barriers to behavioral health care (bhc) follow-up and telepsychology after pediatric traumatic brain injury (tbi). methods: twenty-nine professionals participated in a focus group (fg) or key informant interview (kii) between january and march 2020. professionals answered questions about facilitators and barriers to bhc follow-up and telepsychology. given widespread telepsychology implementation since covid-19, a follow-up survey assessing telehealth perceptions since the pandemic was sent out in december 2020. nineteen professionals completed the survey. results: professionals identified individual (e.g., family factors, insurance coverage/finances, transportation/distance, availability, planning follow-up care) and system-level (e.g., lack of access to bhc providers) barriers to bhc post-injury. possible solutions, like collaborative follow-up care, were also identified. generally, clinical professionals have favorable impressions of telepsychology and utilized services as a delivery modality for clinical care. though telepsychology could reduce barriers to care, professionals also expressed concerns (e.g., technology issues, security/safety) and challenges (e.g., funding, accessibility, training/licensure for clinicians) with implementing telepsychology. conclusion: barriers identified highlight the need for context-specific solutions to increase bhc access, with telepsychology generally recognized as a beneficial modality for bhc. future work should continue to focus on understanding barriers to bhc and potential solutions after pediatric tbi. © 2022 taylor & francis group, llc."
"much of the behavioral finance-related literature has focused on the relationship between investor sentiment and stock returns. this study applies investor sentiment to portfolio theory. many investors will choose to invest in value stocks or growth stocks according to their personal preferences or in different situations. this study aims to explore the relationship between value and growth stocks and investor sentiment, and establishes the following hypotheses about investor sentiment (1) investor sentiment in growth stocks is high relative to value stocks as the market price rises; (2) investor sentiment in value stocks is stable relative to growth stocks as the market price falls; (3) investor sentiment in previous issue growth stocks has a positive impact on current excess returns; (4) investor sentiment in previous issue value stocks has a positive impact on current excess returns. this study will take advantage of investor sentiment in behavioral finance to delve deeper into important issues in portfolio theory. © 2022, the author(s), under exclusive license to springer nature switzerland ag."
"employee stock option plans (esops) have gained prominence as a successful hr strategy that improves the employees' performance and enables the company to have an economic and strategic advantage. however, the time at which employees decide to exercise their options determines the incentive that they derive from the stock options granted to them. it is one of the crucial financial decisions which can have immense implications for both employers and employees. according to the black scholes model, an option's value is maximum when it is held until maturity. but most employees exercise their options early which comes with a cost to both the employee and the company. it can be attributed to the fact that, when faced with financial decisions, the individuals do not always refer to complex finance models and formulas and make decisions rationally, instead they resort to mental accounting and shortcuts leading to bounded rationality that can unconsciously impact their decision-making process. this paper explores the literature available on behavioral factors and biases that in addition to rational factors can affect the exercise of employee stock options. © the electrochemical society"
"in our paper, for the first time, we examine the influence of the sentiment of private investors in social networks on the trade characteristics of stocks in the russian market. monthly return rates and trading volumes are analyzed under the control of financial indicators and indicators of the quality of corporate governance of stock issuers, as well as the changing external environment in the period from 2013 to 2020. the sample for various sentiment metrics is based on unique data: messages in the telegram and mfd.ru platforms. the tonality of messages is diagnosed according to the authors’ method using artificial intelligence (neural network). the main conclusion is: the sentiment can be seen as an explanatory factor in pricing and trading activity. the influence of sentiment is non-linear. the author’s hype indicator of sentiment is proposed and compared in terms of explanatory ability of the trade characteristics with a wide range of proxy variables. the explanatory ability to identify differences is realized through regression constructions on panel data. it is shown that trade characteristics are more sensitive to the growth of negative messages, which is consistent with the postulates of behavioral finance. an increase in messages’ number of both positive and negative sentiment contributes to the growth of trading activity. an important practical conclusion is: following the crowd when the company is most intensely discussed will not result in high returns to an investor. © 2022 new economic association. all rights reserved."
"despite the success of behavioral finance, the question of whether behavioral biases persist in the face of expertise is an oft-expressed concern. it becomes pertinent to explore if investor sophistication is associated with behavioral biases, as traders gain sophistication with experience and knowledge. the current study explores this relationship by proposing a new conceptualization of investors’ sophistication via the processes of learning and competition. the study empirically explores if herding and overconfidence biases are related to learning and competition, and thus, with investors’ sophistication via these aspects. using data from equity investors from india (n = 257), the study employs anova and multiple regression analysis through indicator function to form dummy variables for different categories. the results of the study conclude that diversification is significantly related to both the biases using anova (f(3,253) = 3.081; p < 0.05) as well as multiple regression (p < 0.05). the other variables considered are found to be non-significant (p > 0.05) for both the biases. the study controls for all the other observed variables of the conceptual model to find out the effect of the change in the observed variables on the level of investor sophistication, making this study a novel and a distinct attempt. © 2022 llc cpc business perspectives. all rights reserved."

"in the financial market, because of information asymmetry, investors often ignore private information. herding behavior in financial markets has become an important research branch of behavioral finance. china stock market has implemented the shanghai-hong kong stock connect (shksc) policy and introduced mature funds, however, has it alleviated the herd effect? this article empirically verifies the existence of china's stock market before and after the implementation of the shksc policy. the research in this article found that the implementation of the shksc policy has not changed herding behavior. on the contrary, the herding effect has become more serious. it is further found that investors have no obvious investment preference for the industry to which the stock belongs. investor investment is in line with the phenomenon of ""slow rise and sharp fall.""when stock prices fall, the herd effect of the chinese stock market is also more obvious. © 2022 weili gong et al."
"behavioral finance integrates psychology in decision-making. traders commit various mistakes in stock market trading activities. the mistakes of traders can be categorized to originate from cognitive and emotional biases. the use of algorithms to identify the types of behavioral bias and its adaptability or moderation is crucial. machine learning tools help to design models that help not only in the identification of behavioral bias among traders but also help to provide timely feedback to traders. the role of machine learning techniques helps stock market traders to identify their biases in the early stages and that in turn results in the superior performance of traders. the focus of the present chapter is on the significance of machine learning techniques in the recognition and reporting of behavioral biases (cognitive) among traders. research in analytics and psychology plays a vital role to help traders improve their financial performance and avoid sub-optimal decisions. traders can leverage machine learning techniques to overcome the presence of behavioral biases in their decision-making. the use of techniques of machine learning in understanding behavioral aspects of trading activity helps to improve the efficiency of stock market traders. the present chapter draws an inference from the field of analytics, finance, and psychology. © 2022, the author(s), under exclusive license to springer nature switzerland ag."
"background and aims: personal investors decrease their stock market investment returns by trading frequently, which the behavioral finance literature has primarily explained via investors' overconfidence and low levels of financial literacy. this study investigates whether problem gambling can help account for frequent trading in a sample of active gambler/investors, as suggestive of frequent trading being in part driven by a behavioral addiction to gambling-like activities. methods: a retrospective cross-sectional study of 795 us-based participants, who reported both being active gamblers and holding stock market investments. recollected stock trading activity (typical portfolio size, purchases and sales of stocks) was compared with scores on the problem gambling severity index, a financial literacy scale, and a measure of overconfidence. results: self-reported relative stock portfolio turnover was positively associated with problem gambling scores. this association was robust to controls for financial literacy, overconfidence, and demographics, and occurred equally among investors of all self-reported portfolio sizes. discussion and conclusions: this study provides support for the hypothesis that behavioral addiction to gambling-like activities is associated with frequent stock market trading. new investment products that increase the ease of trading may therefore be detrimental to some investors. © 2021 the author(s)."

"background: the life-history theory is a well-established framework that predicts behaviors and explains how and why organisms allocate effort and resources to different life goals. delay discounting (dd) is associated with risky behaviors and has been suggested as a candidate behavioral marker of addiction. thus, we investigated the relationship between dd, life-history strategies, and engagement in risky behaviors among individuals in recovery from alcohol use disorder (aud). methods: data from 110 individuals in recovery from addiction from the international quit & recovery registry, an ongoing online registry designed to understand recovery phenotype, were included in the analysis. the association between life-history strategies, dd, engagement in risky behaviors, and remission status were assessed. results: life-history strategy scores were significantly associated with dd rates and finance, health, and personal development behaviors after controlling for age, sex, race, ethnicity, years of education, marital status, smoking status, and history of other substance use. remission status was significantly associated with life-history strategy, dd, drug use, fitness, health, and safe driving after controlling for age, sex, race, years of education, marital status, and smoking status. in addition, a mediation analysis using hayes’ methods revealed that the discounting rates partially mediated the association between remission status and life-history strategy scores. conclusions: life-history strategies and remission status are both significantly associated with dd and various health and finance behaviors among individuals in recovery from aud. this finding supports the characterizations of dd as a candidate behavioral marker of addiction that could help differentiate subgroups needing special attention or specific interventions to improve the outcomes of their recovery. future longitudinal studies are warranted to understand the relationships between changes in life-history strategies, dd, maladaptive health behaviors, and remission status over time. © 2022 by the research society on alcoholism"

"during the past two decades the development of information communication technologies has largely changed our sociotechnical systems. the proliferation of internet technologies especially significantly resulted in the information explosion. on the one hand people benefited from the explosive growth of information on the other hand individuals who suffered from the information flooding encountered many challenges in assessing information credibility. researchers in the information-related field ifield e. g. library and information science communication computer science and human-computer interaction have contributed to tons of literature to understand credibility and its relationship among people information technologies and society. this paper aims to comprehensively review the credibility literature in the ifield. first we reviewed the conceptual development of credibility research in terms of conceptualizations theories and methodologies. regarding conceptualization we summarized four kinds of approaches of conceptualizing credibility 1 conceptualizing credibility as a multidimensional or multifaced concept 2 conceptualizing credibility from the different causes 3 conceptualizing credibility on abstract information objects 4 conceptualizing credibility on concrete information or technology objects. in terms of theoretical development the review suggested that the theories adopted in prior credibility studies came from multiple disciplinary veins. second we reviewed how the changes of external technology landscapes drove the conceptual development of credibility research. we found that in the early stage of web era credibility research was expanding its scope from studying traditional mass media to digital media. with the advent of web 2. 0 user-generated content ugc has become an important issue for credibility research. moreover social media imposed great social influence on people’s information behaviors and created powerful means of mis- and disinformation distribution which raised notable credibility-related concerns. additionally the emerging technology of artificial intelligence ai allows machines to generate and distribute information and created new issues for credibility research. centered on the review we identified the key components and carefully sketched the picture about topic evolution in credibility research. third based on the review we proposed several future directions from the conceptual methodological and topic perspectives respectively. conceptually future research could refine the concept of credibility to cope with the changes in sociotechnical systems and develop the measurement scales of credibility concept. methodologically we call for more longitudinal studies and further efforts of applying interdisciplinary methods or tools to uncover the cognitive affective behavioral mechanisms of human credibility assessment. finally we proposed several topics for future research to consider namely the credibility issues in digital health cyberspace governance e-commerce and internet finance. 1 fig. 3 tabs. 100 refs. © 2022, editorial office of journal of library science in china. all rights reserved."
"executive summary personal interpretation is a key management tool to help visitors discover, value, and enjoy parks. goals and objectives for personal interpretation should be con-sistent among staff to ensure that planning and delivery are effective in achieving targeted outcomes. the aim of this study was to assess how the outcome priorities for, and resources used by, front-line interpreters (employees who deliver personal interpretation programs) changed over the course of one season. staff goals are also influenced by agency goals and agency support. we were interested in how park agency legislation and management goals were aligned with front-line staff goals and how the agency supported (or did not support) staff in achieving those outcomes. front-line interpreters from alberta parks completed in-person ques-tionnaires during may 2018 (time 1), describing their priorities for interpretive outcomes, perceived trends, resources used, opportunities, barriers, and demo-graphics. following the delivery of personal interpretation in 11 provincial parks across alberta during the may to september 2018 park visitation season, the same interpreters completed a follow-up survey between october 2018 and january 2019 (time 2) to understand if and why those responses changed. respondents were asked to rate their priorities for six main outcomes of personal interpretation. the top outcomes at time 1 were visitor enjoyment, connections to place, and learning. at time 2, learning and enjoyment priorities declined; attitudes, behavioral change, connections to place, and positive memories did not change as desired outcomes. when asked which of the six outcomes were most important, respondents indicated connections to place, positive memories, and enjoyment most often (but there were no changes from time 1 to time 2). as for resources used in guiding content and strategic decisions in delivering personal interpretation programs, the importance of park legislation and park finances de-clined; the importance of the other resources did not change. when asked what organizational factors helped them be successful (or unsuccessful), staff relied overwhelmingly on their immediate team, including their supervisors and fellow interpreters. however, responses from time 2 suggested that respondents felt in need of more training, more time to prepare new and innovative programs, and more support from upper-level managers and their agency. this research can help inform park practitioner efforts to understand how interpretive priorities change over time and what resources are important for in-terpreters. park agency managers can use these results to hire, train, and nurture front-line interpreters, with a goal of improving the impact of personal interpretation programs. © 2021 sagamore-venture publishing."
"we examine the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the livelihoods of the poor in a semi-rural setting in bangladesh. we use an unusually rich dataset which tracks the economic and financial transactions of sixty poor and very poor individuals and their families on a daily real-time basis for 12 months, from 1 october 2019 to 30 september 2020. these households for the past five years have volunteered as respondents in a ‘financial diaries’ study known as the ‘hrishipara daily diaries project’. we use a mixed methods approach, combining qualitative case studies of five diarists with a quantitative analysis of the daily data extracted from the diaries. we document the behavioral responses to covid-19 by individual diarists, which shows the varied experiences of the poor during the pandemic. further, we find that the pandemic had significant negative effects on the livelihoods of the poor in our study, with financial inflows and outflows, incomes and household expenditures much below pre-pandemic levels in the pandemic period. government lockdowns in april and may 2020 led to a sharp decline in incomes and household expenditures. while incomes and expenditures recovered in the post-lockdown period, they remained below pre-pandemic levels. financial transactions such as borrowing, saving withdrawals and exchange of monetary gifts came to a standstill in the lockdown period, making it difficult for households to use conventional coping mechanisms in the face of a large unanticipated decline in incomes. exploring the coping mechanisms that households used to adjust to the declines in incomes and their lack of access to formal and informal sources of finance, we find that households drew down on their cash reserves at home as well as cutting down on non-food expenditures to protect their spending on food. © 2021 the authors"

"sustainable finance is a rich field of research. yet, existing reviews remain limited due to the piecemeal insights offered through a sub-set rather than the entire corpus of sustainable finance. to address this gap, this study aims to conduct a large-scale review that would provide a state-of-the-art overview of the performance and intellectual structure of sustainable finance. to do so, this study engages in a review of sustainable finance research using big data analytics through machine learning of scholarly research. in doing so, this study unpacks the most influential articles and top contributing journals, authors, institutions, and countries, as well as the methodological choices and research contexts for sustainable finance research. in addition, this study reveals insights into seven major themes of sustainable finance research, namely socially responsible investing, climate financing, green financing, impact investing, carbon financing, energy financing, and governance of sustainable financing and investing. to drive the field forward, this study proposes several suggestions for future sustainable finance research, which include developing and diffusing innovative sustainable financing instruments, magnifying and managing the profitability and returns of sustainable financing, making sustainable finance more sustainable, devising and unifying policies and frameworks for sustainable finance, tackling greenwashing of corporate sustainability reporting in sustainable finance, shining behavioral finance on sustainable finance, and leveraging the power of new-age technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, internet of things, and machine learning for sustainable finance. © 2021, the author(s), under exclusive licence to springer science+business media, llc, part of springer nature."
"the purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate the factors that affect malaysian users’ financing to participate in using equity-based financing (musharakah 8l mudharabati) or known as ebf. this study applied the theory of planned behavior (tpb) as the underlying theory to analyze the determinants that influence the intention of malaysian users’ of financing to participate in ebf. the analysis was conducted using structural equation modelling (sem), with a total of 250 respondents. according to the findings, only attitudes (att) about equity-based financing (ebf) had a positive and significant impact on malaysian users of financing involvement in ebf during pandemic covid-19. subjective norms (snorms) and perceived behavioral control (pbcontrol) turn out to be non-significant factors for users of financing in malaysia. the results of the study could lead to advancements towards islamic banking and finance, as well as positive implications for practitioners. focusing on att to establish customer-oriented products of financing connections within banks could help ebf applications be better managed. this study applied tpb for the first time to malaysian users ’ financial decisions in the area of ebf during the pandemic covid-19. © 2022. global journal al-thaqafah. all rights reserved."
"the purpose of this chapter is to introduce how the conceptualization and study of time correspond to the development of personal finance as an interdisciplinary profession. this chapter describes time in the context of one of four dimensions: (a) time horizon, (b) decision frame, (c) orientation/preference, and (d) perception/ perspective. as noted in this chapter, the concept of time is an un-unified concept. researchers, policymakers, and personal finance practitioners interested in applied financial decision making often focus on goal time horizons. those interested in decision- maker behavioral tendencies generally limit their inquiries to describing decision time frames or modeling time orientation and time preference. researchers who are interested in the nonconscious processes underlying human behavior typically focus on evaluating time perceptions and perspectives. to date, these disparate research agendas have not been unified in any meaningful way. this includes, for example, the lack of unified time horizon definitions. this chapter reintroduces the notion that a time horizon definition can be identified and standardized. this chapter concludes with an insight that the future of personal finance will be closely aligned with time horizon, decision time frame, orientation/preference, and perception/perspective research developments that occur over the next few decades. © 2022 walter de gruyter gmbh, berlin/boston."

"in this article, we explain main concepts of prospect theory and cumulative prospect theory within the rational dynamic asset pricing framework. we derive option pricing formulas when asset returns are altered by a generalized prospect theory value function or a modified prelec's weighting probability function. we introduce new parametric classes for prospect theory value functions and probability weighting functions consistent with rational dynamic pricing theory. after studying the behavioral finance notion of ""greed and fear""from the perspective of rational dynamic asset pricing theory, we derive the corresponding option pricing formulas when asset returns follow continuous diffusions or discrete binomial trees. we define a mixed subordinated variance gamma process to model asset return and derive the corresponding option pricing formula. finally, we apply the proposed probability weighting functions to study the greedy or fearful disposition of option traders when asset returns follow a mixed subordinated variance gamma process. the results indicate availability bias and diminishing sensitivity of option traders.  copyright 2021 with intelligence ltd."
"according to behavioral finance, the effect of attention in the stock market has a significant impact on investor decision-making. individual stocks of high investor attention increase investor irrational bias, such as overconfidence, and this psychological biaswww.earticle.net causes an overreaction to the asset. overconfidence investors make aggressive transactions, and investor attention causes high trading volume. this study investigates the impact of investor overconfidence on stock returns in the korean stock market based on the fact that investor confidence due to the effect of investor attention is closely related to trading volume. we present variables that can measure the degree of investor overconfidence in individual assets and analyze the effect of investor overconfidence on stock returns in the korean securities market. in this study, we present the investor's overconfidence measure (ioc) using the highest trading volume over the past 12 months and the current trading volume. at the end of each month, we form a portfolio of deciles based on ioc to confirm the relationship between stock returns and investors' overconfidence. we focus on extreme portfolios to determine the impact of ioc on future returns. if the investor's overconfidence has a significant negative effect on the stock return, the investor's overconfidence has a relatively low stock return on an extremely high portfolio. as a result, the higher the investor's confidence, the lower the future return. it argued that the relationship between investor overconfidence and stock returns through a zero-cost portfolio strategy in which longs the lowest ioc portfolio and shorts the highest ioc portfolio, the ioc strategy has a significant positive return. this phenomenon is maintained even after considering firm characteristics factors, investor overreaction, volatility, and gambling tendency. the ioc's significant negative predictive power for stock returns is maintained through fama-macbeth cross-sectional regression analysis. furthermore, we reaffirm the results of this study by the proportion of individual investors' trading, the separation of sub-periods, and the past period constituting the ioc. as a result of dividing the portfolio according to the proportion of individual investors, the higher the proportion of individual investors, the more pronounced the significant negative relationship between stock returns and investors' overconfidence. moreover, the results of the kosdaq market where individual investors have a high proportion of transactions and high volatility has a higher return on ioc strategy. the sample period is divided into four sub-periods and analyzed. we confirm that the relationship between investor overconfidence and stock returns is relatively weakened after the financial crisis. in addition, the return on the ioc strategy increases as individual investors' market participation increases after the outbreak of coronavirus in the korean stock market. these results reaffirm that the ioc fully reflects the psychological changes of individual investors. finally, as a result of changing the past period constituting the ioc to 6, 18, and 24 months, the ioc strategy has a significant positive rate of return in all past periods. accordingly, investors' overconfidence in individual assets in the domestic stock market has a significant negative effect on the stock returns and a significant cross-sectional negative predictive power. this study is meaningful in that it studied the effect of investor overconfidence on the stock market due to the effect of interest in individual assets in the domestic stock market. furthermore, it has implications for related fields in that it presents measures indicating the degree of investor overconfidence in individual assets and presents empirical results. and report the results of controlling several variables closely related to investor overconfidence. these results supportwww.earticle.net the existing argument that investors' overconfidence has a significant effect on stock returns. © 2021, korean finance association. all rights reserved."
"competition and consumer search costs can lead to price dispersion in an oligopoly. io research has long identified the existence of search costs and estimated their distribution and is now beginning to study which consumers sit where in the distribution. this paper argues for a view of consumer protection and competition policy that considers distributional outcomes along with efficiency. we discuss the evidence on how consumer search varies over the income distribution and provide a literature review that summarizes research on (i) the search-income gradient; (ii) mechanisms for the gradient; and (iii) how search-based price discrimination can give rise to regressive price dispersion. through our review, we collect evidence from a wide range of industries that shows that low-income consumers tend not to search. we then draw on research from io, marketing, finance, urban, and behavioral economics for explanations as to why this pattern persists. finally, we conclude that io researchers have much to offer in identifying and quantifying the distributional impacts of market power, thereby contributing to current academic and policy debates on efficiency-equity trade-offs in policy design. © 2021 elsevier b.v."

"governments settle their financial obligations and pay for the public expenditures largely through finances generated from taxes. for many developing countries like pakistan, the state authorities are still having difficulty to achieve tax compliance. existing literature has yet to traverse individual's tax compliance behavior on developing countries. the current study, however, explores the relationships among voluntary tax compliance behavior of individual taxpayers with selected economic, social, behavioral and institutional factors. this individual tax compliance behavior is studied through the multi-perspective lenses of the theory of attribution, equity theory, expected utility theory, and social exchange theory. quantitative design using the survey method was employed to collect data from 435 individual taxpayers through questionnaire. for testing linkage between constructs, through mediation and moderation tests, structural equation modeling technique was used. the results suggest that tax compliance simplicity has a larger impact on tax filing than perception about government spending and tax morale. furthermore, perception of fairness significantly mediates the strengths between morale, simplicity, government spending and compliance behavior. © 2021, the author(s)."

"purpose: this study integrates self-determination theory (sdt) and the technology acceptance model (tam) to explore how gamification increases users' motivation and intention to use personal financial management (pfm) apps, and how it facilitates their adoption. design/methodology/approach: data from 208 users of the mint app were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. findings: the results showed that gamifying pfm apps satisfies users' needs for competence and autonomy and enhances their autonomous motivation to use them. users' motivation increases their perceptions of ease of use and usefulness of the apps and causes them to develop more favorable attitudes toward them. the findings also confirmed a relationship between users' attitudes toward pfm apps and the behavioral intention to use them. research limitations/implications: to investigate the generalizability of results, studies using other pfm apps would be useful. the cross-sectional nature of the research also limits its causal inference. practical implications: this research provides support for the use of gamification in pfm apps and offers suggestions that may help fintech companies and banks to persuade users to engage with their apps. originality/value: although gamification is a trending topic, few studies have explored its use in the finance industry. drawing on sdt and the tam, this study extends previous research and adds new insights into the effects of gamification in this context. © 2021, emerald publishing limited."
"behavioral finance theory holds that the change of credit market sentiment is an important cause of macroeconomic fluctuations. in this paper, high yield corporate bonds issuance share and bond credit spreads are used to agent credit market sentiment to analyse the impact of credit market sentiment on the fluctuations of macroeconomic. the empirical study shows that the increase in credit spreads on corporate bonds with one-year lag can predict the decline in gross domestic product (gdp), industrial value-added (iva) growth, and the increase in corporate leverage level. results remain robust with different time span and regression variables. besides, the study also shows that issued share of high yield bond is a good agent variable for market sentiment. the var model confirms the previous relationship and confirms the conclusion that the spread shock will cause the main observed value of the real economy to go down. the credit spread index and high-yield bond issuance share index constructed in this paper can provide some support for macroeconomic warning and analysis and provide some reference for economic policy makers and investors. © 2021, editorial board of journal of systems engineering society of china. all right reserved."
"individuals are expected to be rational and follow the approach prescribed under different traditional finance theories while constructing portfolios. in reality, studies from different parts of the world show that individuals do not act rationally due to cognitive limitations and influence of emotions and feelings. additionally, in quite a few countries, religion plays an important role in decision-making. as a result, individuals make suboptimal decisions, like holding poorly diversified portfolios, excessive or minimal trading, and taking excessive or too little risk with their portfolios. the analysis of impact of behavioral biases and religiosity has not been done in the context of individual investors living in uae, which this paper addresses. a survey questionnaire was administered to arab nationals living in uae. data of 129 individuals were analyzed. the findings showed that these investors were influenced by emotional and cognitive biases, had good knowledge of religiosity, & placed them as important. this behavior is consistent with investor behavior observed in the rest of the world. subsequent to these empirical findings, the paper has developed a quantitative model to predict the impact of behavioral biases and religiosity on asset allocation decisions. the research approach used for developing the quantitative model can be replicated by researchers from across the world tailored to their own regions. © 2021, the author(s)."
"purpose: cancer screening uptake differs between groups in ways that cannot be explained by socioeconomic status alone. this study examined associations between material, psychosocial, and behavioral aspects of financial hardship and cancer screening behaviors. methods: surveys were mailed to 7,979 people ages 18–75 who were seen in the statewide health system in indiana. participants reported ses, feelings about finances, and whether they had to forgo medical care due to cost. this was compared to uptake of mammogram, colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy, and pap testing in best-fit multivariable logistic regression analyses controlling for demographic and healthcare characteristics. results: a total of 970 surveys were returned; the majority of respondents were female (54%), non-hispanic white (75%), and over 50 years old (76%). 15% reported forgoing medical care due to cost; this barrier was higher among black than white participants (24% vs. 13%; p = 0.001). in a best fit regression model for colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy, those who reported they had to forgo medical care due to cost had lower odds of screening (aor 0.41; 95% ci 0.22–0.74). forgoing medical care due to cost was not significantly associated with pap testing in bivariate analyses. for mammogram, forgoing medical care due to cost was significant in bivariate analyses (or 0.44; 95% ci 0.22–0.88), but was not significant in the multivariable model. conclusion: associations between financial hardship and cancer screening suggest the need to reduce barriers to cancer screening even among patients who have access to healthcare. future research should explore barriers related to both healthcare and personal costs. © 2021, the author(s), under exclusive licence to springer nature switzerland ag."

"the rational investor behavior and news triggered price change assumed by the efficient market hypothesis (emh) could not explain most of asset price variances, suggesting the need for an alternative theory. the behavioral finance theory (bft) advocates those economic judgments and decisions in markets are often irrational because of systematic and predictable psychological bias. however, due to the lack of measurable investment behaviors, proponents of the efficient market hypothesis argue that irrational behavior could not be reliably identified and predicted. here we show that the price-takers behavior gauged by the normalized excess demand (ned) can be measured and the results explain most of the variances of sp500 daily returns over eight years of available data, the remaining variances are due to price-makers behavior, an influence abstracted out by the walrasian general equilibrium theory. the interactions between behaviors of price-takers and price-makers drive market price fluctuations. for short-term prediction, we demonstrate that detected market makers' inventory positions often lead to intraday and daily market reversals. for long-term forecasting, feedback analyses of ned and sp500 data reveal signals of looming plunges and recovery processes in 2000, 2008, and 2020 market crises. © 2021 the authors"
"this book is the second edition of behavioral decision theory, published in 2014. the main approach and structure of this book have been retained in the new edition. however, this second edition provides a fresh overview of the idea of behavioral decision theory and related research findings such as theoretical and empirical discoveries of preference formation, time discounting, social interaction, and social decision making. the book covers a wide range from classical to relatively recent major studies concerning behavioral decision theory, which, in brief, is a general term for descriptive theories to explain the psychological knowledge related to people's decision-making behavior. it is called a theory but is actually a combination of various psychological theories, for which no axiomatic systems-such as those associated with the utility theory widely used in economics-have been established. the utility theory is often limited to qualitative knowledge; however, as the studies of nobel laureates h. a. simon, d. kahneman, and r. thaler have suggested, the psychological methodology and knowledge of behavioral decision theory have been applied widely in such fields as economics, business administration, and engineering and are expected to become even more useful in the future. research into people's decision making represents an important part in those fields, various aspects of which overlap with the scope of behavioral decision theory. this theory is closely related to behavioral economics and behavioral finance, which have come into greater use in recent years. this book will appeal especially to graduate students, advanced undergraduate students, and researchers who are interested in decision-making phenomena. © the editor(s) (if applicable) and the author(s), under exclusive license to springer nature singapore pte ltd. 2021. all rights reserved."
"this study investigates the relationship between digital financial inclusion, external financing, and the innovation performance of high-tech enterprises in china. the choice of corporate financing methods is an important part of organizational behavioral psychology, and different financing models will have a certain effect on organizational performance, especially in the digital economy environment. therefore, based on resource dependence theory and financing constraint theory, the present study utilizes the panel data collected from the china stock market & accounting research (csmar) database from 2011 to 2020 of 112 companies in the yangtze river delta region and the “the peking university digital financial inclusion index of china (pku-dfiic)” released by the peking university digital finance research center and ant financial group. the results show that the digital financial inclusion index (dfiic) has a significant positive correlation with the innovation performance of high-tech enterprises. the higher the level of debt financing, the stronger the role of digital financial inclusion in promoting innovation performance. investigating the dfiic in terms of coverage breadth and usage depth, we find that usage depth does not significantly encourage innovation performance. the effect of the interaction between coverage breadth and external financing is consistent with the results for the dfiic. the study suggests that equity financing promotes the usage depth of the dfiic in state-owned enterprises. in contrast, debt financing promotes the coverage breadth of non-state-owned enterprises. finally, we propose relevant policy recommendations based on the research results. it includes in-depth popularization of inclusive finance in the daily operations of enterprises at the technical level, refinement of external financing policy incentives for enterprises based on the characteristics of ownership, and strengthening the research of technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence (ai), and cloud computing. the paper presents a range of theoretical and practical implications for practitioners and academics relevant to high-tech enterprises. copyright © 2021 han and gu."
"this paper examines how share pledge transactions signal changes in investor sentiment. based on the investor sentiment model proposed by gervais and odean (2001), we develop an investor sentiment model by incorporating the impact of share pledge transactions on stock prices by linking the signal transmission of the share pledges with investor decision making. using data from the china stock market from 2014 to 2018, we find that share pledge transactions can lead to emotional bias and consequently affect investment decisions. specifically, stock market volatility increases with changes in both optimistic and pessimistic investor sentiment bias regarding share pledge transactions. from the perspective of behavioral finance, with the vector autoregression (var) model and the impulse response test, we study the relationship between investor sentiment indicators, including share pledge factors and stock market volatility. among the investor sentiment indicator components, we find that the composition weights of the share pledge volume and the share pledge ratio are 22.54 %, and 21.49 % respectively. share pledge transactions have an obvious impact on investor sentiment. the paper also shows that share pledge transactions have an accelerating effect on stock price cyclical fluctuations through the investor sentiment effect. during a stock index crash, such transactions may constitute a potential market factor of instability. © 2021 board of trustees of the university of illinois"
"the development of behavioral finance theory and the internet provides the possibility to analyze the impact of events on financial markets from the perspective of investor attention. to this end, this paper analyzes the impact of events on the metal futures market based on google trends perspectives using mixed frequency analysis and multifractal methods. overall, the impact of events can be effectively reflected by investor attention in the metal futures market. different metals react differently to events. precious metals are safe havens during financial crises, while industrial metals are not. earthquakes that occur in countries with large metal supply and demand sensitivities have a more significant impact on metal futures. as the international situation changes, the impact of pirating events on metal futures appears more significant after 2010. if necessary, powerful controls on industrial metals may be needed when events such as earthquakes and piracy occur. when events such as financial crises occur, strong policy measures may be needed to restore balance from the perspective of precious metals. © 2021 elsevier ltd"

"background. inequities in health care exist in the philippines due to various modifiable and non-modifiable determinants. through the years, different interventions were undertaken by the government and various stakeholders to address these inequities in primary care. however, inequities still continue to persist. the enactment of the universal health care (uhc) act aims to ensure that every filipino will have equitable access to comprehensive and quality health care services by strengthening primary care. as a step towards uhc, the government endeavors to guarantee equity by prioritizing assistance and support to underserved areas in the country. this paper aims to review different interventions to promote equity in the underserved areas that could aid in needs assessment. methods. a search through pubmed and google scholar was conducted using the keywords, “inequity,” “primary care” and “philippines.” the search yielded more than 10,000 articles which were further filtered to publication date, relevance to the topic, and credibility of source. a total of 58 full-text records were included in the review. results and discussion. in the philippines, inequities in primary care exist in the context of health programs, facilities, human health resources, finances, and training. these were recognized by various stakeholders, from government and private sector, and nongovernment organizations, taking actions to address inequities, applying different strategies and approaches but with a shared goal of improving primary care. on another end, social accountability must also be instilled among filipinos to address identified social and behavioral barriers in seeking primary care. with political commitment, improvement in primary care towards health equity can be achieved. conclusion and recommendation. to address inequities in primary care, there is a need to ensure adequate human resources for health, facilities, supplies such as medications, vaccination, clean water, and sources of funds. moreover, regular conduct of training on healthcare services and delivery are needed. these will capacitate health workers and government leaders with continuous advancement in knowledge and skills, to be effective providers of primary care. institutionalizing advocacy in equity through policies in healthcare provision would help realize the aims of the universal health care act. © 2020 university of the philippines manila. all rights reserved."
"this article is the first one that considers a model of the choice between the different types of crowdfunding, which contains elements of the asymmetric information approach and behavioral finance (overconfident entrepreneurs). the model provides several implications, most of which have not yet been tested. our model predicts that equity-based crowdfunding is more profitable than reward-based crowdfunding when an entrepreneur is overconfident. this is because the entrepreneur learns from the sale of shares before making production decisions. the model also predicts that an equilibrium can exist where some firms use equity-based crowdfunding, which contrasts the results of traditional theories (which have rational managers), for example, the pecking-order theory. it also contrasts traditional behavioral finance literature (e. g. fairchild, r. 2005.

"this paper reexamines the issue of behavioral heterogeneity in the stock market. in contrast to previously documented contemporaneous results, we test the issue by identifying and testing four new determinants of the proportion of fundamentalists and chartists in the stock market. our empirical results are consistent with the following notions. first, the proportion of fundamentalists increases for stocks with incremental information involved in accounting reporting as proxied by discretionary accruals. second, the proportion of fundamentalists is positively related to the degree of dispersion in financial analysts' forecasts, which implies that stock investors care more about the intrinsic value of firms obtained with fundamental analysis when encountering information asymmetry or uncertainty. third, the proportion of fundamentalists increases for stocks with higher volatility in prices. for the proportion of chartists, the reverse of these arguments holds true. fourth, the proportion of chartists versus fundamentalists is related to the investment horizon. investors give more weights to technical analysis when considering short-term investments. for long-term investments, investors increase the weighting given to the fundamental analysis. © 2020 the institute of behavioral finance."
"purpose: this study aims to explain the facts about behavioral biases that cannot be explained by rational patterns in ship investments of small-size shipping companies. design/methodology/approach: a qualitative approach was adopted in this study. the systematic approach of wolcott (1994) and the action flows proposed by miles and huberman (1994) were taken into consideration. findings: factors affecting ship investments are classified as ship finance, market timing, ship specifications and profile and business models of ship investors. in addition, behavioral biases that stand out under each theme are explained in the light of behavioral finance literature. originality/value: the originality of this study rests on the lack of studies on behavioral aspects of ship investments. © 2021, pacific star group education foundation."
"when seeing algorithms err, we trust them less and decrease using them compared to after seeing humans err; this is called algorithm aversion. this paper builds on the algorithm aversion literature and the third-party reactions to mistreatment model to investigate a wider array of reactions to erring algorithms. using an experimental design deployed with a vignette-based online study, we investigate gut reactions, justice cognitions, and behavioral intentions toward erring algorithms (compared to erring humans). our results show that when the error was committed by an algorithm (vs. a human), gut reactions were harsher (i.e., less acceptance and more negative feelings), justice cognitions weaker (i.e., less blame, less forgiveness, and less accountability), and behavioral intentions stronger. these results remain independent of factors such as the maturity of the algorithms (better than or same as human performance), the severity of the error (high or low), and the domain of use (recruitment or finance). we discuss how these results complement the current literature thanks to a robust and more nuanced pattern of reactions to erring algorithms. © 2021 the authors"
"background: as a response to many years of repetitive budget deficits, region dalarna in sweden started a restructuring process in 2015, and implemented a decommissioning programme to achieve a balanced budget until 2019. leading politicians and public servants took the overall decisions about the decommissioning programme, but the clinical decision-making and implementation was largely run by the clinic managers and their staff. as the decommissioning programme improved the finances, met relatively little resistance from the clinical departments, and neither patient safety nor quality of care were perceived to be negatively affected, the initial implementation could be considered successful. the aim of this study was to investigate clinic managers’ experience of important factors enabling the successful implementation of a decommissioning programme in a local healthcare organization. methods: drawing on a framework of factors and processes that shape successful implementation of decommissioning decisions, this study highlights the most important factors that enabled the clinic managers to successfully implement the decommissioning programme. during 2018, an interview study was conducted with 26 clinic managers, strategically selected to represent psychiatry, primary care, surgery and medicine. a deductive content analysis was used to analyze the interviews. by applying a framework to the data, the most important factors were illuminated. results: the findings highlighted factors and processes crucial to implementing the decommissioning programme: 1) create a story to get a shared image of the rationale for change, 2) secure an executive leadership team represented by clinical champions, 3) involve clinic managers at an early stage to ensure a fair decision-making process, 4) base the decommissioning decisions on evidence, without compromising quality and patient safety, 5) prepare the organisation to handle a process characterised by tensions and strong emotions, 6) communicate demonstrable benefits, 7) pay attention to the need of cultural and behavioral change and 8) transparently evaluate the outcome of the process. conclusions: from these findings, we conclude that in order to successfully implement a decommissioning programme, clinic managers and healthcare professions must be given and take responsibility, for both the process and outcome. © 2021, the author(s)."

"we estimate a heterogeneous agent model on five prominent equity investment styles—value, size, profitability, investment, and momentum—and find evidence for behavioral heterogeneity in expected return formation. our model features two groups of boundedly rational investors, fundamentalists and chartists, whose demand functions for the investment styles depend on their respective expected style return forecasts. the fundamentalists form return expectations using a model based on time-varying stock-level characteristics and dynamic factor premia, and the chartists do so based on heuristics commonly employed by technical analysts, such as moving average rules. our results cast doubt on the theories that assume perfect rationality of the representative agent in financial markets, and give support to the behavioral theories with heterogeneous agents. © 2020 the authors. international review of finance published by john wiley & sons australia, ltd on behalf of international review of finance ltd. 2020"
"background: behavioral and psychological symptoms of distress in dementia (bpsd) are major drivers of poor quality of life, caregiver burden, institutionalization, and cost of care in nursing homes. the evidence integration triangle (eit)-4-bpsd in nursing homes was a pragmatic hybrid iii trial of an implementation strategy to help staff use evidence-based non-pharmacological interventions to prevent and manage bpsd. this study aimed to describe and explore the stakeholders’ perceptions of the process to implement the eit-4-bpsd strategy including its utility, and the barriers and facilitators to implementation in real-world settings. methods: eit-4-bpsd was a multi-layer implementation strategy that engaged nursing home stakeholder groups to define community specific goals towards reducing bpsd over a 12-month period. stakeholder groups from nursing homes that completed all 12-months of the implementation strategy were invited to participate in this process evaluation study. qualitative data from focus group transcripts were analyzed using a conventional content analysis. emerging codes were sorted into categories, then organized in meaningful clusters based on the domains of the re-aim (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework. results: the eit-4-bpsd implementation strategy was completed in 21 nursing homes; 93 stakeholders participated in focus groups. over half of participating nursing homes reported meeting their bpsd goals as expected or more. challenges, facilitators, and contextual factors reported by stakeholder members explains variability in the implementation of eit-4-bpsd strategy in 11 key categories: family; staff; organizational; staff, environmental, and resident outcomes; utility of eit resources; adoption barriers and facilitators; care process adaptations; and future planning. conclusion: stakeholders offered guidance on salient factors influencing the feasibility and utility of eit-4-bpsd adoption and implementation to consider in future implementation research that aims to improve behavioral well-being in nh residents living with dementia. engagement of family and staff at all levels of the organization (management, leadership, and direct care); and measurement of staff, environmental, and resident outcomes were perceived as critical for future implementation success. while regulations, finances, and competing demands on staff time were perceived as reducing implementation success. trial registration: the testing the implementation of eit-4-bpsd study was registered in the clinicaltrials.gov (nct03014570) january 9, 2017. © 2021, the author(s)."
"media-aware stock movements are well acknowledged by the behavioral finance. as the soul of a firm, ceo's media behavior is critical to the operation of a firm. ceo's exposure could have captured the investors' attention and enhanced the media effect in the stock market in terms of the ""eyeball economics"", or ceo's overexposure could have attracted more attention than firm-specific news, which attenuate the media effect in the stock market due to the investors' limited attention. this study systematically explores the role and the moderating effect of ceo's media behavior on the relationship between media content and stock markets. using daily frequency data for a sample of chinese stocks, this study shows that higher ceo media exposure attenuates the media effect on stock markets, especially consumer-related stocks. © 2021."

"purpose: although phone calls are widely used by debt collection services to persuade delinquent customers to repay, few financial services studies have analyzed the unstructured voice and text data to investigate how debt collection call strategies drive customers to repay. moreover, extant research opens the “black box” mainly through psychological theories without hard behavioral data of customers. the purpose of our study is to address this research gap. design/methodology/approach: the authors randomly sampled 3,204 debt collection calls from a large consumer finance company in east asia. to rule out alternative explanations for the findings, such as consumers' previous experience of being persuaded by debt collectors or repeated calls, the authors selected calls made to delinquent customers who had not been delinquent before and were being called by the company for the first time. the authors transformed the unstructured voice and textual data into structured data through automatic speech recognition (asr), voice mining, natural language processing (nlp) and machine learning analyses. findings: the findings revealed that (1) both moral appeal (carrot) and social warning (stick) strategies decrease repayment time because they arouse mainly happy emotion and fear emotion, respectively; (2) the legal warning (stick) strategy backfires because of decreasing the happy emotion and triggering the anger emotion, which impedes customers' compliance; and (3) in contrast to traditional wisdom, the combination of carrot and stick fails to decrease the repayment time. originality/value: the findings provide a valuable and systematic understanding of the effect of carrot strategies, stick strategies and the combinations of them on repayment time. this study is among the first to empirically analyze the effectiveness of carrot strategies, stick strategies and their joint strategies on repayment time through unstructured vocal and textual data analysis. what's more, the previous studies open the “black box” through psychological mechanism. the authors firstly elucidate a behavioral mechanism for why consumers behave differently under varying debt collection strategies by utilizing asr, nlp and vocal emotion analyses. © 2021, emerald publishing limited."

"the republic of korea faces a rapidly aging population that is more reliant on public pension support but pension contributions are insufficient to support its long-term obligations. as a result, there is a growing debate on what type of reforms to the current defined-pension system could balance the long-term funding of the system with insuring benefit levels for old and new beneficiaries. in this paper, we develop and estimate a dynamic behavioral model that captures essential elements of the national pension scheme (nps) and behavioral responses in labor supply, savings and benefit claiming to changes in the public pension system using a nationally-representative sample of married couples nearing retirement from the korean longitudinal study of aging (klosa). we use the model estimates to evaluate the effect of counterfactual policy experiments such as increases in the contribution rate and the extension of normal retirement age on the decision to work or not work, savings and benefit claiming among individuals near retirement. while these policies are aimed at shoring up the nps, our model demonstrates that changes to the contribution rate could discourage work and savings in married households near retirement. in particular, a 2 percentage point immediate increase in the contribution rate would reduce household savings by 2 percent among poor households, as well as reduce labor participation among wives by 3 percent and among husbands by less than a percent. when we simulate the same increase in the contribution rate in even increments over five years, households anticipate the policy change and increase their savings to compensate for the future fall in income, dissipating undesirable behavioral responses such as decreased work and savings. in contrast, an increase of 2 years in the normal retirement age leads to a 3 percent increase in household savings, and to an increase in both husband and wife labor force participation (less than 1 percent and 3 percent respectively). these finding suggest policy design, such as phase-in periods, can be leveraged to minimize undesirable behavioral responses of households near retirement. despite their potential detrimental effects in labor supply and savings, findings from a benefit-cost analysis suggest that the costs of undesired behavioral responses to an increase in contribution rates are orders of magnitude smaller than the revenue benefits to the nps's finances. © 2021 elsevier b.v."

"we propose an aggregate measure of employee sentiment based on millions of employee online reviews and we test whether big employee data embedded in expert financial models can improve stock return predictability. in line with behavioral finance theory, our results document that the collective employee sentiment is a strong predictor of stock market returns with lower future returns following high employee sentiment. this predictive power is more pronounced when the employee sentiment index is constructed using the expectations of employees about the near-term business outlook of their employer. our market-wide sentiment measure has superior performance compared to existing proxies of investor sentiment and commonly-studied macroeconomic variables. the forward-looking property of this data is also evident in predicting industry returns or portfolio returns sorted on characteristics, such as size, age, risk, profitability, dividend payout, tangibility, financial constraints and growth opportunities. importantly, market-wide employee sentiment has relative power in predicting future asset returns after controlling for firm-level employee sentiment. the predictive power of aggregate employee online data is explained by investors’ biased beliefs about expected cash flows and volatility. these results indicate that financial models can be enriched with sentiment factors derived from various big data sources and stakeholders, providing insights into mispriced assets and assisting investment decisions. © 2021 elsevier ltd"
"in the road infrastructure sector, public-private partnership (ppp) projects involve the implementation of project finance principles through the signing of a long-term contract between the public authority and a group of sponsors assembled in a special purpose vehicle (spv). however, although ppp sponsors play a very important role in spv formation, the literature does not provide sufficient information to permit a detailed understanding of such creation processes. therefore, this study provides insight into the mechanisms associated with the way ppp sponsors establish relationships among themselves in order to form spvs. the approach employs social network concepts and exponential random graph model (ergm) techniques. the analysis is focused on tie-formation processes in sponsor networks across the bidding and financial close stages of ppp road projects in canada, chile, and the us between 1993 and 2019. results show that, despite some differences in the studied jurisdictions, dyadic (i.e., repeated relationships) and structural (i.e., transitivity) factors are the most influential properties driving bidding consortium and spv creation procedures. conclusions indicate that sponsors' behavioral patterns are highly influenced by trust-based mechanisms. further research is required to continue understanding the role of other ppp players and the effect of the external institutional environment on ppp networks.  © 2021 american society of civil engineers."

"background: adversity has consistently been found to predict poor mental health outcomes in youth. perhaps the most omnipresent form of adversity in the past several decades has been the coronavirus pandemic of 2020, a global health crisis linked to elevated rates of numerous forms of youth psychopathology. the ongoing nature of the pandemic renders it critical to identify the mechanisms underlying its effects on mental health. methods: the current study examines pandemic-related disruption across multiple domains (e.g., home life, finances) as an etiologic moderator of several common forms of youth psychopathology. participants were 637 adolescent twin pairs from the twin study of behavioral and emotional development in children (tbed-c). mothers reported on disruption experienced by the family, using the epidemic-pandemic impacts inventory. results: a series of biometric genotype-by-environment interaction models revealed that disruption augmented the nonshared environmental contributions to emotional distress and conduct problems but had little effect on the etiology of attention-deficit hyperactivity problems. conclusions: our results indicate that identical and fraternal twin similarity in both emotional symptoms and conduct problems decreased with greater disruption, such that children in the same family became less alike, and did so regardless of their degree of genetic resemblance. put differently, each twin sibling appeared to have their own idiosyncratic experience of pandemic-related disruptions, with downstream consequences for their mental health. © 2021 the authors"

"this study reviews the literature of online peer-to-peer (p2p) lending from 2008 until 2020 as an emergent but fast spreading phenomenon in the context of digital finance. previous literature is geographically skewed towards united states and china with focus on determinants of funding success and loan attributes. recent studies shift from using logit and survival analysis methods to examine funding success and default predictions, towards applying artificial intelligence. there is a controversial debate regarding adopting a self-regulatory approach versus stricter financial institutions-based regulations with a few studies suggesting a hybrid approach. we suggest several avenues for future research, such as examining the determinants and performance of p2p lending platforms in emerging and developing markets; regulatory differences, the effects of behavioral characteristics such as cultural impact, language, information technology literacy, and the innovation quotient on p2p funding attributes; and the relationship between p2p lending and traditional finance channels. © 2021 the author(s)"

"purpose: in the rise of offices designed to support activity-based working (abw), parts of industry have fully transitioned to open-plan environments and then later to unassigned seating, whereas other parts, such as tertiary education, are still in the process of moving away from individual offices. there are a few relevant studies to understand how occupants from industry sectors with different levels of adoption of abw perceived environments designed to support this way of working. this paper aims to contribute to the knowledge gap by providing insight into workers’ satisfaction and dissatisfaction from open-plan offices designed to support abw along with the key predictors of perceived productivity. design/methodology/approach: a data set of 2,090 post-occupancy evaluation surveys conducted in five sectors – tertiary education, finance, construction, property/asset management and design/engineering – was analyzed. anova and confirmatory factor analysis (cfa) were conducted for the survey questionnaires. first, anova tests were conducted for the whole sample with perceived productivity as the dependent variable. a seven-point likert scale with five theoretical factors was generated with all survey questionnaires. cfa was performed to show the factor loadings. in addition, regression analyses were carried out for each of factor item taken as the independent variable, where perceived productivity was the dependent variable. key sources of satisfaction and dissatisfaction per sector were analyzed and differences between occupants reporting a negative or positive impact on their productivity were also investigated. finally, open-ended comments were analyzed to show the key sources of dissatisfaction based on open-ended comments. findings: workers from construction were the most satisfied, followed by finance and tertiary education. occupants from all industry sectors consistently rated their workspaces highly on biophilic and interior design. distraction and privacy received the lowest scores from all sectors. open-ended comments showed mismatches between spatial and behavioral dimensions of abw both for satisfaction and perceived productivity. interior design was the strongest predictor for perceived productivity for all sectors. findings dispel the notion that abw implementation may not be suitable for certain industries, as long as the three key pillars of abw are fully implemented, including design, behavior and technology. originality/value: this paper provides insight into workers’ satisfaction and dissatisfaction from open-plan offices designed to support abw in different industry sectors along with the key predictors of perceived productivity. © 2021, emerald publishing limited."
"various studies raise concerns over the pervasive poverty among women after retirement. although much research is available on retirement planning, the advent of behavioral finance and the integration of psychological concepts with financial planning and saving behavior have made the phenomenon more critical. this study focuses on how the interaction between financial literacy as a cognitive characteristic and retirement goal clarity, future time perspective, attitude toward retirement, risk tolerance, and social group support as psychological characteristics influence women's retirement planning behavior. we use partial least squares regression through pls-3 with multi group analysis to test a set of theory-based hypotheses. our results reveal a positive association of future time perspective, retirement goal clarity, and social group support with retirement planning behavior, which are moderated by financial literacy. future time perspective and retirement goal clarity also play mediating roles. our study has implications for financial planning professionals, advisors, and consumers. © 2021 elsevier inc."
"past studies on the causal relationship between online sentiment and implied volatility indices report mixed results. in this paper, we employ a daily happiness index extracted from twitter as a proxy for online sentiment to investigate the relationship between sentiment and the chicago board of option exchange volatility indices. applying a nonparametric wave-based granger causality test, allows us close examination of frequencies and periods of causality. investigating four different subsample periods, we evidence that daily happiness sentiment consistently manifests short-term causality of implied volatility indices. this is evidenced over our sample period as a whole, and for three out of four investigated subperiods—the exception being a subperiod of three years following the global financial crisis. additional diebold and yilmaz (2012) spillover testing evidences that the causal relationship between happiness and implied volatility is strongest for stable low happiness subperiods. importantly, we also evidence intervals where spillovers from happiness to implied volatility spike sharply. this suggests that the relationship between happiness and implied volatility is heavily conditioned by exogenous factors. consequently, while we identify consistent short-term causality of happiness to implied volatility measures, economically meaningful forecasting of implied volatility from happiness remains elusive. our findings should be of considerable interest to investors and practitioners, as well as to behavioral finance researchers interested in how sentiment shapes the ‘uncertainty of uncertainty. © 2021 board of trustees of the university of illinois"

"we examine whether investors' attention on salient firm characteristics affects information spillovers during corporate earnings announcements. for market participants in china, the stock name is a salient feature of listed companies. we find that the market reaction of non-announcing firms to earnings reports of announcing firms is greater across firms with similar stock names. the incremental information spillovers among similarly named stocks are stronger for larger announcing firms and on days with fewer earnings announcements. the incremental information spillovers between similarly named stocks do not fully reverse in the post-announcement period, consistent with persistent investor behavior predicted by the salience theory. there are also significant return comovements among similarly named stocks. our findings suggest that investors with limited attention are likely to focus on salient stock names and overestimate the economic connections between similarly name stocks. our study extends the behavioral finance literature by showing how investors' attention on salient firm features can bias their reaction to unrelated peer disclosures. © 2021 elsevier b.v."
"self-interest is a central driver of attitudes and behaviors, but people also act against their immediate self-interest through prosocial behaviors, voting incongruously with their finances, or punishing others at personal cost. how much people believe that self-interest causes attitudes and behaviors is important, because this belief may shape regulation, shared narratives, and institutional structures. an influential paper claimed that people overestimate the power of self-interest on others’ attitudes and behavioral intentions (miller & ratner, 1998). we present two registered, close, and successful replications (u.s. mturk, n = 800; u.k. prolific, n = 799) that compared actual to estimated intentions, with open data and code. consistent with the original article, participants overestimated the impact of payment on blood donation in study 1, ds = 0.59 [0.51, 0.66], 0.57 [0.49, 0.64], and overestimated the importance of smoking status for smoking policy preferences in study 4, ds = 0.75 [0.59, 0.90], 0.84 [0.73, 0.96]. these replications included two extensions: 1) communal orientation as a moderator of overestimation and 2) a more detailed measure of self-interest in study 4 (ordinal smoking status). communal orientation did not predict overestimation, and the ordinal smoking measure yielded similar results to the main study. verifying the overestimation error informs behavioral theories across several fields and has practical implications for institutions that require trust and cooperation. all materials, data, and code are available at osf.io/57mdc/ © 2021 university of california press. all rights reserved."

"in most real-world large-scale online applications (e.g., e-commerce or finance), customer acquisition is usually a multi-step conversion process of audiences. for example, an impression->click->purchase process is usually performed of audiences for e-commerce platforms. however, it is more difficult to acquire customers in financial advertising (e.g., credit card advertising) than in traditional advertising. on the one hand, the audience multi-step conversion path is longer, an impression->click->application->approval->activation process usually occurs during the audience conversion for credit card business in financial advertising. on the other hand, the positive feedback is sparser (class imbalance) step by step, and it is difficult to obtain the final positive feedback due to the delayed feedback of activation. therefore, it is necessary to use the positive feedback information of the former step to alleviate the class imbalance of the latter step. multi-task learning is a typical solution in this direction. while considerable multi-task efforts have been made in this direction, a long-standing challenge is how to explicitly model the long-path sequential dependence among audience multi-step conversions for improving the end-to-end conversion. in this paper, we propose an adaptive information transfer multi-task (aitm) framework, which models the sequential dependence among audience multi-step conversions via the adaptive information transfer (ait) module. the ait module can adaptively learn what and how much information to transfer for different conversion stages. besides, by combining the behavioral expectation calibrator in the loss function, the aitm framework can yield more accurate end-to-end conversion identification. the proposed framework is deployed in meituan app, which utilizes it to real-timely show a banner to the audience with a high end-to-end conversion rate for meituan co-branded credit cards. offline experimental results on both industrial and public real-world datasets clearly demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significantly better performance compared with state-of-the-art baselines. besides, online experiments also demonstrate significant improvement compared with existing online models. furthermore,we have released the source code of the proposed framework at https://github.com/xidongbo/aitm. © 2021 acm."
"we examine the effect of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd) on individual-level financial distress. adhd is the most common mental disorder among children and is characterized by behaviors such as inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness that interfere with school and home life. in a representative panel, we find that individuals with more severe adhd symptoms during childhood have more difficulty paying bills and are more likely to be delinquent on bill payments in adulthood. further, those with more severe symptoms are less likely to have precautionary savings and more likely to have to delay buying necessities. these effects exist across the full range of adhd symptom scores and are not driven by the most severe cases of adhd; this is consistent with recent evidence that adhd symptoms occur on a continuum. preliminary evidence suggests that medication for behavioral issues may mitigate the effect of adhd symptoms on financial distress.  © 2020 the author(s) 2020. published by oxford university press on behalf of the european finance association. all rights reserved. for permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oup.com."

"investors generally make decisions based on risk and stock returns, and their decisions are influenced by two factors, namely macroeconomic variables and microeconomic variables. the behavioral factors affecting investment decisions are investigated in the area of behavioral finance. in other words, behavioral finance focuses on specific human behavior attributes and their utilization in asset pricing. behavioral asset pricing is the result of applying behavioral finance theories within traditional asset pricing theories. although there are many asset-pricing models, due to their weaknesses and incompleteness as well as the necessity of investigating behavioral factors, this study attempted to model asset pricing using behavioral models.the population of the study included all listed firms in tehran stock exchange over the years 2008 to 2018, and the sample was selected through systematic elimination of the population. given these conditions, 141 firms were selected as the sample. the hypotheses were then tested by designing multivariate regression models.the results showed that using fama-macbeth approach, accounting information risk, investors' trading behavior, and investors' sentiments had a significant and direct impact on firms' stock returns.thus, it is argued that behavioral variables can play a significant role in modeling asset pricing. © 2021 university of tehran, college of farabi. all rights reserved."
"background: there is growing interest in financing housing and supportive services for homeless individuals through medicaid. permanent supportive housing (psh), which integrates non-time-limited housing with supportive services for people who are disabled and chronically homeless, has seen rapid growth in the last decade, but clear evidence on the long-term impacts of psh, needed to guide state efforts to finance some psh services through medicaid, is lacking. objective: assess changes in medicaid expenditures and utilization associated with receiving psh. design: cohort study using a difference-in-differences approach. participants: a total of 1226 pa medicaid enrollees who entered psh 2011–2016 and remained in psh for 180 days or more, and a matched comparison cohort of 970 enrollees experiencing housing instability who did not receive psh. main measures: medicaid spending in aggregate, and on behavioral and physical health services; emergency department (ed) visits and inpatient hospital stays. key results: three years after psh entry, spending decreased by an average of $145/month in the psh cohort relative to changes in the comparison cohort (p = 0.046), with the greatest relative spending reductions occurring for residential behavioral health ($64, p < 0.001) and inpatient non-behavioral health services ($89, p = 0.001). we also found relative reductions in ed use (4.7 visits/100 person-months, p = 0.010) and inpatient hospital stays (1.6 visits/100 person-months, p < 0.001). conclusions: these results can inform emerging state efforts to finance psh services through medicaid. additional state expenditures to expand financing for psh services could be partially offset by reductions in medicaid spending, in part by facilitating a shift in treatment to outpatient from acute care settings. © 2021, society of general internal medicine."

"optimal calculation of securities investment is a hot and difficult problem. at present, the research mainly focuses on genetic algorithm, quadratic programming, ant colony algorithm and so on, and the results are relatively many. but these algorithms still have some shortcomings. intelligent algorithm is a general term for a class of algorithms. it means that human beings are inspired by the collective behaviors of various organisms in nature and find better optimal strategies by imitating these intelligent behaviors. with the progress of science and technology, some of the traditional optimization method has been unable to effectively solve complex problems in reality, especially the np hard problem. the scholars began to adopt more population of swarm intelligence optimization algorithm is used to, and showed the significant advantage. in the field of engineering application and scientific research, swarm intelligence algorithm is paid more and more attention by scholars. this paper mainly studies the analysis of intelligent optimization algorithm based on big data in behavioral finance of securities investment. in this paper, after the accumulation and degradation of the collected original data, the optimization calculation is carried out on the condition that the portfolio income remains unchanged. the results of this paper show that compared with genetic algorithm and differential evolution algorithm, the latter result is more suitable for the investment model discussed in this paper. © 2021 ieee."
"cyberattack is one of the severe threats in the digital world as it encompasses everything related to personal information, health, finances, intellectual properties, and even national security. password-based authentication is the most practiced authentication system, however, is vulnerable to several attacks such as dictionary attack, shoulder surfing attack, and guessing attack. here, a new keystroke dynamics-based hybrid nanogenerator for biometric authentication and identification integrated with artificial intelligence (ai) is reported. keystroke dynamics offer behavioral and contextual information that can distinguish and authorize the individuals based on their typing rhythms. the hybrid electromagnetic-triboelectric nanogenerators/sensors efficiently convert the keystroke mechanical energy into electrical signals, which are fed into an artificial neural network based ai system. the self-powered hybrid sensors-based biometric authentication system integrated with a neural network achieves an accuracy of 99% and offers a promising hybrid security layer against password vulnerability. © 2021 the authors. advanced science published by wiley-vch gmbh"
"smartphone apps such as robinhood and public that promise to ""democratize investing""have risen in popularity over the past few years. these apps allow retail investors, who often possess little prior investing experience, to trade stocks, options, and other securities easily and inexpensively, often commission-free. it seems plausible that the interaction patterns of these new apps may significantly influence trading behaviors of their users. but so far, there is little formal design guidance on how such apps should be designed. this paper introduces a set of design guidelines for encouraging healthy investing behaviors by drawing on three bodies of related work: 1) findings from finance and economics literature on healthy investment practices, 2) the dual process theory from behavioral sciences, and 3) design metaphors used in interfaces with uncertain rewards. using these guidelines, we qualitatively analyze the user interfaces of some popular investment platforms. our analysis reveal that, unfortunately, popular trading apps generally do not follow design patterns that encourage healthier trading behaviors. we discuss design implications and opportunities for future design. © 2021 owner/author."
"initial coin offerings (icos) are a novel form of funding that has driven billions of dollars into the blockchain ecosystem, potentially challenging traditional funding vehicles such as business angel or venture capital investments. however, little is known of entrepreneurs’ rationales for leveraging this emerging form of financing. this article investigates the economic and behavioral factors that motivate entrepreneurs to fund their startup operations with icos. by conducting in-depth interviews with c-level managers or founders of ico-funded startups, our analysis reveals four dimensions that have an impact on the decision: (1) funding, (2) community building, (3) tokenomics, and (4) personal and ideological drivers. our findings suggest that the entrepreneur’s social identity in conjunction with the enabling mechanisms of the blockchain technology shape entrepreneurial pursuits and funding choice. we contribute to the literature on entrepreneurial finance by increasing understanding of icos and to the literature on entrepreneurial decision making by providing qualitative insights into the influence of founder identity on key decisions in startups such as financing. © 2020, the author(s)."
"this study shows how investing in mutual funds involves an additional risk, which we call management risk as a consequence of the uncertainty in the results of active management. to address this issue, we analyze a sample of 2539 us equity mutual funds. for comparative purposes, we differentiate among index funds and actively managed mutual funds with different investment styles. we observe that performance distribution shows negative mean, negative skewness, and excess kurtosis. results also show that management risk is not rewarded with higher abnormal performance. moreover, higher active management prices are linked to funds with higher management risk and negative asymmetry. therefore, investors seem to be risk-seeking since they are paying more to participate in high asymmetric bets. finally, we attempt to solve this puzzle from the behavioral finance perspective. © 2021, the author(s), under exclusive licence to springer nature limited."
"in the context of growing literature about behavioral finance and experimental research, there is an urgent need to expand this contemporary branch in emerging markets in general and vietnam in particular. therefore, this paper aimed at finding evidence of prospect theory in vietnam using a battery of experimental approach. the objective of experiment design is to understand the economic market and represent almost all risk suffering levels. the research outcomes strengthened arguments of prospect theory in terms of both slope and reference point. this research found evidence for the hypothesis that the utility curve reference point lies in the positive domain. this suggested that in the case of low profitability, investors could still prefer risk over certainty, but they shall be more risk averse as returns are increased. besides, the relationship between loss aversion and other behavioral biases was also examined, and evidence of strong relation between loss aversion and anchoring and overreaction was found, while there existed no clear correlation between loss aversion and overconfidence. the findings of this paper shed light on current research about behavioral finance, especially about prospect theory in vietnam, suggesting a pilot approach to find evidence of various behavioral biases that might affect stock market investors’ decisions. © 2021, associated management consultants pvt. ltd.. all rights reserved."
"purpose: the social and behavioral health of older adults is of particular concern during the covid-19 pandemic. it is estimated that at least 50% of older adults in the u.s. have pets; while pets may be a source of support, they could also pose unique challenges during an already trying time. we aimed to investigate how pets impacted the everyday lives of older adults in the early stages of the covid-19 pandemic. methods: a large survey of u.s. pet owners (n = 2,068) was administered to assess the impact of relationships with pets during covid-19 on human health and well-being. we conducted bivariate analyses to compare levels of social support, loneliness, pet attachment, and family income for a subset of older adults (ages 65 and older) with a younger comparison group (ages 18–64). using thematic and content analysis, we analyzed two open-ended prompts from age 65+ respondents (n = 122): (1) the pros and cons of living with pets during the pandemic, and (2) advice for those living with pets in future pandemics. results: older adults, on average, reported lower levels of social support and less loneliness than respondents below age 65. there were no significant differences in strength of attachment to pets nor income between the younger and older respondents. for the open-ended prompt regarding pros and cons, we coded three emerging themes and related sub-themes: (1) pros (company; more time together; life purpose or meaning; love; support; stress relief; routine; distraction; exercise), (2) cons (general worry; potential for illness; limited participation; veterinary care access; obtaining supplies; difficulty meeting pet needs; financial concerns), and (3) no difference. advice shared was coded into 13 themes/sub-themes: pets' health and welfare; make plans; veterinary information; treat pets like family; don't abandon pets; human health and well-being; stay calm; enjoy pets; keep routine; be careful of transmission; seek community resources; keep supplies stocked; and finances. conclusions: pets may fulfill some social and emotional needs for older adults during this particularly isolating event; equally important to consider are the challenges that may be precipitated by and/or exacerbated by this public health emergency. © copyright © 2021 applebaum, ellison, struckmeyer, zsembik and mcdonald."
"to predict stock prices with effective information has always been a problem of great significance in the fields of behavioral finance. in this paper, we predict the stock prices with novel online data sources. for some emerging countries (such as china), individual investors often obtain trading information from online social media platforms. therefore, stock features extracted from social media platforms are likely to include valuable information. we obtained the data of users and stocks they followed from eastymoney, china's largest social media platform, and generate daily social networks. then we calculated the network variable of each stock as a supplement to traditional variables, and predicted the close prices of the sse 50 constituent stocks using the lstm model. the empirical results show that the social network variable can effectively improve the prediction accuracy. our results can help investors improve forecasting accuracy. our findings can help investors enhancing the understanding of the link between social networks and stock prices. © 2021"
"constraints and limits to adaptation are critical to understanding the extent to which human and natural systems can successfully adapt to climate change. we conduct a systematic review of 1,682 academic studies on human adaptation responses to identify patterns in constraints and limits to adaptation for different regions, sectors, hazards, adaptation response types, and actors. using definitions of constraints and limits provided by the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc), we find that most literature identifies constraints to adaptation but that there is limited literature focused on limits to adaptation. central and south america and small islands generally report greater constraints and both hard and soft limits to adaptation. technological, infrastructural, and ecosystem-based adaptation suggest more evidence of constraints and hard limits than other types of responses. individuals and households face economic and socio-cultural constraints which also inhibit behavioral adaptation responses and may lead to limits. finance, governance, institutional, and policy constraints are most prevalent globally. these findings provide early signposts for boundaries of human adaptation and are of high relevance for guiding proactive adaptation financing and governance from local to global scales. © 2021, the author(s)."
"herd effect is a manifestation of behavioral finance, and its essence is the following behavior brought by investors' irrational herd mentality. herd effect in the stock market will affect the transmission of market information, and even lead to overreaction and affect the stability of the market. therefore, it is of great significance to study the effect of herd behavior on the stock market. based on the csad model, this paper makes appropriate modifications to the model according to the actual situation of china's stock market and selects the constituent stocks of the sse 50 index as samples to test the herd effect of china's stock market. the empirical test shows that the herd effect of the shanghai stock exchange is not significant at the 5% significance level. this shows that china has launched a series of policies in the capital market in recent years, so that china's capital market has been improved to a certain extent, the market investment concept is becoming more and more perfect and mature.  © 2021 acm."
"according to the behavioral finance theory, the psychology and behavior of investors in capital market have an important impact on the fluctuation of stock index. therefore, this paper assumes that there is a certain internal mechanism between investor sentiment and stock index, which can predict the overall price change of the stock market. the text mining technology and sentiment analysis method can be used to generate a total of six categorypositive and negativeinvestor sentiment time series data, with three orders; the methods such as unit root test, granger causality test and factor analysis are used to construct the composite index of sse investor sentiment, and then the support vector machine and neural network are adopted to predict the stock market price changes and conduct the hypothesis verification. the results indicate that the sse investor sentiment composite index constructed by using the text data of online stock market forum and stock transaction data can improve the accuracy of stock index trend prediction, which is conducive to better decision-making of the government, online platforms, listed companies, and investment entities. © published under licence by iop publishing ltd."

"background pediatric health care quality in the united states varies, but the reasons for variation are not fully understood. differences in pediatric practices' organizational characteristics, such as organizational structures, strategies employed to improve quality, and other contextual factors, may contribute to the variation observed. purpose to assess the relationship between organizational characteristics and performance on clinical quality (cq) and patient experience (pe) measures in primary care pediatric practices in massachusetts. methodology a 60-item questionnaire that assessed the presence of selected organizational characteristics was sent to 172 pediatric practice managers in massachusetts between december 2017 and february 2018. the associations between select organizational characteristics and publicly available cq and pe scores were analyzed using analysis of variance; open-ended survey questions were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. results eighty-six practices (50.0%) responded; 80 (46.5%) were included in the primary analysis. having a quality champion (p =.03), offering co-located specialty services (e.g., behavioral health; p =.04), being a privately owned practice (p =.04), believing that patients and families feel respected (p =.03), and having a lower percentage of patients (10%-25%) covered by public health insurance (p =.04) were associated with higher cq scores. higher pe scores were associated with private practice ownership (p =.0006). qualitative analysis suggested organizational culture and external factors, such as health care finance, may affect quality. conclusions both modifiable organizational practices and factors external to a practice may affect quality of care. addressing differences in practice performance may not be reducible to implementation of changes in single organizational characteristics. practice implications pediatric practices seeking to improve quality of care may wish to adopt the strategies that were associated with higher performance on quality measures, but additional studies are needed to better understand the mechanisms behind these associations and how they relate to each other.  © lippincott williams & wilkins."
"background: the transition to residency marks a significant shift in the financial circumstances of medical trainees. despite existing resources, residents still cite uncertainty in this domain. a personal finance curriculum is needed to close this educational gap and improve the financial well-being of trainees. methods: the curriculum was developed using kern's framework. two needs assessments informed the consensus development of goals and objectives, educational strategies, and assessments. course material was hosted online for asynchronous review and complemented by two 1-hour webinars. the curriculum was piloted at one institution. participants completed (1) knowledge assessments before and after the intervention, (2) a survey of reactions to the curriculum, and (3) an assessment of financial behavioral changes after the intervention. results: thirty-seven residents (37/49, 76%) enrolled in the curriculum. among participants, 20 (20/37, 54%) completed the curriculum. most participants agreed or strongly agreed that the content was relevant (20/20, 100%) and clearly presented (19/20, 95%) and that they would recommend the curriculum to other residents (20/20, 100%). performance on the knowledge assessment improved 21% after the intervention (mean ± sd = pretest 57% ± 17%, posttest = 78% ± 12%; p < 0.001). most residents (17/20, 85%) also reported behavioral changes including setting new financial goals (12/20, 60%), taking new action toward financial planning (11/20, 55%), and changing financial habits (6/20, 30%). there were no direct financial costs incurred in the implementation of this pilot. conclusions: this is a successful pilot of a virtual personal finance curriculum with positive outcomes data. addressing this problem at scale will require buy-in from educators around the country to deliver this information to residents that may not otherwise seek it out. future study should assess curricular outcomes in other settings and the durability of acquired knowledge and behavioral changes over time. © 2021 by the society for academic emergency medicine"
"best practice standards for measuring analyte levels in saliva recommend that all biospecimens be tested in replicate with mean concentrations used in statistical analyses. this approach prioritizes minimizing laboratory-based measurement error but, in the process, expends considerable resources. we explore the possibility that, due to advances in salivary assay precision, the contribution of laboratory-based measurement error in salivary analyte data is very small relative to more important and meaningful variability in analyte levels across biological replicates (i.e., between different specimens). to evaluate this possibility, we examine the utility of the repeatability intra-class correlation (ricc) as an additional index of salivary analyte data precision. using randomly selected subsamples (ns=200 and 60) of salivary analyte data collected as part of a larger epidemiologic study, we compute the riccs for seven commonly assayed salivary measures in biobehavioral research - cortisol, alpha-amylase, c-reactive protein, interlekin-6, uric acid, secretory immunoglobulin a, and testosterone. we assess the sensitivity of ricc estimates to assay type and the unique distributions of the underlying analyte data. we also use simulations to examine the bias, precision, and coverage probability of ricc estimates calculated for small to large sample sizes. for each analyte, the riccs revealed that less than 5% of variation in analyte levels was attributable to laboratory-based measurement error. ricc estimates were similar across all analytes despite differences in analyte levels, average intra-assay coefficients of variation, and in the distributional properties of the data. guidelines for calculating ricc are provided to enable investigators and laboratory staff to apply this metric and more accurately quantify, and communicate, the magnitude of laboratory-based measurement error in their data. by helping investigators scale measurement error relative to more scientifically meaningful variability between biological replicates, the application of the ricc has the potential to influence research strategies and tactics such that resources (e.g., finances, effort, number/volume of biospecimens) are allocated more efficiently and effectively. © 2021 elsevier ltd"

"introduction: the covid-19 pandemic has created challenges for every segment of the u.s. population, including military personnel and their families. the triservice nursing research program's military family research interest group (fig) formed a collaboration with blue star families, a civilian non-profit organization, to identify potential issues faced by military families during the pandemic. data collection methods: the pain points poll was introduced online by blue star families, and findings were aggregated weekly between march 18 and may 26, 2020. volunteer poll respondents were mainly recruited through social media outreach. fig-informed questions were incorporated in week 4 of polling and focused on workplace environment, financial health, social support, physical and mental health, child behavior, utilization of family care plans, and general well-being. data were collected to gain real-time insights into the major challenges posed by the pandemic. findings from fig-informed questions were collaboratively reviewed and analyzed by fig and bsf teams. data-driven recommendations were made to stakeholders to improve processes and reprioritize investments for services that aim to alleviate the impact of covid-19 on military families. findings: a total of 2,895 military family units (i.e., service members and spouses) responded to the poll, a majority of which (88%) represented active duty family units. although the majority of families (range: 59%-69%) noted no impact to their finances, approximately one in five families endorsed dipping into their savings during the pandemic. a majority of respondents (69.5%) reported taking active measures to support their mental health, endorsing various strategies. among parents of special needs children, 45% of active duty families and 60% of single-parent service members reported the inability to maintain continued services for their children. a majority of parents with school-aged children (65%) reported child behavioral changes due to their child's inability to socialize with peers. among military service members, 41% were concerned about obtaining fair performance evaluations during the crisis. conclusions: the covid-19 pandemic produced significant challenges for military families. collaboration between military and civilian partners can inform policies and appropriate strategies to mitigate the impact of covid-19 for military families. the findings presented here provide insight into areas where military families can be supported for optimal outcomes during unprecedented times.  © 2021 published by oxford university press on behalf of the association of military surgeons of the united states 2021. this work is written by (a) us government employee(s) and is in the public domain in the us."
"the stock market is an aggregation of investor sentiment that affects daily changes in stock prices. investor sentiment remained a mystery and challenge over time, inviting researchers to comprehend the market trends. the entry of behavioral scientists in and around the 1980s brought in the market trading’s human dimensions. shortly after that, due to the digitization of exchanges, the mix of traders changed as institutional traders started using algorithmic trading (at) on computers. nevertheless, the effects of investor sentiment did not disappear and continued to intrigue market researchers. though market sentiment plays a significant role in timing investment decisions, classical finance models largely ignored the role of investor sentiment in asset pricing. for knowing if the market price is value-driven, the investor would isolate components of irrationality from the price, as reflected in the sentiment. investor sentiment is an expression of irrational expectations of a stock’s risk-return profile that is not justified by available information. in this context, the paper aims to predict the next-day trend in the index prices for the centralized indian national stock exchange (nse) deploying machine learning algorithms like support vector machine, random forest, gradient boosting, and deep neural networks. the training set is historical nse closing price data from june 1st, 2013-june 30th, 2020. additionally, the authors factor technical indicators like moving average (ma), moving average convergence-divergence (macd), k (%) oscillator and corresponding three days moving average d (%), relative strength indicator (rsi) value, and the lw (r%) indicator for the same period. the predictive power of deep neural networks over other machine learning techniques is established in the paper, demonstrating the future scope of deep learning in multi-parameter time series prediction. © 2021 igi global. all rights reserved."

"the behavioral finance studies generally analyse the relationship between investor moods, caused by weather factors and indices returns via investor moods. the present study examines the relationship between three weather factors (temperature, humidity, and wind speed) in capital cities (namely beijing for china, tokyo for japan, victoria city for hong kong, new delhi for india and singapore for singapore), and sample stock indices (shanghai stock exchange from china, nikkei 225 from japan, hang seng index from hong kong, bse sensex from india and singapore exchange limited from singapore) of selected asian countries. this study applied statistical tools like descriptive statistics, adf test, var module and adopted the granger causality approach. the found that among the three weather variables, temperature recorded a statistically significant influence on the returns of shanghai stock exchange (unidirectional linkage), hang seng index (unidirectional linkage) and also bse sensex (bi-directional linkage). wind speed recorded bi-directional linkages with hang seng index. the findings of this study could help the investors in making better investment management decisions. it is found that there are valuable opportunities to international investors for diversifying their stocks. the study does contribute to the behavioral finance literature. © 2019, springer science+business media, llc, part of springer nature."
"behavioral finance theory stipulates that the disposition effect plays an important role in inducing momentum. using quantile regression analysis, this research is twofold. first is to examine the relation between the unrealized capital gains and expected returns. second is to examine the capability of disposition effect as one of the underreaction models in inducing momentum in the most extreme quantiles (0.05th and 0.95th) of expected returns. to do so, we use a sample of 5176 firms, from january 1998 to june 2015. following grinblatt and han (j financ econ 78:311–339, 2005), the findings show that the relation between unrealized capital gains and expected returns is significantly positive and decline as the quantiles of expected returns increase from the lowest to the median expected return quantiles. however, they become significantly negative and rise with the increase of expected returns quantiles above the median expected returns quantile. this indicates that disposition-prone investors exhibit disposition behavior below the median and median expected return quantiles, but they display the opposite behavior above the median quantiles of expected returns. our findings also suggest that the disposition effect is not a good noisy proxy for inducing momentum at the lowest quantile of expected returns (0.05th). however, the disposition effect induces contrarian behavior at the highest quantile of expected returns (0.95th). © 2020, springer science+business media, llc, part of springer nature."
"in canada, financial advisors and dealers are required by provincial securities commissions and self-regulatory organizations—charged with direct regulation over investment dealers and mutual fund dealers—to respectively collect and maintain know your client (kyc) information, such as their age or risk tolerance, for investor accounts. with this information, investors, under their advisor’s guidance, make decisions on their investments that are presumed to be beneficial to their investment goals. our unique dataset is provided by a financial investment dealer with over 50,000 accounts for over 23,000 clients covering the period from january 1st to august 12th 2019. we use a modified behavioral finance recency, frequency, monetary model for engineering features that quantify investor behaviours, and unsupervised machine learning clustering algorithms to find groups of investors that behave similarly. we show that the kyc information—such as gender, residence region, and marital status—does not explain client behaviours, whereas eight variables for trade and transaction frequency and volume are most informative. hence, our results should encourage financial regulators and advisors to use more advanced metrics to better understand and predict investor behaviours. © 2021 by the authors."
"it has been a challenge to provide an explanation of the behavior of different investors in different markets. behavioral finance tends to look at the psychological and emotional factors related to the stock market and may influence behavior of investor and the efficiency of the market. the aim of this study is to investigate the influence of psychological and emotional factors on the behavior of investors in the dubai financial market. the importance of this empirical paper is developed through the essential step in investment management which is decision making. this study was conducted to provide an explanation of how factors related to behavioral finance may influence the dubai financial market. the data for this study was collected through a questionnaire distributed to investors in the dubai stock market and then were analyzed using the multiple correspondence analysis. this paper collected the response of 294 out of 500 questionnaires provided to dubai investors. the results of the analysis showed that investors with a high level of education are associated with low levels of behavioral biases, and individuals who invest amounts up to 20,000 aed are subject to behavioral biases. based on these results, it can be concluded that information in the market lead to market efficiency. © 2021. all rights reserved."
"the field of behavioral finance lacks a homogeneous and structured theoretical framework. the purpose of this paper is to contribute to further systematization in the field by analyzing the impacts of education, gender and age on investor behavior and sentiment. the study is based on online anonymous surveys given to 106 professional investors active in the spanish market during february 2017. the survey includes control questions, seven questions regarding investors' sentiment to elaborate a confidence index and twenty questions concerning the practitioner's view of behavioral finance. we first identify a gap between the relevance of behavioral finance and the lack of education in the field. we also find a clear misalignment between the investors and their clients' profiles related to their level of confidence. in that regard, the use of the institutional investor confidence index mitigates self-perception bias and is a key element in determining investors’ real profiles. consistent with prior research, we find that female investors view themselves as more driven by rational analysis and are more risk averse while younger investors are more influenced by cognitive and emotional biases. as a key contribution, we establish a model to determine investors’ sentiment, which shows that female and more experienced practitioners exhibit higher levels of optimism and confidence. © 2021 the authors; behavioral finance; investor survey; sentiment; education; age; gender. © 2021 the authors"
"this study assesses the level of financial vulnerability of indonesian households using data from the household's balance sheet survey (survei neraca rumah tangga/snrt) 2016 and 2017. the snrt are micro-unit of household data that contains information on preferences and behavior. through both objective and subjective measurements of the household financial vulnerability index (fvi), we find that the financial vulnerability of indonesian households is not only strongly influenced by income factors, but also by finance-related behavioral characteristics and several socio-economic factors. as a consistency and robustness check, we also estimate econometric models using the indonesian family life survey (ifls) panel data for the periods 1993, 1997, 2000, 2007 and 2014. our study then conclude that the level of household financial vulnerability decreased in 2017. moreover, the study suggests that we should carefully monitor the behaviour of middle income group as they contribute significantly to the household financial vulnerability in indonesia. © 2020 elsevier b.v."
"purpose: the purpose of this literature review paper is to define consumer finance, describe the scope of consumer finance and discuss its future research directions. design/methodology/approach: in this paper, consumer finance is used as a synonym of household finance. consumers refer to individuals and families. after defining the term “consumer finance,” we conducted a critical review of consumer finance as an interdisciplinary research field in terms of money managing, insuring, borrowing and saving/investing. future research directions are also discussed. findings: this paper discusses similarities and differences among several terms such as consumer finance, household finance, personal finance, family finance and behavioral finance. the paper also reviewed key studies on consumer financial behavior around four key financial functions, namely, money management, insurance, loan and saving/investment and several nontraditional topics such as fintech and financial capability/literacy. the paper also introduced several datasets of consumer finance commonly used in the united states and china. originality/value: this paper clarified several similar terms related to consumer finance and sorted out the diverse literature of consumer finance in multiple disciplines such as economics, finance and consumer science, which provide a foundation for generating more fruitful research in consumer finance in the future. © 2020, emerald publishing limited."
"aiming at the non-linear, dynamic time-varying complex relationship between the real estate industry and the banking industry, taking the daily data from 2005-01-04 to 2018-12-28 as the research sample, the dynamic time-varying copula function was used to test the nonlinear interdependence and the risk contagion between china's real estate industry and the banking industry, and three contagion channels were explored based on financial association theory and behavioral finance theory. the results showed that there is a non-linear and asymmetric dependent structure between china's real estate industry and banking industry. compared with the non-crisis period, the two industries' tail dependence is significantly increased during the financial crisis, so there is a risk of contagion. the results of the contagion channel research showed that liquidity and investor sentiment are the channels of risk contagion between china's real estate industry and banking industry while information association is not the channel of risk contagion between them. © 2021, editorial department of journal of northeastern university. all right reserved."

"different from prior studies that examined the impact of economic, demographic, and behavioral factors on homeownership, this paper adds to the literature by explaining homeownership from the confucian culture. based on the dataset of the 2011 china household finance survey, the results showed that a household head with more siblings was more likely to own a house, suggesting the interdependence within family members; when we divided the sample into male and female groups according to the gender of the household head, we found that the “sibling effect” only existed in male household heads, and both sisters and brothers contributed to the increase in the likelihood of owning a house, suggesting strong son preference. additionally, we found that the “sibling effect” mainly arose from household heads with low- and middle-income or those living in high sex-ratio regions, which further supported our arguments. finally, we analyzed the evolution of the interdependence within families in homeownership due to two important economic and demographic policies in china’s history: the reform and opening-up policy and the one-child policy. © 2020, springer science+business media, llc, part of springer nature."
"marketing and finance fields are attracting researchers to conduct studies that blend both disciplines., recently, behavioral science was added to the admixture so as to understand the attitude of a human being towards marketing activities and their effect on his/her financial decision-making process, leading to a different field of studies referred to as branding and behavioral finance. the purpose of this chapter is to understand the brand equity dimensions’ effect on an investor’s financial behavior, their role in his decision-making process and their subsequent impact on the investor’s final portfolio composition. this study augments existing literature and findings on this subject. it concludes that brand equity dimensions have an impact on investor behavior and intention to start an investment, and are taken into consideration when constructing a portfolio. © 2021, the author(s), under exclusive license to springer nature switzerland ag."
"online peer-to-peer (p2p) lending volume has rapidly increased in china because of high financing and investment demands. however, high borrowing default and fraud rates have negatively affected chinese online p2p lending because of its unique financial and undeveloped credit systems. they have prompted the chinese government to issue regulations on internet finance behavior to support online p2p lending. this research investigates online p2p lenders’ investment perceptions to understand investment intention related to online p2p lending. the research model is based on planned behavior theory. a questionnaire on attitudes collected data from voluntary participants; the data were analyzed with confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling. the findings show that lenders’ attitudes, behavioral controls, and subjective norms—and those three constructs’ antecedents, except relative advantages—have a positive and significant influence on lenders’ online p2p lending intentions. © 2021 portfolio management research. all rights reserved."
"crowdfunding is emerging as a significant means by which to finance and advance the 17 united nations sustainable development goals (sdgs). generating financial support for the sdgs is now of even more importance because of the economic impacts of covid-19. however, little research on sustainability crowdfunding has been conducted, particularly with respect to how behavioral influences, such as personality and subjective well-being, affect the willingness of individuals to financially support the different sdgs. to fill this gap, a theoretically comprehensive research model including the big five personality traits typology, value on sdgs, attachment to sustainability crowdfunding, subjective well-being, and three groups of sdgs was constructed and tested. results reveal that agreeableness has the highest effect on value on sdgs among five personalities, followed by openness and conscientiousness. unexpectedly, extraversion has a negative impact on value on sdgs and neuroticism has an insignificant effect on value on sdgs. value on sdgs has a great effect on attachment, followed by subjective well-being. attachment has the greatest effect on subjective well-being within this research model. comparing fair distribution, efficient allocation, and sustainable scale groups of sdgs shows substantial differences with respect to the hypotheses. © 2021 by the authors. licensee mdpi, basel, switzerland."
"we contribute to behavioral finance literature by demonstrating the relative superiority of a dynamic regime-sensitive approach in unraveling herding phenomenon. employing daily data in bursa malaysia from 1995 to 2016, we first apply two orthodox techniques: cross-sectional standard deviation of returns (cssd) model of christie and huang (2005) and the cross-sectional absolute dispersion (csad) model of chang et al. (2000). the ensuing results appear inconsistent, with only one model capturing herding. in contrast, the dynamic approach with a two-state markov switching model reveals that herding is a heavily regime-dependent and non-linear phenomenon. a deeper dive via sectoral decompositions shows that the financial sector and large- and mid-capitalization segments are more herding-prone. © 2021 elsevier b.v."
"this study investigates the mispricing of market-wide investor sentiment by exploring the relation between sentiment and investor expectations of future earnings. prior research argues that sentiment-driven mispricing should be most pronounced for hard-to-value firms, such as those reporting losses (baker and wurgler 2006). using investor expectations of future earnings, we provide empirical results consistent with this behavioral finance theory. we predict and find that investors perceive losses to be more (less) persistent during periods of low (high) sentiment; that (in contrast) investors perceive profit persistence to be lower (higher) during periods of low (high) sentiment; and that the effects appear stronger for loss firms relative to profit firms. we also document predictable cross-sectional variation within losses (with the mispricing mitigated for losses associated with activities expected to generate future benefits), r&d, growth, large negative special items, and severe financial distress. overall, our results document a new and important channel—investor expectations of future earnings—to explain sentiment-driven mispricing. © caaa"
"this paper proposes an investor sentiment index for the european market and tests its predictability power over returns and volatility. the constructed investor sentiment index for europe draws upon three well-established and two recent individual sentiment proxies through a novel dynamic factor modeling addressed to behavioral finance. the index is obtained through an extended period of analysis and validated with other sentiment index measures. the work relies on individual sentiment proxies based on a dynamic factor model and tests it using a tgarch model for volatility and returns. it carries out an in-sample and out-of-sample analysis to examine this sentiment index’s forecasting power over returns sustained on a recursive rolling window prediction against fama and french’s three-factor model. the findings demonstrate that the proposed index closely predicts stoxx600 variance and returns and confirms a strong spillover effect between european and us stock markets. this study also concludes that the proposed european sentiment index is a valid alternative method for investors to monitor and predict market behaviors. the developed sentiment measure is a vital market prediction movement tool for financial information providers, investors, bankers, and financial analysts. the research combines the sentiment index with a tgarch approach over the extended period of analysis and validates the method with other sentiment index measures. an in-sample and out-of-sample study confirms the predictive power of this work’s sentiment over returns compared to fama and french’s three-factor model. © the author(s) 2021"
"in criminology, compliance is a central focus of the deterrence and rational choice perspectives on crime. in turn, these perspectives have been guided by traditional microeconomics. behavioral economics, a recent branch of economics which pivots from and amplifies economic theories, has increasingly informed decision-making on a range of matters, including public health and finance. criminologists have begun to marshal behavioral economic insights to better understand decisions surrounding crime and transgression. prominent in behavioral economics are heuristics and biases in judgments under uncertainty. these involve shortcuts, rules of thumb, and other deviations from traditional economic norms, in how people navigate uncertainty. this chapter discusses how various biases and heuristics from behavioral economics research affect one of the most prominent decision-making constructs in criminology and compliance – perceptions about the likelihood of punishment for a contemplated transgression. © 2021 cambridge university press."

"we conduct a large scope field investigation of 19 major incidents in 19 large european insurance and banking institutions, based on 116 post-event interviews with managers and top executives over a two-year period. we demonstrate the power of the root cause analysis (rca) method for detecting human biases documented by the behavioral finance, the organizational behavior and occupational psychology literatures. these biases constitute key operational risk factors these organizations. we find that organizational biases (such as a breach of psychological contract) take center stage as root causes of incidents in these organizations. we also find that banks are more exposed to emotional biases (fear and greed) and insurance companies more subjected to cognitive conservatism as root cause biases. this research has direct implications regarding how banks and insurance companies may cope with regulations that put a greater emphasis on measuring and controlling operational risk and specifically misconduct risk. © 2021 elsevier b.v."
"in this paper, we provide an approach on using behavioral biometrics to perform cross-system high-assurance authentication of users in virtual reality (vr) environments. vr is currently being explored as a critical tool to ensure seamless delivery of essential services, such as education, healthcare, and personal finance, while enabling users to work from home environments. due to the sensitive nature of personal data generated, vr applications for essential services need to provide secure access. traditional pin or password-based credentials can be breached by malicious impostors, or be handed over by an intended user of a vr system to a confederate to assist the intended user in completing a task, e.g., an exam or a physical therapy routine. existing approaches that use the behavior of the user in vr as a biometric signature fail when users provide enrollment and use-time data on different vr systems. we use siamese neural networks to learn a distance function that characterizes the systematic differences between data provided across pairs of dissimilar vr systems. our approach provides average equal error rates (eers) ranging from 1.38% to 3.86% for authentication using a benchmark dataset that consists of 41 users performing a ball-throwing task with 3 vr systems-an oculus quest, an htc vive, and an htc vive cosmos. to compare to prior approaches in vr biometrics, we also obtain average accuracies for the task of identification, where given an input user's trajectory in a use-time vr system, we use siamese networks to return the user with the top matching trajectory in an enrollment vr system as the label. we report identification results ranging from 87.82% to 98.53% with average improvements of 29.78%±8.58% and 30.78%±3.68% over existing approaches that use generic distance matching and fully convolutional networks on the enrollment dataset respectively. © 2021 ieee."
"since investors have diverse risk motives for green investments, this paper uses data envelopment analysis (dea) and simulation to accurately evaluate the efficiency of green portfolios from the perspective of investors’ subjective risks and accordingly provide suitable investment selection strategies. on the one hand, the paper integrates investors’ risk preferences with efficiency evaluation models under the framework of behavioral finance, and then constructs a green portfolio efficiency evaluation model based on cumulative prospect theory on the basis of defining green portfolio efficiency. on the other hand, by bringing realistic chinese stock data into the evaluation model and solving it with the help of large number iteration and dea, the trends of frontier move-ments and selection options of green portfolios under the influence of different risk preferences are obtained and analyzed. the empirical simulation reveals that: (1) if investors’ risk aversion at return rises, it will not only reduce the expected prospective value of the green portfolio, but also shift down and flatten the frontier of the green portfolio; indicating that investors will tend to reduce their risk‐tolerant attitude and prefer a conservative strategy under the same value condition. (2) if investors increase their risk‐seeking in the case of losses, this will raise the expected prospect value of the green portfolio and lead to an inward and steeper green portfolio frontier; suggesting that, given equal value, investors prefer to increase their risk‐taking capacity and use aggressive strategies in the hope of turning the profit around. (3) the efficiency results of green portfolios are very sensitive to changes in investors’ risk preferences, suggesting that investors need to select and match green portfolios with their own risk appetite levels. the above findings enrich and expand the risk types and evaluation models in previous green investment studies from the perspective of inves-tors’ subjective risk. © 2021 by the authors. licensee mdpi, basel, switzerland."

"inverse reinforcement learning (irl) is the problem of learning the preferences of an agent from observing its behavior on a task. it inverts rl which focuses on learning an agent’s behavior on a task based on the reward signals received. irl is witnessing sustained attention due to promising applications in robotics, computer games, and finance, as well as in other sectors. methods for irl have, for the most part, focused on batch settings where the observed agent’s behavioral data has already been collected. however, the related problem of online irl—where observations are incrementally accrued, yet the real-time demands of the application often prohibit a full rerun of an irl method—has received significantly less attention. we introduce the first formal framework for online irl, called incremental irl (i2rl), which can serve as a common ground for online irl methods. we demonstrate the usefulness of this framework by casting existing online irl techniques into this framework. importantly, we present a new method that advances maximum entropy irl with hidden variables to the online setting. our analysis shows that the new method has monotonically improving performance with more demonstration data as well as probabilistically bounded error, both under full and partial observability. simulated and physical robot experiments in a multi-robot patrolling application situated in varied-sized worlds, which involves learning under high levels of occlusion, show a significantly improved performance of i2rl as compared to both batch irl and an online imitation learning method. © 2020, springer science+business media, llc, part of springer nature."

"in behavioral finance, collecting data on amounts and delays has helped research time preference. but, could other data support new conclusions about the discount dynamics? this paper considers only the physical aspects necessary to choose between payments sooner or later. so it is verified that personal wealth is one of the elements that influence the discount shape. specifically, when the impact of rewards on wealth is low, the dynamics can be simplified due to the low contrast between time averages, allowing different discount functions to be generalized by the q-exponential function. therefore, the wealth (or income) can be a relevant factor in individuals’ behavior because it influences intertemporal choice's dynamical aspects. © 2020 elsevier b.v."

"the study aimed to investigate the impact of behavioral biases on herding for islamic financial products with the mediation of shariah literacy. an adopted questionnaire from several published studies was used to collect data. the data were collected from 410 respondents and were analyzed with smartpls. the results for the direct impact showed that self-attribution, illusion of control, and information availability have a positive and significant impact on herding for islamic financial products while shariah literacy showed an insignificant impact on herding. the results for mediation showed that previously significant and positive impact turned to insignificant when shariah literacy was introduced as mediating variable between the illusion of control, self-attribution, information availability, and herding. from a theoretical perspective, this study would contribute to the existing body of knowledge of financial decision making from shariah literacy point-out. on the other hand, the findings of this study may be useful for investors to avoid herding in the islamic financial markets. the authors synthesize the contribution made by behavioral finance studies in extending the knowledge of herding behavior in islamic financial products with a mediating role of shariah literacy. the key limitation of the study includes data that were collected from three districts of punjab, pakistan. © copyright © 2021 din, mehmood, shahzad, ahmad, davidyants and abu-rumman."
"in china's capital market, the high idiosyncratic volatility portfolio has low expected return, and low idiosyncratic volatility portfolio has high expected return. based on the prospect theory, this paper proves that the reason of idiosyncratic volatility anomaly is that investors change from rational state to irrational state, and the proportion of irrational investors increases. increased arbitrage restriction and asymmetry make the proportion of irrational investors increase, and the anomaly of idiosyncratic volatility becomes more obvious. at the same time, this paper analyzes that high investor sentiment will aggravate the speculative psychology of the market, force the rational investors get out of the market, and make the stock price continue to overvalue, further enhance the arbitrage asymmetry, and the idiosyncratic volatility anomaly is more significant. this paper successfully explains idiosyncratic volatility anomaly in the framework of behavioral finance. high risk and low return are caused by irrational investors, arbitrage restrictions and high investor sentiment. the high risk and high return (risk-return ratio) appears in the profitable side, rational investors occupy the dominant position only exists. the occurrence of idiosyncratic volatility anomaly is thus conditional. therefore, this paper has made a theoretical contribution and provides an analytical framework for the explanation of idiosyncratic volatility anomaly in china's stock market. © 2021, tsinghua university press. all rights reserved."
"according to behavioral finance theory, investor sentiment generally exists in investors’ trading activities and influences financial market. in order to investigate the interaction between investor sentiment and stock market as well as financial industry, this study decomposed investor senti-ment, stock price index and sws index of financial industry into imf components at different scales by using bemd algorithm. moreover, the fluctuation characteristics of time series at different time scales were extracted, and the imf components were reconstructed into short-term high-frequency compo-nents, medium-term important event low-frequency components and long-term trend components. the short-term interaction between investor sentiment and shanghai composite index, shenzhen component index and financial industries represented by sws index was investigated based on the spillover index. the time difference correlation coefficient was employed to determine the medium-term and long-term correlation among variables. results demonstrate that investor sentiment has a strong correlation with shanghai composite index, shenzhen component index and different financial industries represented by sws index at the original scale, and the change of investor sentiment is mainly influ-enced by external market information. the interaction between most markets at the short-term scale is weaker than that at the original scale. investor sentiment is more significantly correlated with sws bond, sws diversified finance and shanghai composite index at the long-term scale than that at the medium-term scale. © 2021, science in china press. all rights reserved."

"under the framework of behavioral finance, the modeling idea of the sis epidemic model is used to study investors' behavioral contagion affecting the capital flow of the stock market. an index model of the stock market is established and stability of equilibrium is analyzed. the threshold theorem applicable to the stock market is obtained. this paper quantifies the behavioral contagion of investors by defining the investment infection rate and the investment removal rate. the model built on this basis can more accurately describe the behavior of investors in actual investment decision-making and its impact on stock indexes. both the theoretical research and empirical analysis indicate the rises and falls of the stock are consistent with changes in the proportion of the infection rate and the removal rate, revealing a clear positive correlation and the dominant nonlinear relationship. finally, the granger causality test is carried out, and the results show that investor behavioral contagion is the cause of the stock market's rise and fall changes. investor behavior contagion affects the stock price, but the stock price changes are not the cause of contagious changes in investor behavior.  © 2021 ieee."

"purpose: the concept of donation crowdfunding has been drawing enormous attention as it connects donors worldwide in a shorter time at a relatively lower cost. this paper aims to integrate two unified theories, namely, behavioral finance and unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model, to investigate on the motivators and deterrents that influence prospective donors to adopt and use donation crowdfunding. the study also substantiates the significance of donors’ behavioral biases through the moderating effect in the crowdfunding adoption process. design/methodology/approach: the study used survey method for data collection and the data set was obtained from the sample of respondents belonging to india and bangladesh. the proposed structural equation modeling is tested using spss 23.0 and amos 23.0. findings: the study reveals that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions and trust significantly enhance the intention to adopt donation crowdfunding. also, biases including overconfidence bias, herding bias and regret aversion bias are found to have significant moderating effects on the relationship between the behavioral intention to adopt donation crowdfunding and use behavior. practical implications: by investigating motivators and deterrents of the adoption of donation crowdfunding, the study renders lucrative insights for the donation crowdfunders in devising a donation fundraising campaign that motivates the prospective donors to provide financial contribution. originality/value: the study establishes its novelty in explaining the adoption behavior of donation crowdfunding with behavioral bias moderators as a theoretical paradigm. furthermore, the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model is extended by introducing, the variable “trust,” while studying the adoption behavior of donation crowdfunding. © 2021, emerald publishing limited."
"our study is the first to examine the pricing effect of u.s. trade policy uncertainty (tpu) on chinese stocks. we estimate the u.s. tpu beta, which measures chinese stock exposure to the u.s. tpu index. both portfolio analyses and cross-sectional regressions suggest a significantly negative relation between the u.s. tpu beta and expected returns, which cannot be explained by other pricing factors. the stocks in the lowest u.s. tpu beta quintile can generate 3.48% higher annual returns compared to stocks in the highest u.s. tpu beta quintile. furthermore, we provide two potential mechanisms that include a real economy channel and a behavioral finance channel using vector autoregression models. our results indicate that the negative premium can be explained by both demanding more of high tpu beta stocks in hedging against adverse effects from tpu and selling more of low tpu beta stocks due to pessimistic beliefs of noise trader. © world scientific publishing company"
"the aim of this paper is to review empirical studies that examined the factors influencing the adoption of islamic banking products and services with a view to making suggestions to the stakeholders in the islamic finance services industry (ifsi) in nigeria. the paper employed the literature review methodology to synthesize research findings in the study area. most of the studies reviewed showed that attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control positively and significantly influence the use of islamic banking products. others influencing factors include knowledge, awareness, compatibility, religiosity and perceived government support. the paper recommended that islamic banks in nigeria should develop robust marketing strategies that will boost the beliefs and attitudes of consumers of banking services, at the same time decreasing their perceived risks. in addition, they should increase customers’ awareness through effective communication, as well as develop low cost islamic financial products that will improve competitiveness. © 2021, the author(s), under exclusive license to springer nature switzerland ag."
"in mexico, according to data from the ministry of finance, 3 out of 5 businesses that are opened are run by women, in the same way it has been observed that in this country, the government has placed an emphasis on generating support programs for enterprising women. however, the failure rate of the enterprises is 75%. this forces to investigate the factors that determine the differences in the success of the enterprises between men and women. to do this, the behavioral and managerial factors that determine the impact on entrepreneurial success are analyzed, conducting an empirical study of 255 managers of recently created companies (from 0 to 3 years of opening) in four cities in northern mexico. using structural equations model, it was obtained that behavioral elements are entrepreneurship success determinants of women, that is, extraversion, openness and awareness. while for men, managerial skills are what determine their success. the previous results show the need to strengthen managerial training in women to achieve business success. © 2021, universidad del zulia. all rights reserved."
"the purpose of this paper is to empirically test the association of behavioral biases like overconfidence bias and self-attribution bias, and information acquisition with individual investors decisions. this study also extends its contributions in understanding the role of information acquisition in moderating the relationship of behavioral biases with investors decisions. smartpls 3.0 is used to analyze the structural equation model which is applied on the cross-sectional data collected from 390 individual investors of pakistan stock exchange using cluster sampling technique. findings of this study confirm that behavioral biases (overconfidence bias and self-attribution bias) distort the rationality of individual investors' decision, and information acquisition significantly moderates the relationship of overconfidence bias with investor decisions. this study contributes to the existing behavioral finance literature by unleashing less attended potential of information acquisition in managing irrationality caused by overconfidence bias. individual investors can use this study to better understand the adverse impact of behavioral biases as well as the usefulness of information acquisition in handling the irrationality resulted from overconfidence bias. the fruits of this study can be extended to the policy makers so that they can better steer their policies concerning the provision of information to the individual investors. authors attempt to combine the literature of behavioral finance and information acquisition with a notion to extend new theoretical understandings relating to investor decisions. © 2021. all rights reserved."
"in the last two years, ukraine and the world have been living in economic instability caused by the covid-19 pandemic, which has fundamentally changed the trends in global and domestic economies, public and local finance. this study aims to estimate the trends of economic development of ukrainian regions in the coronavirus crisis and their impact on the local budgets’ tax revenues generation. main findings show the impact of the covid-19 crisis on the development of ukrainian regions is territorially differentiated. it is determined that in quarantine restrictions, the regions were developing under the impact of behavioral and institutional factors. although a range of enterprises terminated their activities and there was a decline in income from business activities in 2020, the tax revenues of local budgets increased. the growth of tax revenues was accompanied by decreasing interbudgetary transfers and growing expenditures on containing the spread of pandemics and supporting healthcare. reduced transfers to local budgets from the public budget affected the funding of investment programs of regional development. the abovementioned effects of falling business activity and consumer expenditures of the population along with falling investment can be considered the delayed effects of economic activity curtailment in the short-term period. an intensive increase of public investment that stipulates projects co-funding from budget funds and resources of businesses and establishment of cooperation between public, regional, and local levels of government should become among the primary steps to overcome the negative trends. the author(s) 2021."

"purpose: a composite sentiment index (csi) from quantitative proxy sentiment indicators is likely to be a lag sentiment measure as it reflects only the information absorbed in the market. information theories and behavioral finance research suggest that market prices may not adjust to all the available information at a point in time. this study hypothesizes that the sentiment from the unincorporated information may provide possible market leads. thus, this paper aims to discuss a method to identify the un-incorporated qualitative sentiment from information unadjusted in the market price to test whether sentiment polarity from the information can impact stock returns. factoring market sentiment extracted from unincorporated information (residual sentiment or sentiment backlog) in csi is an essential step for developing an integrated sentiment index to explain deviation in asset prices from their intrinsic value. identifying the unincorporated sentiment also helps in text analytics to distinguish between current and future market sentiment. design/methodology/approach: initially, this study collects the news from various textual sources and runs the nvivo tool to compute the corpus data’s sentiment polarity. subsequently, using the predictability horizon technique, this paper mines the unincorporated component of the news’s sentiment polarity. this study regresses three months’ sentiment polarity (the current period and its lags for two months) on the nifty50 index of the national stock exchange of india. if the three-month lags are significant, it indicates that news sentiment from the three months is unabsorbed and is likely to impact the future nifty50 index. the sentiment is also conditionally tested for firm size, volatility and specific industry sector-dependence. this paper discusses the implications of the results. findings: based on information theories and empirical findings, the paper demonstrates that it is possible to identify unincorporated information and extract the sentiment polarity to predict future market direction. the sentiment polarity variables are significant for the current period and two-month lags. the magnitude of the sentiment polarity coefficient has decreased from the current period to lag one and lag two. this study finds that the unabsorbed component or backlog of news consisted of mainly negative market news or unconfirmed news of the previous period, as illustrated in tables 1 and 2 and figure 2. the findings on unadjusted news effects vary with firm size, volatility and sectoral indices as depicted in figures 3, 4, 5 and 6. originality/value: the related literature on sentiment index describes top-down/ bottom-up models using quantitative proxy sentiment indicators and natural language processing (nlp)/machine learning approaches to compute the sentiment from qualitative information to explain variance in market returns. nlp approaches use current period sentiment to understand market trends ignoring the unadjusted sentiment carried from the previous period. the underlying assumption here is that the market adjusts to all available information instantly, which is proved false in various empirical studies backed by information theories. the paper discusses a novel approach to identify and extract sentiment from unincorporated information, which is a critical sentiment measure for developing a holistic sentiment index, both in text analytics and in top-down quantitative models. practitioners may use the methodology in the algorithmic trading models and conduct stock market research. © 2021, emerald publishing limited."
"the basics of studying financial literacy are important for any generation. representatives of generation z, who were chosen as the target audience, are particularly in need of this knowledge today. we offer a training sprint game in the field of finance ""shock economy"" with elements of internal development. for the purity of the experiment, the game was tested on an optional course of studying finance for non-economists when forming an individual learning trajectory by students of the ural federal university (russia). the authors have developed a dynamic and exciting self-development game for reaction and adaptation to changes in the development of financial literacy. the basis of the game concept is the ability to adapt to new conditions and successfully respond to existing game rules, which implies modification, here and now in a limited time. the authors developed a flexible game model with illustrative elements, which were created using graphic editors. the advantage of the game is a steady concentration of attention on obtaining and consolidating the necessary competencies during training. although the target audience for the game being developed was generation z, for the completeness of the experiment, the authors conducted this game with students over 30 years old teachers and teaching and support staff. an experiment to study the behavioral characteristics of each group participating in game training showed that the proposed game may be of interest to the creators and moderators of game practices. since it is universal and can be adapted to different topics, depending on the requests, and can help in motivating learning. © the authors, 2021. all rights reserved."
"the sanctity of political speech is a key element of the u.s. constitution and a cornerstone of the american republic. when the supreme court linked political speech to campaign finance in its landmark buckley v. valeo (1976) decision, the modern era of campaign finance regulation was born. in practical terms, this decision meant that in order to pass constitutional muster, any laws limiting money in politics must be narrowly tailored and serve a compelling state interest. the lone state interest the court was willing to entertain was the mitigation of corruption. in order to reach this argument the court advanced a sophisticated behavioral model, one with key assumptions about how laws will affect voters' opinions and behavior. these assumptions have received surprisingly little attention in the literature. this book takes up the task of identifying and analyzing empirically the court's presumed links between campaign finance regulations and political opinions and behavior. in so doing, we rely on original survey data and experiments from 2009-2016 to openly confront the question of what happens when the supreme court is wrong, and when the foundation of over forty years of jurisprudence is simply not true. © oxford university press 2021. all rights reserved."
"the purpose of this study is to investigate the transformational leadership represented by its dimensions (idealized influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration) and its impact on the islamic banks' creative behavior in the kingdom of bahrain. since the study of debondt thaler, (1985) that introduced evidence on the effect of the cognitive biases on the stocks mispricing due to over/under reactions by the investors after receiving market related information, the behavioral finance has been involved in other financial research areas. hence, the research applied the descriptive-analytical method to answer the research questions and test its hypotheses. the research society included all employees of the islamic banks in the kingdom of bahrain. overall, 317 employees from the islamic banks in bahrain responded. the analysis was conducted using multiple and simple leaner regression to test the hypotheses. the results indicated a statistically significant effect of transformational leadership on creative behavior. the research has led to some recommendations, including increasing and developing managers' practices for ideal impact as one of the dimensions of transformational leadership through developing future vision capabilities, overcoming self-interest, and acting in a typical way that motivates employees to emulate them. it is also necessary for islamic banks to adopt and implement transformational leadership and all its dimensions, supporting their employees' creative behavior and developing their creative abilities.  © 2021 ieee."
"the aim of this study is to look at utility theory from a broad perspective. the main hypothesis in the theory of decision is that the person who is in the position of deciding is entitled to the “economic man.” also, the individual acts rationally. thus, utility is the ability to satisfy (eliminate) human needs of goods and services. utility is basically a psychological concept and also is the basis of economics and finance. three types of utility take place in the economics and finance literature: marginal utility, total utility, and average utility. in addition, two main approaches fall within utility comparison: cardinal utility theory and ordinal utility theory. furthermore, expected utility theory forms the basis of traditional finance. expected benefit theory assumes that people choose risky or uncertain opportunities by comparing the expected benefits from them. allais and ellsberg paradoxes criticize expected utility theory. tversky and kahneman (econometrica, 47: 263–291, 1979) present that the expected utility axioms are violated for more reasonable lottery alternatives than in the allais paradox and put a link between finance and psychology. the prospect theory of tversky and kahneman forms the basis of behavioral finance. © 2021, the author(s), under exclusive license to springer nature switzerland ag."
"purpose: this study aims to determine antecedents of market discipline. a model was constructed by extending the theory of planned behavior (tpb) to explore the cognitive, psychological and social factors that influence the market discipline in the form of withdrawal behavior. design/methodology/approach: this study applied a quantitative approach by surveying 181 indonesian retail investors in sharia mutual funds, which were represented by civil servants. the samples were collected using the purposive sampling technique. this study used the partial least square–structural equation model to analyze the data. findings: the results revealed that the islamic financial literacy, the attitudes toward withdrawal, the subjective norms and the perceived behavioral control had a positive significant effect on the withdrawal intention, whereas financial risk tolerance had an insignificant impact. then, all the exogenous variables and intention to withdraw had a significant contribution in explaining market discipline. contrary to the proposed hypothesis, the attitude toward withdrawal had a negative impact on market discipline. the structural model indicated that the tpb could be extended by adding some exogenous variables (i.e. islamic financial literacy and financial risk tolerance) in determining the intention to withdraw and withdrawal behavior, which indicated the market discipline in sharia mutual funds. research limitations/implications: this study was limited to individual investors who work as civil servants. this study did not accommodate different demographic factors such as age and gender, which influence fund withdrawal behavior. practical implications: the government must focus on the inclusion of market discipline in sharia mutual funds’ regulation to encourage the risk management disclosure, specifically that related to sharia compliance. originality/value: previous studies applied a traditional finance theory to predict market discipline, but this study contributes to filling the theoretical gap by explaining the market discipline from a behavioral finance perspective that was found in sharia mutual funds. © 2021, emerald publishing limited."

"egyptian investors have lost a large portion of their investment due to the coronavirus pandemic. this research is novel research that aims to identify the behavioral factors of egyptian investors that affect their investment decisions, before and after the pandemic. a number of survey questionnaires were distributed to egyptian investors, in addition to personal interviews. descriptive statistics and a regression model were used to analyzing the impact of psychological factors on the investment decisions for egyptian investors. results revealed that demographic and psychological factors influence investment decisions: overconfidence, loss, and regret aversion, disposition effect, representativeness and herding behavior, but it is not affected by gambler’s fallacy. it is affected also by some other demographic variables. however, income level has no effect. after the pandemic, not all demographic and psychological factors affect egyptian investor’s behaviour. the behaviour finance theory is valid only and applied before the pandemic. this research opens the door for a new dimension to studying how to work on the governance of investors’ decisions, rationalizing those decisions and their effectiveness, which ultimately contributes to achieving high returns on their investment portfolios. © 2021 the author."
"purpose: this study aims to propose a comprehensive education model to enhance islamic financial literacy to elevate the prominence of islamic finance. design/methodology/approach: the study conceptualized a framework of islamic finance education using prochaska and diclemente’s transtheoretical model (ttm) of change aided by a review of the essential literature on islamic financial literacy. the study also includes critical reflection based on the real firsthand experiences of delivering 16 voluntary non-formal community-based islamic finance workshops for indonesian diaspora in the uk and the republic of ireland from december 2014 to july 2016. findings: this study provides an inclusive conceptualization of an islamic finance education approach to creating awareness in communities of applying islamic financial principles in daily life. it also elaborates stage-appropriate strategies that cover the pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action and maintenance stages that vary by upon individuals based on their readiness to adopt islamic finance principles. research limitations/implications: this study is not merely based on a conceptual examination of literature but also incorporates critical reflection on a series of community-based islamic finance workshops conducted by the authors. it therefore offers the potential to present an under-researched model used to enhance islamic finance literacy as one of the pillars in supporting the development of the islamic economic and financial sector. practical implications: this study provides guidelines and various practical ideas that scholars and any concerned parties can use to offer community-based islamic finance educational activities aimed at supporting the future organic growth of islamic finance. originality/value: the study expands the use of prochaska and diclemente’s ttm (which has been widely cited in health-related behavioral research) and brings a unique theoretical lens, notably within the islamic finance literature. the use of the ttm was established in psychology and health-related behavioral science, particularly in relation to elucidating how people cease unhealthy behaviors (e.g. alcohol and smoking addictions) and how they develop healthy behaviors. this paper brings the ttm into another context on how to stimulate individuals, particularly muslims, to shift from “riba addiction” and develop sharia-compliant financial behaviors. © 2021, emerald publishing limited."
"purpose: this paper aims to examine the determinants of intention to adopt islamic microfinance among prospective customers in nigeria, to enhance access to formal financial services. design/methodology/approach: the quantitative study used the proportionate stratified random sampling technique to collect data from 450 respondents, using close-ended questionnaires. the data was analyzed using analysis of moment structures-structural equation modeling. the decomposed theory of planned behavior (dtpb) was used as the underlying theory to test 10 hypotheses. findings: results showed the intention toward the adoption of islamic microfinance is high in nigeria. in total, 8 of the 10 study hypotheses were supported, out of which attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control were found to have a positive and significant influence on the behavioral intention to adopt islamic microfinance. consequently, the study recommends the need for stakeholders in the nigerian financial system to embark on enlightenment campaigns that will improve the public attitude on the role of islamic microfinance banks in the promotion of financial inclusion and poverty reduction. research limitations/implications: the study focused specifically on three selected states in northern nigeria that are predominantly muslim. the findings and indeed the conclusions of the study, may not be suitable for generalization to other parts of the country. practical implications: the study found that three constructs: attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control were found to affect behavioral intention. thus, the central bank of nigeria and islamic financial institutions should tailor their enlightenment campaigns toward improving public attitude on the need to adopt islamic microfinance banks to further enhance financial inclusion, and thus reduce the incidence of poverty. islamic microfinance banks should complement their commercial products and services with islamic social finance products such as sadaqat, zakat and benevolent loan, as is the practice in jurisdictions where islamic finance is institutionalized. social implications: the social implication of the study is its ability to determine factors that will enhance financial inclusion in nigeria. this will assist in reducing poverty and income inequality. originality/value: the study was also able to extend the dtpb by introducing awareness as an additional latent construct in explaining attitude. © 2021, emerald publishing limited."
"china’s achievement of miraculous economic growth is a theoretical proposition that calls for an explanation. the key to understanding the logic of china’s economic reform is a rational explanation of the logical paradox between irregular local finance and the incentive compatibility of central and local governments. based on the fact that autonomous local financial resources have long been dependent on irregular fiscal revenue, this paper constructs an inclusive public financial system analysis framework from the dual perspectives of the central and local government. this analytical framework offers an explanation of the long-standing implicit fiscal decentralization contract in which irregular fiscal revenue is the carrier in the reform process, together with a description of the central-local interaction process and institutional space underlying the behavioral motivations of central finance tolerance and local financial autonomy. it demonstrates the logical consistency of irregular fiscal revenue, central and local incentive compatibility, economic growth and market-oriented reform. the inclusive public finance system, which takes into account both local dynamism and central control, provides the important institutional logic that has enabled china to reach the dual goals of economic growth and market-oriented reform. © 2021 social sciences in china press."
"the aim of this study is to explain behavioral portfolio theory in a theoretical way. the study starts with the definition of portfolio which is a financial asset that consists of various securities such as stocks and bonds and derivative products, held by a particular person or group. also, portfolio management is the management of securities according to investors’ returns and risk targets. there are two basic portfolio management theories in finance literature. the first is the traditional portfolio (simple diversification) approach based on the diversification of securities. the second is the modern portfolio theory, which is based on a more mathematical basis. modern portfolio theory mathematically shows the measurement of the risk and return of a portfolio of two or more securities and the determination of optimal portfolios. markowitz’s mean-variance model is the first mathematical explanation of the idea of diversifying investments and is the cornerstone of many risk models developed such as capital asset pricing model and arbitrage pricing model in later years. the empirical studies reveal that investors do not act rationally as financial models assume and anomalies occur. thus, behavioral finance tries to fill the gap in this area and states that investors should be considered “normal” rather than rational. prospect theory developed by kahneman and tversky (1979), brings psychological explanations to finance issues. mental accounting in behavioral finance prevents the rule of taking into account the correlation between the returns of an investment. also, herd behavior of investors distorts the efficiency of the markets and leads to volatility in financial markets. when investors show herd behavior, they do not care about the information received and tend to imitate other investor behavior. behavioral portfolio theory (bpt) emerged as a descriptive alternative to markowitz’s mean-variance portfolio theory. bpt connects two issues, the creation of portfolios and the design of securities. there are two versions of the bpt model: single mental accounting (bpt-sa) in which the portfolio is integrated into one mental accounting and multiple mental accounting (bpt-ma). © 2021, the author(s), under exclusive license to springer nature switzerland ag."
"since the magnitude of financial frauds grow rapidly with low clearance rates, detecting and avoiding frauds has been a tremendous challenge for financial institutions. both the detection performance and interpretability are critical for fraud detection to profile the fraudsters' modus operandi and to spot vulnerabilities of financial systems/processes. traditional rule-based approaches yield poor detection performances. recent machine learning methods basically generate recency, frequency, and temporal features to extract patterns from raw transaction data. on the other hand, this paper generates behavioral and (financial organization's) segmentation features based on financial expertise and characteristics solely belonging to (non)-fraudulent accounts. while inputting aforementioned features into different models and using accumulated features from past literature generate unstable prediction results, our features generate the best and stable results for the decision-tree-base approach like extreme gradient boosting and light gradient boosting machine. by using kolmogorov-smirnov test, we discover the instable predictive results are caused by vastly different distributions of features that reflects the fast-changing modus operandi in the training/testing sets. thus, generating training/testing sets by random sampling (compared to chronological separation) is improper for modeling time varying data. combining xgboost with our expertise-based features provides clear causal-effect between features and fraudulent labels for further interpretations. the high precision and recall rates allow banks to save screening labor costs and identify frauds without interfering with normal transactions. the quality of our features can be examined by showing that they occupy three out of the five most important features under the ranking procedure in a premium finance publication by butaru et al.

"behavioral economics: evidence, theory, and welfare provides an engaging and accessible introduction to the motivating questions, real-world evidence, theoretical models, and welfare implications of behavioral economics concepts. applications and examples - from household decisions, finance, public finance, labor, business, health, development, politics, education, energy, and sports - illustrate the broad relevance of behavioral economics for consumers, firms, markets, and policy makers alike. this textbook provides readers with both the intuition and analytical tools to apply behavioral economics concepts in understanding the complex social world. each part of the book covers a key concept, beginning with a range of empirical evidence that is anomalous within the standard economics framework. in light of this evidence, a second chapter introduces and applies a nonstandard behavioral modeling approach. the last chapter of each part explores market and policy responses to individuals behaving in nonstandard ways. numerous exercises of varying types and levels provide readers the opportunity to check and enrich their understanding. the book’s clear structure orients readers to the many concepts of behavioral economics. it also highlights the process by which economists evaluate evidence and disentangle theories with different social welfare implications. accessible to students from diverse economic backgrounds, this textbook is an ideal resource for courses on behavioral economics, experimental economics, and related areas. the accompanying solutions manual further extends learning and engagement. © 2022 brandon lehr."
"lending money is a major activity of the banking industry. principal borrowers pays interest to the bank along with the principal the depositor has borrowed. large number of non-performing assets (npas) are formed due to failure to repay the money. evaluation of the customers data for credit risk is an important field in risk management in finance. the decision whether the application is rejected or accepted is led by credit risk evaluation. many times loans are sanctioned without any background check because the firm has/had a good name in the market; thus lessening the scope of new small medium enterprises (smes) to get financial help. also most of the current systems consider only the financial aspects. our idea is to create a model which automatically calculates the credit worthiness of an applicant which not only considers the data directly provided by applicants but also extract insights from their behavioral and psychological trends of spending using clustering algorithms, classifiers,etc. © 2021 ieee"

"the field of behavioral finance has actively researched behavioral elements influencing the choices of individual investors. this study also contributes to the behavioral finance and examines the effect of an increase in a foreign firm's partial ownership in a domestic firm on the local individual investments in that domestic firm. specifically, using a controlled lab experiment the study examines the investments of pakistani individual investors between a purely pakistani firm and a pakistani firm with three different levels of chinese ownership (portfolio, minority, majority). the experimental results show that with reference to chinese minority ownership in a pakistani firm, the potential investors are 47% (61%) less likely to invest in a pakistani firm with chinese portfolio (majority) ownership than in a purely pakistani firm. the study uncovers an important non-monetary factor in the form of a foreign firm's partial ownership that can significantly influence the choices of individual investors. it also makes an important contribution to the growing literature on the chinese foreign investments specifically in pakistan by exploring how potential individual pakistani investors are likely to react to an increase in chinese investments in pakistani firms. ©2021 hamza umer, kashif ahmed, muhammad naumair jadoon."

"this paper investigates whether and how the research reports issued by securities companies affect stock returns from the perspective of investor sentiment in china. by collecting research reports and investor comments from a popular chinese investor community, i.e., east money, we derive two indices that represent the information contained in research reports: one is the attention of research reports and the other is the average stock rating given by research reports; then we develop an investor sentiment indicator using the machine learning method. based on behavioral finance theory, we hypothesize that research reports have a significant effect on stock returns and investor sentiment plays a mediating role in it. the empirical analysis results confirm the above hypotheses. specifically, the average stock rating given by research reports can better predict future stock returns, and investor sentiment plays a partial mediating role in the relationship between stock rating and stock returns. copyright © 2021 xiaohong shen et al."

"with the continuous development of behavioral finance, the impact of decision makers’ irrational behavior on investment has become a hot topic. this paper studies this problem from the perspective of overconfidence of both investors and managers. we incorporate both manager and investor into the framework of bounded rationality, and conduct an empirical study through a regression analysis of data from chinese listed companies over the 2009–2018 period, we find that (1) when the overconfidence behavior of investor and manager exists alone, it will significantly reduce the investment efficiency of corporate, (2) when the two coexist, it will also significantly reduce the investment efficiency of corporate, but the degree of reduction is lower than when the two act separately, (3) and we also find that stock price volatility plays a positive moderating role between investors’ overconfidence and investment efficiency, it shows that stock price volatility will amplify the adverse impact of investor overconfidence on investment efficiency of corporate. this paper also puts forward some measures to avoid and correct the cognitive bias of overconfidence. © 2021, the author(s), under exclusive license to springer nature switzerland ag."

"background: the rapidly growing aging population poses major challenges for health systems in vietnam. this study was therefore aimed to examine factors influencing the choices of healthcare facilities among older patients in vietnam, using a national survey on older people. methods: we applied multinomial logistic regression models based on andersen’s behavioral model with various predisposing factors, enabling factors and healthcare-needs factors associated with different types of healthcare facilities where older patients utilized services. data: we used data from the vietnam aging survey (vnas) in 2011. this was the first-ever nationally representative survey on older persons in vietnam. results: among those who used healthcare services, 15.1% visited central hospitals; 23.6% visited provincial hospitals; 28.0% visited district hospitals; 8.8% visited commune heath centres; 18.3% visited private hospitals/clinics; and 6.2% visited other facilities. the results showed that “having to pay cost” and “having sufficient income” were strong predictors for using commune health centres, district hospitals, and private facilities, while “having health insurance” was not a significant predictor for using these facilities. also, we showed that apart from enabling factors (such as age, gender, educational levels, employment status, living regionand place of residence), predisposing factor (such as health insurance, perceived sufficient income, household wealth and having to pay medical cost) as well as need factors (such as self-rated health and chronic disease) were also associated with the choice of healthcare facilities. conclusions: based on the findings, we discussed the implications of the results for organizing healthcare finance and delivery to achieve efficiency and equity for older people in vietnam. © the author(s) 2021."
"in emerging industries especially, extensive efforts have been made to promote “mass entrepreneurship and innovation” in china to dissolve the pressure of the “new normal” derived from economic growth and promote more adequate employment by higher quality means. the survival rate of chinese start-ups, however, shown by the global entrepreneurship monitor (gem) report, is below 5 percent. furthermore, the annual failure rate is twice as high as that of gem member countries. therefore, it is essential to study individual choice of entrepreneurship or the mechanism influencing employment. under these circumstances, this study can guide the entrepreneurial practice of new entrepreneurs in china and provide theoretical guidance for the improvement of china' s entrepreneurship policy. based on previous literature, this paper proposes a theoretical framework for entrepreneurial mosr (motivation, opportunity, skill, and risk), clarifies the key drivers for individual entrepreneurial decision making, and analyzes the four factors' internal mechanisms. moreover, this study constructs a mathematical model of whether an individual starts a business and analyzes the mechanism generating decision-making behavior between employee-to-entrepreneur and entrepreneur-to-employee. this research uses the gem database's adult population survey (aps) to conduct empirical analysis and study the mechanism influencing individual, entrepreneurial decision-making behavior. from the perspective of behavioral economics, the first part constructs the mosr theoretical framework of the individual entrepreneurship decision-making mechanism. this study proposes an entrepreneurial mosr model based on the mos model. we conclude that individuals will analyze positive utility obtained from entrepreneurial income, work autonomy, and entrepreneurial opportunities when choosing their career and weigh the disutility originating from entrepreneurial risk based on the expected utility theory. ultimately, the decision to start a business is made according to the expected total utility of entrepreneurial behavior. this paper notes that there is no exaggeration in entrepreneurial ability serving as the source of power to germinate entrepreneurial motivation of behavior agents, given that it is key to entrepreneurs seeking opportunities, creating value, and realizing entrepreneurial rent. meanwhile, entrepreneurship skills are the endogenous mechanisms of entrepreneurial decision-making behavior. that is, entrepreneurial skills affect perceptions of entrepreneurial opportunities and the acceptance of risks, and affect entrepreneurial income and job autonomy. therefore, this paper reveals the internal mechanism between the four factors of skills, opportunity, risk, and capacity, and puts forward the theoretical framework of the entrepreneurial decision-making mechanism. the second part analyzes the generation mechanism of entrepreneurial decision behavior based on mathematical and simulation analyses. early in their careers, it is likely that individuals choose to become employed due to their weak ability and lack of opportunities. nevertheless, the behavior agent will trade off entrepreneurship's positive and negative utility with increased age and ability improvement over time. if the positive utility of increased income, autonomy, and opportunities exceeds the negative utility of entrepreneurial risk, the individual may choose entrepreneurship. there is another possibility: the behavior agent may choose entrepreneurship early on because of resource and opportunity endowment. however, as time passes and age increases, the degree of marginal utility in entrepreneurship gradually leads to a decrease in entrepreneurship's positive utility. meanwhile, individuals seek employment instead of entrepreneurship. given the common path from employment to entrepreneurship in real life and the goal of current “ entrepreneurship and innovation ’ policy in china, this study further analyzes the behavioral characteristics of such entrepreneurs by simulation. it is estimated that individuals are encouraged to choose entrepreneurial behavior earlier; this is attributed to the positive utility generated by increased entrepreneurial income, caused by the accumulation of endogenous ability. this proves the entrepreneurial ability of the internal determining mechanism. the third part empirically analyzes the generation mechanism of entrepreneurial decision-making behavior and examines the mosr model of the entrepreneurial decision-making mechanism. considering different countries' heterogeneity, this study adopts the panel individual fixed-effect model for empirical testing. the baseline model's regression results validate the mosr theoretical framework. specifically, entrepreneurs choose behavior that has the capacity for high entrepreneurial ability, judging market trends accurately, capturing market opportunities, integrating resources efficiently, and avoiding and dissolving entrepreneurial risks reasonably. the regression results of the control variables reveal that individuals from non-innovation-driven countries show more entrepreneurial motivation. one explanation is that non-innovation-driven countries are equipped with more entrepreneurial opportunities as the economy develops. they encourage entrepreneurial behaviors and policies to reduce entrepreneurial risks to promote economic development. perceiving more entrepreneurial opportunities, individuals consequently have higher entrepreneurial willingness. this study conducts a robustness test by substituting the explained variables, alternating the regression model, and adding interaction terms; it shows that entrepreneurial ability can enhance individuals' perceived opportunities and entrepreneurial intentions, contribute to their avoiding dissolved risks, and alleviate the negative impact of risk and fear on individual entrepreneurial behavior, thus further confirming the rationality of the research proposition. the fourth part discusses the research conclusions and enlightenment. entrepreneurship is a process whereby entrepreneurs balance opportunities and resources to achieve their goals. therefore, the behavioral agent should strengthen the accumulation of entrepreneurial ability, cultivate team leadership, finance and marketing ability, update and accumulate knowledge in an active manner, and enhance theoretical learning and “learning by doing. ’ they should also explore the correlation between market demand and entrepreneurial resources, intensify the construction of social networks, recognize and assess entrepreneurial risks reasonably, and take active actions to mitigate them. compared with the first developed countries, china still lags behind in financial support, education training, research transfer, and business environment. first, the government should improve the guarantee and service of entrepreneurship and enhance individuals' motivation for entrepreneurship. second, entrepreneurship education and incentives should be strengthened, and individuals' entrepreneurial skills improved. third, it is strongly advocated that we should provide new entrepreneurs with reasonable entrepreneurial resource support, weaken their risk perception, so as to bear greater uncertainty. finally, we call for implementing “streamlined administration and delegated power’ establishment of an administrative power listing system, simplifying the business registration process, and reducing tax and administrative burden on new firms, thereby reducing entrepreneurs' costs of time and money. © 2021. all rights reserved."
"an event is a piece of news that triggers a change in stock prices. here, an event study is undertaken to capture the effect of abnormal returns due to an event. the event can affect the stock market in the long term or short term. event research is relevant to both the efficient market hypothesis and behavioral finance. in this study, we collected data from websites that manage financial and economic data, performed a sentiment analysis, and correlated news article data with changes in a particular company's stock prices in the stock market. data were collected from two well-known financial news websites. we observed a correlation between stock prices and news items. an event period of one day was considered for the study. the regression equation determined the relationship between stock returns and polarity and subjectivity. bayesian model averaging was performed to identify the effects of polarity and subjectivity on stock returns. time-series data were decomposed into components and detrended via regression. prominent keywords and their polarity values for a particular day were plotted. an event enhanced some stock returns while adversely affecting other stocks. we found a variation range of -400 to 200 for different company stocks for the selected period.  © 2013 ieee."
"this contribution develops the framework of a novel, socio-ecological finance system that enables the incentivization of environmentally friendly behavior, socially responsible production, resource recycling, sharing and more. we call this system finance 4.0—where finance 1.0 refers to a physical coin-based system, finance 2.0 to a fiat currency system, finance 3.0 to blockchain finance, while finance 4.0 stands for a multi-dimensional, real-time feedback system that combines blockchain technology with the internet of things. instead of “finance 4.0,” we will also often use the abbreviation “fin4.” in comparison with citizen scores such as the chinese social credit score, the fin4 approach is different in a variety of aspects: fin4 is not aimed at punishment and control, but rather at helping to encourage, empower and coordinate sustainable and other favorable action.it is being built for local, temporary measurements and feedback, not for global surveillance and control.it seeks to protect the privacy of people rather than to keep information about everyone and every action forever.it is not focused on the individual in the sense of profiling and targeting, but on favorable interactions and our social and environmental goals.it offers a multi-dimensional choice of options instead of trying to determine every individual’s action through behavioral manipulation and control.it has a participatory opt-in nature, where people can co-create the incentive system in such a way that they can reach their goals more successfully.with multi-dimensional incentivization, it becomes possible to advance several goals simultaneously; thereby, many more people can benefit from the interactions they engage in, as multi-dimensional value exchange increases the solution space enormously. © 2021, the author(s)."

"digital finance is assuming a significant part in the arrangement of financial services all over the world. fast growth with digitalization, data analysis, and computing capacities allows for a whole new scope of financial services and transactions. this financial development empowered by digital financial technology (fintech) has pulled in a ton of attention, as it could offer some potential for economic growth and development. as a part of the fintech environment, cryptography has started to grow quickly and digital assets are acquiring in favorability among financial bankers and investors. human behavior as they engage with financial activities is personally associated with the noticed market elements. however, with many existing theories and studies on the fundamental motivations of the conduct of people in financial frameworks, there is still restricted experimental derivation of the behavioral conduct of the financial agents from a definite market analysis. cryptocurrency technology has given a map to this analysis with its voluminous data and its transparency of financial transactions. it has empowered us to perform inference on the personal conduct standards of users in the market, which we analyze in the bitcoin and ethereum cryptocurrency markets. in our study, we initially decide different properties of the cryptography users by complex network analysis. financial cryptography is a difficult subject that necessitates abilities from a variety of seemingly unrelated fields. there is a serious risk that attempts to establish financial cryptography frameworks would simplify or omit key disciplines because they are caught between central banking and cryptography. this paper discusses research that attempts to limit the scope of financial cryptography. this model should assist the project, administrative, and requirements personnel by classifying each discipline into a seven-layer model of basic nature, where the link between each adjoining layer is evident. while this model is shown as effective, all models have cutoff points. this one does not present a design system or a protocol agenda. furthermore, given the model’s initial adaptation and the field, it should be viewed as a suggestion of complexity rather than a definitive approach. © 2021"
"this empirical research is aimed at testing the relationship of the big five personality traits namely openness to experience, extraversion, consciousness, agreeableness, neuroticism, and risk aversion with the investment intention of individual investors belonging to balochistan, pakistan. the primary data is collected through a self-administered questionnaire (a structured form that consists of a series of closed-ended and open-ended questions) from a sample of 397 active individual investors belonging to different districts of the province. the data is empirically analyzed by applying the partial least square (pls) path modeling technique by using the estimation package available in smart-pls. the findings of this study suggest that all the variables are statistically significant with investors’ investment intention with risk aversion as the strongest predictor. moreover, openness to experience, extraversion, consciousness, agreeableness, and risk are significantly and positively related to an investor’s investment intention, whereas neuroticism is negatively related to an investor’s investment intention. the results extended by this study can be used by financial planners and investment bankers to channelize the available financial resources in diversified portfolios. the results will help financial planners to make available diverse investment alternatives for investors in balochistan, thus catering to their unique needs. academia must offer courses on contemporary finance paradigm based on behavioral finance to enable future business graduates to make wise financial decisions. © copyright: the author(s) this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution non-commercial license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited."
"public safety personnel (psp) experience unique occupational stressors and suffer from high rates of mental health problems. the covid-19 pandemic has impacted virtually all aspects of human life around the world and has introduced additional occupational stressors for psp. the objective of this study was to explore how psp, especially those seeking digital mental health services, have been affected by the pandemic. our research unit, pspnet, provides internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy to psp in the canadian province of saskatchewan. when the pandemic spread to saskatchewan, pspnet began inquiring about the impact of the pandemic on prospective clients during the eligibility screening process. we used content analysis to analyze data from telephone screening interviews (n = 56) and descriptive statistics to analyze data from a questionnaire concerning the impacts of covid-19 (n = 41). the results showed that most psp reported facing several novel emotional challenges (e.g., social isolation, boredom, anger, and fear) and logistical challenges (e.g., related to childcare, finances, work, and access to mental healthcare). most participants indicated they felt at least somewhat afraid of contracting covid-19 but felt more afraid of their families contracting the virus than themselves. however, few participants reported severe challenges of any kind, and many (40%) indicated that they had not been significantly negatively impacted by the pandemic. overall, the results suggest that psp are not expressing significant concern at this time in meeting the novel challenges posed by covid-19. continued research will be required to monitor how diverse psp populations and treatment outcomes are affected by the pandemic as the situation evolves. © 2020 by the authors. licensee mdpi, basel, switzerland."
"while a company’s first-time, or inaugural, corporate credit rating should be highly informational, we are concerned that ratings agencies might be impacted by a lack of familiarity with newly rated firms. we examine this issue, finding that ratings agencies issue lower credit ratings for firms being rated for the very first time. we also find that this first-time under-rating moderates as time elapses, is lower for firms with higher financial leverage, and is less pronounced for larger companies, all of which are consistent with familiarity bias. we also examine the equity market impact, finding significant negative price performance surrounding inaugural credit ratings, quantifying the potential economic costs of familiarity bias. © 2020 the institute of behavioral finance."
"investor sentiment is a hot topic in behavioral finance. how to measure investor sentiment? is the influence of investor sentiment on the stock market symmetrical? that is all we need to think about. therefore, this paper firstly selects five emotional proxy variables and constructs an investor sentiment composite index by principal component analysis. secondly, the ms-var model is employed to study the dynamic relationship among investor sentiment, stock market returns, and volatility. using the model msih (2)-var (2), we found that the relationship among the investor sentiment, stock returns, and volatility is different in different regimes. the results of orthogonal cumulative impulse response analysis showed that the shock to investor sentiment has a significant impact on stock market returns, and this impact in the bullish stock market is significantly higher than in the bearish stock market. the impact of the shock to stock market returns on investor sentiment and stock market volatility is relatively significant. the shock to stock market volatility has significant effects on the stock market returns. overall, the influence of investor sentiment on the stock market is asymmetric; that is, in different regimes of the stock market, the impact of investor sentiment on the stock market is different. realizing this, investors can better understand and grasp the market, guiding their own investment behavior. other researchers can also further study the measurement of investor sentiment on this basis to better guide investors' behavior. © 2021 jiangshan hu et al."

"motivated by behavioral finance, we introduce multiple embedded financial time clocks. consistent with asset pricing theory in analyzing equity returns, the investors’ view is considered by introducing a behavioral subordinator. subordinating to the brownian motion process in the log-normal model results in a new log-price process whose parameter is as important as the mean and variance. we describe new distributions, demonstrating their use to model tail behavior. the models are applied to s&p 500 returns, treating the chicago board options exchange (cboe) volatility index (vix) as intrinsic-time change and cboe volatility-of-volatility index as the volatility subordinator. we find these volatility indexes fail as time-change subordinators. we employ a double subordinator model to explain the equity premium puzzle and the excess volatility puzzle. the results indicate the puzzles can be explained by fitting a double subordinator model to the historical data. © 2020 taylor & francis group, llc."
"it is essential to incorporate the impact of investor behavior when modeling the dynamics of asset returns. in this article, we reconcile behavioral finance and rational finance by incorporating investor behavior within the framework of dynamic asset pricing theory. to include the views of investors, we employ the method of subordination that has been proposed in the literature by including business (intrinsic, market) time. we define a mixed lévy subordinated model by adding a single subordinated lévy process to the well-known log-normal model, resulting in a new log-price process. we apply the proposed models to study the behavioral finance notion of “greed and fear” disposition from the perspective of rational dynamic asset pricing theory. the greedy or fearful disposition of option traders is studied using the shape of the probability weighting function. we then derive the implied probability weighting function for the fear and greed deposition of option traders in comparison to spot traders. our result shows the diminishing sensitivity of option traders. diminishing sensitivity results in option traders overweighting the probability of big losses in comparison to spot traders. © 2020 c.h.beck ohg. all rights reserved."
"this study is aimed at testing the relationship between investors’ uncertainty reflected by market sentiment and herding behavior phenomenon. using data for 1990–2019 for size-ranked portfolios, the evidence documented here indicates that herding is strongly related to market sentiment as captured by the cboe’s volatility index, the vix. the results indicate that the vix, which is also recognized as the fear index, has a substantial impact on herding across all groups and subgroups of size-ranked portfolios. overall, the effect of vix exists in most of the quantiles of the cross-sectional absolute deviation distribution. in this context, the scale and magnitude of the fear index impact rises toward the highest parts of the herding distribution. we also show that herding behavior is more pronounced when the market is overwhelmed by sentiment. the findings have several practical implications for investment professionals such as portfolio managers, investment officers, analysts, and other market participants. they also provide academic insights for researchers dealing with market efficiency and investors’ behavior. © 2020 the institute of behavioral finance."

"stochastic differential equations (sdes) rapidly become one of the most well-known formats in which to express such diverse mathematical models under uncertainty such as financial models, neural systems, behavioral and neural responses, human reactions and behaviors. they belong to the main methods to describe randomness of a dynamical model today. in a financial system, different kinds of sdes have been elaborated to model various financial assets. on the other hand, economists have conducted research on several empirical phenomena regarding the behaviour of individual investors, such as how their emotions and opinions influence their decisions. all those emotions and opinions are described by the word sentiment. in finance, stochastic changes might occur according to investors’ sentiment levels. in our study, we aim to represent the mutual effects between some financial process and investors’ sentiment with constructing a coupled system of non-autonomous sdes, evolving in time. these equations are hard to assess and solve. therefore, we express them in a simplified manner by discretization and multivariate adaptive regression splines (mars) model. mars is a strong method for flexible regression and classification with interactive variables. hereby, we treat time as another spatial variable. eventually, we present a modern application with real-world data. this study finishes with a conclusion and an outlook towards future studies. © 2020, springer science+business media, llc, part of springer nature."
"this paper develops a method informed by data and models to recover information about investor beliefs. our approach uses information embedded in forward-looking asset prices in conjunction with asset pricing models. we step back from presuming rational expectations and entertain potential belief distortions bounded by a statistical measure of discrepancy. additionally, our method allows for the direct use of sparse survey evidence to make these bounds more informative. within our framework, market-implied beliefs may differ from those implied by rational expectations due to behavioral/psychological biases of investors, ambiguity aversion, or omitted permanent components to valuation. formally, we represent evidence about investor beliefs using a nonlinear expectation function deduced using model-implied moment conditions and bounds on statistical divergence. we illustrate our method with a prototypical example from macro-finance using asset market data to infer belief restrictions for macroeconomic growth rates. © 2020 national academy of sciences. all rights reserved."
"it is known fact that passwords are no more suitable for security needs of twenty-first century world. it is possible to steal passwords, loose, and forget. anyone can misuse the password. as an alternative, nowadays, biometric devices are being used for identifying the people. biometric device uses the physical and behavioral characteristics of the people for identification. there are two types of biometric identifiers. one is physiological characteristics and the other is behavioral characteristics. biometric technology recognizes an individual based on fingerprints, signature, face, dna, typing rhythms, or iris. this provides secure and convenient authentication. these systems are in use across many areas like defense, government, finance, banking, consumer electronics, home safety, healthcare, etc. internet-based applications like online banking and other e-commerce applications are making biometric as the first and convenient choice. future scope of biometric in each and every aspect of life is limitless and it is aimed toward improved security and protection of data that is personal. the research in biometric has gained momentum as security needs are increasing for protection of personalised information. biometrics research is boosted further because of the interest shown in this technology by government, consumers, and other enterprises. multimodal biometric systems provide better security and convenience to the users compared to traditional methods of authentication. multimodal biometric systems enhance the accuracy of a recognition system as they consolidate evidences from different biometrics. multimodal system is a combination of face recognition, finger print verification, voice verification, or any other combination of biometrics. this takes the advantage of proficiency of individual thus overcoming the limitations of a single biometric. biometric systems are also vulnerable to attacks. there exists interesting and more specific attacks on several biometric systems. there are some attacks on methods used to index biometric data. there is a need to implement powerful biometric system. in this work, a novel framework of secured multimodal biometric system is proposed. © 2021, the editor(s) (if applicable) and the author(s), under exclusive license to springer nature singapore pte ltd."
"the tendency to overinvest in local assets, which is called “home bias,” has been an enigma fascinating economists for many years. this study challenges the effect of home bias and suggests that the high global branding of companies might have an equal or even stronger influence compared with the influence of location. using experimental methodology, the authors examine the effects of branding and location on the willingness of investors to invest in a certain asset. first, the results show that people prefer to invest in local compared with foreign assets. second, the authors find that the effect of location is stronger within low-branded companies, while in high-branded companies, the effect of location is not significant. third, the results show that people prefer to invest in high-branded companies than in low-branded companies and that the effect of branding is stronger within foreign companies, while the effect of branding is weaker within local companies. last, the effect of branding is as strong as the effect of location. © 2020 the institute of behavioral finance."
"this paper examines whether stock returns are consistent with the value function of prospect theory. we find that beta given a gain yields positive conditional premiums on returns while beta given a loss yields negative conditional premiums. this reflects the fact that the value function is concave for gains and convex for losses, implying risk-averse behavior for gains and risk-seeking behavior for losses respectively. furthermore, the absolute value of the premiums is greater for losses, which is in line with the value function being steeper in this state. these new findings provide indication that investors behave according to prospect theory. © 2020 the institute of behavioral finance."

"both traditional finance and modern behavioral finance consider that the volatility of the stock market comes from the release, dissemination and absorption of information from different views. with the rapid growth of chinese housing prices and the public’s attention to the issue, listed firms related to chinese real estate have come to represent one of the most important sectors in chinese stock markets. in this study, we quantify news articles using natural language processing techniques and investigate the impact of regulatory policies and firm-specific news on real estate stocks in this active market covered by a large amount of information. our three main findings are as follows: (1) the simple and effective quantitative measure of news emotion can be used to study the media-aware stock movements in the real estate sector of the chinese stock market; (2) policy news leaks ahead of time, which leads to abnormal fluctuations in the stock market 14 days before the release of information, while the stock market fluctuates only slightly and briefly after the news release; and (3) news pessimism indicates downward pressure on market prices, and optimism tends to increase market prices. news-sensitive stocks perform better than other stocks, with a sharpe ratio higher than 0.2. © 2019 taylor & francis group, llc."
"supported by the learning by giving foundation or other philanthropic sources, many college courses are allowing students to give away charitable grants to nonprofit organizations. in this article, the author shares the experience of a learning by giving economics of altruism class taught at an introductory level. the class is taught using best practices from service-learning, and its course design, curricular content, challenges, and outcomes are discussed. the class provides the unique opportunity to teach microeconomic principles to a diverse population of students while making a positive impact on the community. data show that student learning and overall experience with the service-learning exceed their initial expectations. increasingly, universities are offering classes that allow students to give away real philanthropic dollars. classes incorporating philanthropic grant-giving are found in a number of disciplines ranging from public policy and business to social work and philosophy. just like their counterpart courses in economics and finance that enable students to invest real money to maximize profit, these classes focus on effective investments that maximize social impact. an introductory course on the economics of altruism lends itself to this approach because the process of giving away money brings up many economic concepts, including utility maximization, allocation of resources, behavioral economics, social welfare, game theory, and measures of effective philanthropy. these topics appeal to today’s generation z (post-millennial) college students who are characterized by a community-centered, social-change mindset (grace and seemiller 2016; uche 2018). in the course, students actively engage with community organizations as they consider how to allocate a $10,000 grant from the learning by giving foundation. while such a course can easily be targeted to higher-level students, the following details how the learning by giving model has been incorporated into an introductory course on the economics of altruism. i offer a practical discussion of the course design, challenges, and outcomes of the course based on five years of experience. the class relies heavily on best practices in service-learning in order to impact learning outcomes. © 2021 taylor & francis group, llc."
"we extend the commonly-studied definition of investment in sustainable and energy efficient real estate beyond environmental building certification to include three additional types of environmentally-focused building interventions: environmentally-focused capital expenditure (capex); monitoring; and, tenant engagement. appealing to behavioral economics and finance theory, we test for a connection between changes in tenant and property management behavior and electricity consumption. through a partnership with a global institutional investment manager, this study examines ten years of asset-level operating statement and electricity consumption data in canadian and u.s. office buildings, measuring both the initial impact of such interventions as well as any adjustments observed over time. analysis of the proprietary intervention data allows us to better understand the impact of varied environmental interventions on the electricity consumption of commercial real estate. we find that all four intervention categories, including building certification, are associated with decreased electricity consumption, with tenant engagement providing an immediate decrease that is maintained over time. environmentally-focused capex is also associated with decreased electricity consumption in both canada and the u.s. taken together the results indicate that utility consumption and its associated costs are only minimized when multiple environmental interventions are implemented. © 2020 elsevier b.v."
"in this study, we examine the efficiency of the us stock markets during the covid-19 outbreak using a fundamental financial analysis approach, the constant growth model and a behavioral model including a google-based index. we juxtapose the released news and the performance of the us stock market during the covid-19 outbreak and we show that during some periods the health risk was significantly underestimated and/or ignored. the efficient market hypothesis (emh) suggests that prices incorporate all the available information at any point in time, yet as we show a systemic factor, the health risk, was not always rationally incorporated in stock prices. the runs-tests confirm our assumption that the market was not efficient during the examined period. the reason for this inefficiency could be that something is missing from traditional finance models, such as the impact of fear of covid-19. for this reason we employ a coronavirus fear index (cfi) based on google searches and using granger causality we provide empirical evidence that the fear drives the s&p500 performance, and using a garch model we show that the fear negatively influences the performance of the us stock market. © 2020 informa uk limited, trading as taylor & francis group."
"the impact of investor attention allocation shocks on firm-level stock return co-movements with the market remains of great interest. recent papers study this issue while showing that large national lottery jackpots act as shocks to investor attention. this paper contributes substantially to this stream of investigation. motivated by studies in behavioral finance, we frame the role of shocks to investor attention as either substituting for investor attention or reinforcing it, with co-movements between the stock-level and the market level either increasing or decreasing respectively. we identify, in contrast to other studies, an economically significant reinforcement effect for the chinese market. we find generally that large lottery jackpots increase, rather than decrease, allocation of investor attention to individual stocks, and, consequently, stock return co-movements with the market decrease rather than increase. an exception is the bear market of 1st january 2011–21st may 2014, where we find, as in earlier studies, jackpots associated with decreased attention. compared to recent work on national lotteries and investor-attention allocation, our findings suggest far more contextual nuance to this topic than previously acknowledged. our results should be of great interest to scholars interested in the impact of investor-attention allocation on financial markets, as well as to investment professionals. © 2020 elsevier inc."

"objective: we examine whether property assessed clean energy (pace) programs, an innovative financing mechanism using municipal bonds to finance the up-front cost of household energy conservation projects, reduced conventional energy purchases by residential customers and increased energy generated through residential solar panel and fuel cell installations. methods: using data on municipal bond issuances, electricity and natural gas purchases, and self-generated energy, we use a difference-in-differences design to estimate the effect of pace bonds issued in california between 2009 and 2017 on purchases and self-generation. results: we find more residential energy self-generation in counties with pace programs. results are inconclusive for conventional energy purchases, suggesting a possible rebound effect. conclusion: while innovative financing mechanisms facilitate access to otherwise prohibitively expensive technologies, governments must consider that behavioral responses may result in lower efficacy than desired and should consider pairing financing tools with instruments that concurrently promote reduced energy consumption. © 2021 by the southwestern social science association"
"we aim to advance our understanding of the adverse effects of extreme temperatures by examining the extent to which high temperatures affect stock market activity. we address this question by analyzing the trading volumes on the french stock market on days when the weather in paris is excessively hot over the period 1995–2019. our empirical analyses show that, on average, trading volumes fall significantly (between 4% and 10%) when maximum daily temperatures exceed 30 °c (86 °f). the observed negative association is remarkably robust to a battery of alternative analyses such as bin tests, event studies, and time-series regressions controlling for any seasonal effects and financial market conditions. from a theoretical perspective, this study contributes to the literature on behavioral finance by demonstrating the existence of a “hot weather” effect on financial markets. it also offers important managerial and public policy implications. © 2020"
"purpose: explain the causes of inefficiencies in asset pricing on the brazilian stock exchange through the behavioral finance hypothesis. originality/value: research made in the stock market over the last decades suggests that there is evidence of obtaining returns above the market average, through the purchase of undervalued assets, that is, when it has a low relation between the price and the fundamentals of the company. however, there is a notable discrepancy regarding the interpretation of causes among academics. the efficient markets hypothesis was presented, which is based on the premise of the strict rationality of economic agents. on the other hand, the behavioral finance theory was also discussed, which presents different assumptions. design/methodology/approach: using the historical quotes of the shares traded on b3, extracted from economática®'s database, the present work used the magic formula methodology to investigate the behavioral effect through the inefficiencies found in the pricing of these assets. findings: the results suggest that the brazilian stock market, in conformity with works of the same nature performed in markets in other countries, has inefficiencies in the pricing of assets, so that it is possible to obtain advantages from economic agents. the interpretation for the causes of such inefficiencies is based on the premises of behavioral finance, and points to the existence of a limitation in the rationalization of these agents. © 2020 mackenzie presbyterian university. all rights reserved."
"in this paper we adopt some ideas from quantum mechanics, and particularly the well-known schrödinger’s cat (1935) thought experiment in order to present some new views on the big question whether the markets are efficient or not. there are two main conflicting approaches in financial economics: the behavioral approach and the efficient market hypothesis (emh). the behavioral approach usually uses psychological theories in order to explain what the efficient market hypothesis (emh) cannot. however, behavioral finance does not have a specific model to suggest, and this is one major counterargument put forth by emh supporters. using the well-known cuba fund case as an example, we show that emh seems to be in superposition (simultaneously correct and incorrect), but suddenly collapses into one configuration. these dominant economics approaches are supplementary, so it is better for scholars that support either the emh or behavioral finance to incorporate their ideas into one model, than to continue debating the accuracy of the emh. the quantum approach enables us to distinguish the unexpectable from the irrational. adopting the quantum way of thinking we can build more accurate models and work toward the goal that most scholars pursue: to understand how the world works. © 2020 the institute of behavioral finance."

"a shift in perspective from standard finance to behavioral finance has taken place in the past two decades that explains how cognition and emotions are associated with financial decision making. this study aims to investigate the influence of various psychological factors on investment decision-making. the psychological factors that are investigated are differentiated into two aspects, cognitive and emotional aspects. from the cognitive aspect, we examine the influence of anchoring, representativeness, loss aversion, overconfidence, and optimism biases on investor decisions. meanwhile, from the emotional aspect, the influence of herding behavior on investment decisions is analyzed. a quantitative approach is used based on a survey method and a snowball sampling that result in 165 questionnaires from individual investors in yogyakarta. further, we use the one-sample t-test in testing all hypotheses. the research findings show that all of the variables, anchoring bias, representativeness bias, loss aversion bias, overconfidence bias, optimism bias, and herding behavior have a significant effect on investment decisions. this result emphasizes the influence of behavioral factors on investor’s decisions. it contributes to the existing literature in understanding the dynamics of investor’s behaviors and enhance the ability of investors in making more informed decision by reducing all potential biases. © this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution non-commercial license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited"
"in an effort to elucidate an aspirational vision for the food system and explore whether the characteristics of such a system inadvertently set unattainable standards for low-wealth rural communities, we applied discourse analysis to the following qualitative datasets: (1) interviews with food experts and advocates, (2) scholarly and grey literature, (3) industry websites, and (4) email exchanges between food advocates. the analysis revealed eight aspirational food system discourses: production, distribution, and infrastructure; healthy, organic, local food; behavioral health and education; sustainability; finance and investment; hunger relief; demand-side preferences; romanticized, community led transformations. study findings reveal that of eight discourses, only three encompass the experiences of low-wealth rural residents. this aspirational food system may aggravate the lack of autonomy and powerlessness already experienced by low-wealth rural groups, perpetuate a sense of failure by groups who will be unable to reach the aspirational food vision, silence discourses that might question those that play a role in the inequitable distribution of income while sanctioning discourses that focus on personal or community solutions, and leave out other policy-based solutions that address issues located within the food system. further research might explore how to draw attention to silenced discourses on the needs and preferences of low-wealth rural populations to ensure that the policies and programs promoted by food system experts mitigate poor diets caused by food insecurity. further research is needed to inform policies and programs to mitigate food insecurity in low-wealth rural populations. © 2020 by the authors. licensee mdpi, basel, switzerland."
"the initial purpose of the study is to search whether the market exhibits herd behavior or not by examining the crypto asset market in the context of behavioral finance. and the second purpose of the study is to measure whether the financial information stimulates the herd behavior or not. within this frame, the announcements of federal open market committee (fomc), governing council of european central bank (ecb) and policy board of bank of japan (boj) for interest change, and s&p 500, nikkei 225, ftse 100 and gold spot indices’ data were used. in the study, the analyses were made over 100 cryptocurrencies with the highest trading volume by the use of 2014:5 - 2019:12 period. for the analysis, the markov switching approach as well as loads of empiric models developed by chang et al.

"an extensive, in-depth study of risk factors seems to be of crucial importance in the research of the financial market in order to prevent (or reduce) the chance of developing this return. it represents market anomalies. this study confirms that the q-factors model is better than the other traditional asset pricing models in explaining individual stock return in the us over the 2000-2017 period. the main focus of data analysis is, on the use of models, to discover and understand the relationships between different factors of risk market anomaly. recently, fama and french presented a five-factor model that captures the size, value, profitability, and investment patterns in average stock market returns better than their three-factor model presented previously in 1993. this paper explores a shred of new empirical evidence to assess the asset pricing model through an extension of fama and french model and a report on applying bayesian network (bn) modeling to discover the relationships across different risk factor. furthermore, the induced bn was used to make inference taking into account sensibility and the application of bn tools has led to the discovery of several direct and indirect relationships between different parameters. for this reason, we introduce additional factors that are related to behavioral finance such as investor's sentiment to describe a behavior return, confidence index, and herding. it is worth noting that there is an interaction between these various factors, which implies that it is interesting to incorporate them into the model to give more effectiveness to the performance of the stock market return. moreover, the implemented bn was used to make inferences, i.e., to predict new scenarios when different information was introduced. © world scientific publishing co. and center for pacific basin business, economics and finance research"
"the aim of this study was to describe the consequences of being alienated from a child and to identify the coping strategies used by targeted parents to deal with the alienation. using a qualitative descriptive design, 54 self-referred targeted parents alienated from their children participated in an in-depth interview. narratives were analyzed through thematic analysis and commonalities in targeted parents’ consequences and coping strategies were identified. six subthemes emerged describing different consequences experienced by targeted parents due to parental alienation: emotional, behavioral, finances-work, cognitive, physical, and social. also, eight different types of coping strategies were identified and classified according to the activities reported by the targeted parents. parental alienation has serious consequences for targeted parents affecting various aspects of their lives. targeted parents need more understanding, support and orientation to cope with their experience. © 2020, springer science+business media, llc, part of springer nature."
"social media plays an increasingly important role in people's lives, transforming people from passive recipients to active creators of information and influencing all aspects of society in a unique way. behavioral finance studies have shown that stock investors are prone to making decisions that are not in line with expectations due to external emotions. this paper studies the impact of the sade incident on the economy of china and south korea, and studies and predicts the change of the overall stock prices in china and korea through the microblog emotions related to sade events. this paper uses text mining technologies to analyze the text of the related microblog of sade incident from july 2016 to may 2017 in sina weibo. the time series of emotional evaluation index and emotional tendency of blog posts are generated. based on var model and granger analysis, the correlation between the sse/kospi index and the emotional tendency is tested, and further the support vector machine model, optimized by the particle swarm optimization, is established to predict the price change of the stock market in china and south korea, and to analyze the influence of the sade event on china and korea. the experimental results show that the svm model achieves higher prediction accuracy after introducing the emotional feature. the accuracy of the forecast in south korea is especially significant, indicating that the impact of the sade event on the korean stock market is more severe than that in china.  © 2020 acm."
"objective: insulin access for people with diabetes is a growing public health concern and particularly important for people with type 1 diabetes (t1d) who depend on insulin for survival. however, few studies have examined the psychosocial contexts in which people with t1d confront, navigate, and attempt to resolve insulin access barriers (iabs). we conducted a qualitative study to: 1) describe factors affecting insulin access among adults with t1d, 2) characterize behavioral and emotional responses to iabs, and 3) understand the overall impact of iabs on the lives of adults with t1d. methods: we recruited a geographically and age diverse sample of u.s. adults with t1d (n = 21) from online diabetes support groups who self-identified as facing iabs. we conducted semi-structured phone interviews lasting 45–60 min between april and october 2017. we followed an inductive coding approach to identify concepts and themes related to participants' experiences with iabs. findings: participants conceptualized the experience of being without insulin as a “life or death” emergency, which significantly influenced their subsequent behavioral and emotional responses to compromised insulin access. participants also described multiple iabs including unaffordable health care, institutional unresponsiveness, and major life transitions. unable to consistently depend on the u.s. healthcare system to address their insulin needs, participants described taking strategic actions to maximize their existing insulin supplies, obtain more insulin, and create long-term security against future iabs. these strategies were not always successful and often negatively impacted participants’ health, finances, careers, relationships, and future opportunities. conclusions: disruptions in insulin access or the threat of future disruption, a concept we term “insulin insecurity,” is a barrier to health and well-being among people with t1d. our findings suggest the u.s. healthcare system is ill-equipped to address insulin needs among adults with t1d. © 2020 the authors"
"we explain main concepts of behavioral finance within the framework of the rational dynamic asset pricing theory (rdapt). we discuss key modifications of the cumulative prospect theory (pt) weighting function to preserve key characteristics of the price process essential for deducting derivatives pricing. we then move to value-function and provide an overview of how it relates to optimality in the framework of the rational finance theory common risk and return measures such as var, conditional var, range-value-at-risk, and other related risk functions. we provide guidelines regarding how those theoretical results could be implemented and used in practice. ultimately, the chapter bridges the gap between rational and behavioral finance by introducing both a consistent weighting function and value-function maximization criteria based on rational-finance accepted risk and return measures. although the main motivation of the chapter has been inspired by wealth management applications, the results certainly have broader applications for both active and passive managers, such as market sentiment extraction, novel designs of quantitative strategies, as well as behavior-flavor design of etfs and smart-beta funds. © 2020 world scientific publishing company."
"purpose: the gradual implementation of blockchain technology in peer-to-peer (p2p) lending platforms facilitates safer, transparent and quick access to funds without having to deal with the more complex and costly processes of banks. beyond that, the purpose of this paper is to examine trust-enhancing heuristics that show a need for blockchain to assist in monitoring and bad loan recovery. design/methodology/approach: this study examines 909 lending decisions by 303 finance students on a mock p2p site. each participant was asked to make three lending decisions. the loan applications were identical with the exception of a female or male photo (vs an icon) and reports of having raised half the loan in either 2 or 11 days (vs 7). findings: investors who have experienced financial trauma are more likely to herd and lend higher amounts to loan applicants that are highly trusted by other lenders. this effect is more pronounced for male investors lending to highly trusted female loan applicants. practical implications: blockchain can compensate for behavioral biases and improve monitoring by helping track digital money transactions and assisting in bad loan recovery efforts. originality/value: this study is the first behavioral experiment to examine herding in p2p lending. the findings complement and corroborate those by gonzalez and komarova (2014, 2015) and emphasize the need for blockchain to assist beyond trusted records and safe transfers of funds. © 2019, emerald publishing limited."

"purpose: over the last ten years (2010–2019), the amount of nonperforming loans (npls) has been more than tripled in the banking industry of bangladesh. thus, this paper explores the behavioral dimensions, which contribute to the npls. design/methodology/approach: by analyzing social, cultural, psychological, political, economic, internal control mechanism and law enforcement contexts of bangladesh, this study identifies nepotism (ne), moral hazard (mh), inadequate collateral (ic), poor credit assessment (ca), lack of proper monitoring (lpm), repayment flexibility (rf), business risk (br) and lending interest rate (lir) as the catalysts of raising npls. next, a structured questionnaire survey has been performed in bangladesh among bank officials who closely work in credit risk management, credit supervision, corporate finance and loan recovery department. finally, partial least squares (pls) path modeling, a variance-based technique of structural equation modeling, is used in this study as a statistical tool to analyze the data. findings: this study finds that moral hazard problem, lack of proper monitoring, inadequate collateral and nepotism have significant positive impact on the raising of npls. unfortunately, this study does not find any statistical significance of poor credit assessment, business risk and repayment flexibility on the npls in bangladesh. finally, this study reveals that lending interest rate has significant positive impact on the npls. hence, this study concludes that domestic lending interest rate is not lower enough, and so this double-digit interest rate affects negatively to loan repayment. research limitations/implications: this study concludes that moral hazard problem of borrower, lack of board independence, lack of proper monitoring, form and extent of collateral, management lobbying, indecorous personal guarantee by management, dependent-independent directors and nepotism are extensively contributing for occurring npls in bangladesh. these noninstitutionalized stimulators should adequately be scrutinized by regulatory bodies, policy makers and banks. besides, lir needs to be decreased in a convenient level for mitigating npls. originality/value: this study is the empirical evidence of behavioral dimensions related with the growth of npls in bangladesh by taking direct response from knowledgeable bankers. © 2020, ratan ghosh, kanon kumar sen and farzana riva."
"purpose: the purpose of this paper is to investigate the emergence of blockchain to determine its feasibility for electronic transfer payments. an integrated conceptual framework is developed for blockchain electronic transfer. the three “markers” of classic money (store of value, medium of exchange and unit of account and efficiency) are assessed in the case of blockchain technology. a survey is also conducted among the executives of financial vs manufacturing sectors with respect to five major variables for the emerging distributed financial data based on blockchain. design/methodology/approach: conducting a literature review and using prior knowledge from the works of those well-versed and knowledgeable in the field. this research is also supported by collecting and analyzing the results of a behavioral survey of the executives in two different industries. findings: blockchain technology has the potential to have widespread change in how firms operate and implement a new method for electronic payments transfer through cryptocurrencies. although the community for blockchain technology is deregulated and has drawbacks, it is expected that the limitations will gradually be mitigated through its growth. the results of the behavioral survey show that there are significant differences between the expectations/perceptions of participants in the sectors of finance vs manufacturing. namely, the knowledge/awareness of participants about blockchain, the value-added convenience for end users, and participants’ willingness to embracing and accepting new applications are significantly different between the two sectors. originality/value: the reach and applications for blockchain are not limited to business or any particular sector. blockchain technology may contribute to the operations of different types of organizations and industry sectors. since the perception of participants about blockchain is different between selected industries, this research suggests the need for more education and building awareness among the participants in different sectors of the economy. © 2019, emerald publishing limited."

"the advent of distributed ledger technology in developed nations is emerging as a new instrument to improve the traditional industry system in the developing states. the adoption of disruptive technology is indeed a necessary condition for the coming future to bring transparency and remove third party trust related issues in the industries. the aim of the current study is to understand the distributed ledger technology (dlt) adoption by service manufacturing industries-pakistan context. the conceptual model is based on the traditional adoption theories-namely theory of planned behavior (tpb), technology acceptance model (tam) and technology readiness index (tri). in order to analyze the data a partial least square structural equation modeling (pls-sem) is used and empirical data is collected from a sample of 211 practitioners working in the finance, supply chain and it departments. the study result shows that tri construct-optimism (opt) and innovativeness (inn) have significant impact on perceived ease of use (peou) and insignificant impact on perceived usefulness (pu). tam construct- perceived ease of use (peou), perceived usefulness (pu), attitude (att) and tpb-construct perceived behavioral control (bpc) affect the behavioral intention (bi). tpb construct-subjective norms (sn) have negligible impact on the behavioral intention (bi). it is one of the initial studies on blockchain technology implementation for pakistan industries and the result suggest that practitioners would perceive blockchain technology adoption free of efforts to arise the maximum benefits for improving the productions efficiency. © 2020 ieee."
"purpose: the purpose of this paper is to investigate the factors influencing quick cash by crowd in agri-food crowdfunding campaigns; this paper utilizes prospect theory to analyze the value and weighting functions of the crowd's cash. design/methodology/approach: using samples of crowdfunding campaigns launched in the zhongchou (www.zhongchou.cn) platform's agriculture and food category, this paper employs a multivariate linear regression model to investigate factors that motivate the crowd to make quick investment decisions. findings: the results demonstrate that lowering the investment threshold, improving publicity, and increasing the benefits of a campaign can increase the decision weight assigned to a campaign, thereby motivating the crowd to make quick investment decisions. improving the product's reputation, enhancing campaign promotion, and diversifying the reward scheme can increase the crowd's expected value of the campaign – another motivation for a quicker cash decision. practical implications: this paper can help initiators, platforms and regulators better fulfil their roles in promoting the rapid, healthy development of crowdfunding in the agri-food industry, especially in the context of the chinese launch of significant initiatives to develop crowdfunding aimed at rural e-commerce and poverty alleviation. originality/value: this paper extends the behavioral finance concept of prospect theory to agri-food crowdfunding campaigns and investigates factors that motivate the crowd to make quick investment decisions. additionally, this paper demonstrates that the backers of crowdfunding are not perfectly rational and can be motivated to invest by increasing mean decision weight and expected value of a campaign. © 2020, emerald publishing limited."
"the representative heuristic and overconfidence are cognitive biases that influence the decisions of the investors in the stock market. overconfident investors tend to rely on representative heuristic for decision making under uncertainty. investors overestimate their knowledge and think that past performance is the best indicator to measure the future performance of a company. investors who are overconfident and use representative heuristics overreact to any new information that arrives in the market, and it affects their decisions. to measure the presence of overconfidence and representative heuristic in decisions making of investors trading at pakistan stock exchange (psx), we have used primary as well as stock market secondary data. primary data was collected from 446 retail investors, and secondary data was collected from 301 companies listed in 35 sectors of psx. we have found a significant effect of overconfidence and representative heuristic on the decision making of investors and the trade volume of the stock market. this paper adds to the literature of behavioral finance concerning the role of overconfidence as a mediator between representative heuristic and investment decisions. the evidence documented in this paper is first known to measure the role of mediator between representative heuristic and investment decisions. © 2020 borsa ä°stanbul anonim åžirketi"

"fintech (financial technology) and blockchain are prevalent topics among technology leaders in finance today. this article describes the impact and revolution of fintech and blockchain in the financial industry and demonstrates the main characteristics of such technology. then, we present three critical challenges as well as three ethical issues about using blockchain technology. next, we discuss the development of blockchain for the financial sector. in addition, we describe the real motivations for banks to explore blockchain, and problems they face. in order to have a good understanding of the industry, a qualitative method was adopted, and sixteen experts were interviewed. it was identified that knowledge hiding in blockchain was common and the rationale behind was analyzed using the tpb (theory of planned behavior) approach. the analysis results suggested that knowledge hiding was due to affective, behavioral and cognitive evaluations. the interviewees also provided several recommendations and success factors to overcome current issues in blockchain adoption. therefore, four important propositions have been developed. finally, this article suggests how financial services should respond to this new technology and how to manage knowledge sharing in a more structured way. this article contributes to the literature related to the current entrepreneurial finance landscape for blockchain. © 2020 elsevier inc."
"purpose: the purpose of this paper is to determine whether individual investor sentiment and its factors influence investment decision-making behavior in the indian stock market. the study contributes to the novel conceptual framework that integrates the impact of investor sentiment and outlines the role of its factors (herding, media factor, advocate recommendation and social interaction) during the investment decision-making process. design/methodology/approach: in this paper, data were collected using a structured questionnaire survey from indian individual investors. it uses self-reported sources of information collected via a survey of individual investors and estimated the linkage via path modeling. the collected data were analyzed using partial least square structural equation modeling to examine the relationship between the construct, namely, herding, media, advocate recommendation and social interaction with investor sentiment and investment decision-making. findings: the study shows that herding, media factor, advocate recommendation and social interaction significantly and positively influence the investor sentiment. among all the factors, social interaction has the lowest influence on investor sentiment. the study also reveals that investor sentiment has a positive impact on investment decision-making. practical implications: the study provides valuable insights for the individual investors, financial advisors, policymakers and other stakeholders. knowledge of behavioral finance would enhance the decision-making capabilities of individual investors in the stock market. thus, the study calls for the need to increase awareness among indian investors about behavioral finance and its usefulness in investment decision-making. the paper also sheds light upon the influence of investor sentiment and its antecedents on investment decision-making. the study confirms that the investor relies on their sentiment while making investment decisions. hence, the stakeholders in the stock market should focus on investor sentiment and other psychological aspects of individual investors as well. originality/value: there are very few studies that deal with the behavioral aspects of individual investors in an emerging market context. the study mainly focuses on the antecedent of investor sentiment and its influence on investment decision-making in the indian stock market. to the best of authors’ knowledge, the present study unique nature that examines the impact of the antecedent of investor sentiment which was not explored in the indian context and investment decision-making of individual investors. © 2020, emerald publishing limited."
"this paper studies the optimal investment problem for a behavioral investor with probability distortion functions and an s-shaped utility function whose utility on gains satisfies the inada condition at infinity, albeit not necessarily at zero, in a complete continuous-time financial market model. in particular, a piecewise utility function with hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (hara) is applied. the considered behavioral framework, cumulative prospect theory (cpt), was originally introduced by [a. tversky & d. kahneman (1992) advances in prospect theory: cumulative representation of uncertainty, journal of risk and uncertainty 5 (4), 297-323]. the utility model allows for increasing, constant or decreasing relative risk aversion. the continuous-time portfolio selection problem under the s-shaped hara utility function in combination with probability distortion functions on gains and losses is solved theoretically for the first time, the optimal terminal wealth and its replicating wealth process and investment strategy are stated. in addition, conditions on the utility and the probability distortion functions for well-posedness and closed-form solutions are provided. a specific probability distortion function family is presented which fulfills all those requirements. this generalizes the work by [h. jin & x. y. zhou (2008) behavioral portfolio selection in continuous time, mathematical finance 18 (3), 385-426]. finally, a numerical case study is carried out to illustrate the impact of the utility function and the probability distortion functions.  © 2020 world scientific publishing company."
"based on the combination of standard financial theory and behavioral finance theory, it tries to describe the inducing factors and the driving process of fund inflow in the stock market. we establish a fund inflow concept model of the stock market with three hypotheses as market investment value channel, behavior channel and compound channel. monetary environment, market yield, market volatility and investor sentiment are set to be independent variable in the model, as well as market investment value and overconfidence of the investors are set to be intermediate variables in the concept model. using 149 groups of chinese stock market weekly data from july 2014 to june 2017, an empirical research is made to by establishing var model. through var model and granger causality test, the empirical results show that the compound channel hypothesis is established, the behavior channel hypothesis is partially established, and the value channel hypothesis is not established. it is also found that there exists a positive feedback loop in the behavior channel, as well as a self-correction mechanism in the compound channel. the research reveals the influencing factors system and its implementation path of the stock market fund inflow, which also gives evidence of chinese stock market characteristics as fund-driven instead of value-driven. © 2020 ieee."
"this article presents a systematic literature review on residential property investor types in selected social science disciplines and critically evaluates the status quo of academic engagement within this diverse group of property market actors. a recurring critique in recent years has been the minimal acknowledgment of investor heterogeneity particularly in relation to urban development and the financialization of housing. yet, to date, there is no systematic evidence supporting these contentions. therefore, we conducted an exhaustive literature review of residential investment landscapes through the web of science citation database in the following fields: urban and regional planning, geography, sociology, urban studies, public administration, and economics. subsequently, we methodically searched for the types of investors addressed, and investor categories employed, in journal articles published between 2000 and 2019. following a meta-categorization of the results, we demonstrate how existing literature differentiates investors in terms of their spatial scale of operation, size and social composition, investment object and finance, or investment and social behavior. additionally, we highlight the key topics and issues addressed in the reviewed literature within each meta-category. we propose to turn the four meta-categories into a multidimensional analytical framework as a point of departure for a more nuanced and in-depth understanding of investor differentiations, a tool that is urgently needed in planning studies and related disciplines. furthermore, we argue that mixed method approaches combining hard and quantifiable with soft behavioral investor characteristics, as well as institutional analyses combining structural considerations with actors’ agency, are indispensable to disentangle contemporary residential property market dynamics. © the author(s) 2020."

"introduction. the article is devoted to the issues of multidisciplinary interaction in new scientific fields, which involve a wide variety of convergences, no matter how strange at first glance they may seem. one of these phenomena is the interaction of psycholinguistics and neuroeconomics. the goal. the article examines the transition of modern science to multidisciplinary discourse, which makes it necessary to conceptualize and possibly operationalize methods of psycholinguistics. the conceptualization of new areas of neuroeconomics, in a psycholinguistic context, presupposes a certain mental experience that includes, in addition to the processes of creating new concepts and contextual economic knowledge, also defining the role of interests, intentions, emotions in human economic activity. methods. multivariate analysis, comparative analysis, extrapolation. results. it is proved that in recent decades the development of new areas of economic science, namely those related to the development of neuroeconomics, has significantly expanded the field of psycholinguistics. the production of new paradigms of economic theory, the formation of the corresponding definitions, objects requires the design and definition of them both in form and in content. it considers the need for a theoretical and orderly definition of the functional meaning of the psycholinguistic context of new definitions, the result of which can be a conceptual system for communication between specialists in various fields of science at the level of their professional understanding. it seems that the central issues in the psycholinguistic discourse of neuroeconomics have become the relationship between economics, psychology, linguistics and psycholinguistics. such connection is undoubtedly of a multidisciplinary nature, which contributes to the deepening of the relationship between scientific thought, culture and language and became the impetus for understanding the nature of human cognition at a higher, multidisciplinary level of development of science. this is a necessary component for understanding the meanings and structure of concepts, terms and definitions, as well as communications at a higher scientific level. conclusions. it is concluded that new areas of neuroeconomics such as behavioral economics, behavioral finance, emotional economics, psychological economics, have become areas of economic theory that, explicitly or implicitly, take into account the psychological characteristics of human perception and behavior in the process of economic activity. these definitions catalyze the theoretical integration of various scientific fields, and, above all, psycholinguistic science. © tkach tamara, tkach anatoliy & rekun ivan."
"purpose: research in the area of behavioral finance has demonstrated that investors exhibit irrational behavior while making investment decisions. investor behavior usually deviates from logic and reason, and consequently, investors exhibit various behavioral biases which impact their investment decisions. the purpose of this paper is to rank the behavioral biases influencing the investment decision making of individual equity investors from the state of punjab, india. this research would provide valuable insight into the different behavioral biases to investors and other participants of the capital market and help them in improving investment decisions. design/methodology/approach: the research is conducted on the individual equity investors of punjab, india. fuzzy analytic hierarchy process was applied to rank the factors influencing the decision making of individual equity investors of punjab. the primary factors considered for the study are overconfidence bias, representative bias, anchoring bias, availability bias, regret aversion bias, loss aversion bias, mental accounting bias and herding bias. findings: the three most influential criteria were herding bias, loss aversion bias and overconfidence bias. the five most influential sub-criteria were “i readily sell shares that have increased in value (c61),” “news about the company (newspapers, tv and magazines) affects my investment decision (c84),” “i invest each element of my investment portfolio separately (c71)” and “i usually hold loosing stock for long time, expecting trend reversal (c52).” research limitations/implications: although sample survey conducted in the present study was based on a limited sample selected from a particular area that truly represented the total population, it is considered as the limitation of this study. practical implications: the outcome of this research provides investors with a better understanding of behavioral biases that influence their decision making. this study provides them a guideline on different behavioral biases that they should consider while making investment decisions. originality/value: the research model is based on the available literature on behavioral finance and the research results and findings would add value to the existing knowledge base. © 2019, emerald publishing limited."

"purpose: the purpose of this paper is to depict how the author's way from standard finance to the first and second generations of behavioral finance illustrates the ongoing general transition. design/methodology/approach: the first generation, starting in the early 1980s, largely accepted standard finance's notion of people's wants as “rational” wants – restricted to the utilitarian benefits of high returns and low risk. that first generation commonly described people as “irrational” – succumbing to cognitive and emotional errors and misled on their way to their rational wants. the second generation describes people as normal. findings: it begins by acknowledging the full range of people's normal wants and their benefits – utilitarian, expressive and emotional – distinguishes normal wants from errors and offers guidance on using shortcuts and avoiding errors on the way to satisfying normal wants. people's normal wants include financial security, nurturing children and families, gaining high social status and staying true to values. people's normal wants, even more than their cognitive and emotional shortcuts and errors, underlie answers to important questions of finance, including saving and spending, portfolio construction, asset pricing and market efficiency. originality/value: the article identifies that people's normal wants include financial security, nurturing children and families, gaining high social status and staying true to values. people's normal wants, even more than their cognitive and emotional shortcuts and errors, underlie answers to important questions of finance, including saving and spending, portfolio construction, asset pricing and market efficiency. © 2020, emerald publishing limited."

"since the last global crisis, the critical debate on economy and the teaching of heterodox economy has resurfaced. to review the magnitude and pedagogical consequences for critical education in economics and finance is the objective of this paper, which also proposes a didactic strategy based on an experience developed at the university of extremadura (spain) within the framework of the didactic innovation group named ""ethics of university teaching"". for this purpose, the educational implications of teaching and learning the conventional economy that derive from behavioral and cognitive psychology and discourses on entrepreneurship and corporate social responsibility are reviewed. it is concluded that the bias in the education of heterodox economy supposes a deterioration of the fundamental educational objectives, tending towards an indoctrination in the neoliberal ideology (patriarcapitalist) and to a serious loss of democratic values. for all the above, a more pluralist pedagogy at the epistemological and methodological levels-from critical psychology to critical economics or critical management studies-would help to favor a more emancipatory educational process, committed to social justice. © 2020 by the authors."

"purpose: this paper answers, in the chinese stock market, who can realize the “spot value” of corporate social responsibility (csr). design/methodology/approach: the authors use event-study to build the research framework. using csr report content analysis, the authors measure the specification level of csr disclosure. applying the baidu index, the authors mine chinese investors’ profiles data to investigate retail investor heterogeneity closely. findings: the authors find strong evidence that the measure captures a behavioral bias in csr pricing: firms that choose to disclose csr report experience positive abnormal return more among retail investors than institutional investors, more among young investors than older, but no difference between female and male investors. practical implications: for chinese public firms, the authors give them evidence that they can realize positive abnormal returns by applying certain csr disclosure strategies. for chinese investors, especially retail investors and youths, the authors ask them to rethink whether their positive evaluation of csr is a rational trade-off choice or whether they are fooled by the “hedging mask” and “attention-grabbing.” social implications: the findings can give some suggestions to regulators: encouraging voluntary disclosure and reducing mandatory disclosure can drive enterprises to engage in more csr activities because the voluntarily csr disclosure can realize both long-term value and “spot value.” complementarily, a more rigorous csr report auditing regulation can suppress the “greenwash” by increasing the “lying cost.” originality/value: using behavioral finance theory, the authors connect the gap between neoclassical research on the “u-shaped” value realization of csr and the increasing voluntary csr disclosure in the chinese market. the authors find that heuristic reason and emotionality orientation results in the chinese “csr-friendly” market. © 2020, emerald publishing limited."

"this paper scrutinizes different aspects of the adaptive market hypothesis (amh) in the moroccan financial market over the period from january 1992 to september 2019 through different approaches. on the basis of daily returns on masi index, we measure the evolution of efficiency degree based on the linear and nonlinear tests with rolling window. one of the practical implications of the amh is that the profit opportunities arise from time to time depending on the degree of market efficiency and according to market conditions. to investigate this implication, we track the evolving performance of momentum-based trading strategies and the extent to which this performance is related to the market efficiency degree and certain market conditions. the linear and nonlinear tests reveal that the efficiency degree is time-varying. moreover, we find via momentum test that profit opportunities appear from time to time and disappear once they are exploited. interestingly, the momentum profits depend on both the degree of market efficiency and some market conditions. thus, the investors can capitalize on the inefficiency and certain market conditions using trading strategies such momentum. overall, our findings are consistent with the amh framework, which is proved to be a better explanation of the behavior of emerging markets than the efficiency market hypothesis (emh). © 2020; efficiency market hypothesis (emh); adaptive market hypothesis (amh); behavioral finance; evolving trading strategies; time-varying momentum profits; emerging markets; social sciences; economics; finance; behavioral economics; macroeconomics; business © 2020"

"the corona virus disease 2019 (covid-19) has collapsed the world's economy. a discussion of the reaction to structural and regional policies is imperative for the chinese government because the implementation of policies is limited. as the state of the stock market indicates the direction of the economy, the financial reports of some enterprises from china's stock market for the first quarter of 2020 were collected and analyzed. this was the period in which the productivity of the enterprises were severely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic with respect to industry, actors' scale, and region. the results show: 1) except agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery, all other industries had lesser profit and limited operating cash flow, and their balance sheets had deteriorated. the services industry faced more challenges than the others. the behavioral decisions made by individuals, the governmental policies for lock-down, and the nature of industries were responsible for these detrimental changes; 2) the companies with small and medium market value were affected more than big enterprises. in q1, big companies made more profits, optimized their operating cash flows, and stabilized their balance sheets. this is mainly because of the difference of operating ability among actors and the matthew effect; 3) owing to the differences in the population structure and land price in different regions, the manufacture, service, and building and estate industries faced greater challenges in the developed provinces than in the less developed regions. the pandemic adversely affected the finance industry in beijing, shanghai, and guangdong; however, it showed improvement in jiangsu. it has been observed that the financial structure in regions, and operating ability of companies were the main reasons for the negative impact on the finance industry. the medical industry was affected but progressed in areas with better industrial basement. this was because the demand for certain medicines and devices peaked during the period and the areas with better industrial base played more important role in fighting the virus. in this context, the authors discussed the two approaches: ""adopting a more proactive fiscal policy and deeply optimizing financial environment of enterprises, "" and ""choosing policies implements regionally."" it can be argued that unilateral expansion of demand will result in a larger gap between demand and supply. this is disadvantageous because the global production system mainly depends on the manufacturing industry in china. the government should not only focus on resumption, but also start investment of new or traditional infrastructures. moreover, owing to the uncertainty of the market, the factors that improve the balance sheet are few. therefore, helping more entities by financial market and making the social capital more active have become the priorities for the government. in order to improve the manufacturing and service industry, undeveloped regions are encouraged to expand job opportunities, and the residents in developed regions are encouraged to consume more services and decrease the operating costs of the service industry. this can positively contribute to restoring the economy. some measures adopted to benefit financial and building and estate industries are encouraging local commercial banks in medium-sized and small cities to provide loans to small and medium-sized enterprises (smes), boost infrastructure construction in developed regions, and loosen control of estate development. the policy makers of the medical industry were advised to focus on long-term development. optimizing the financial environments for smes in medical industry and developing a multi-core, nation-wide distribution of industry are necessary for china. © 2020 tropical geography. all rights reserved."
"although the major part of literature on foreign direct investment fdi is largely based on the assumption of imperfections in goods and factor markets, a small but growing literature has been looking for a potential impact of imperfections in capital markets which resulted in the development of a group of financial theories on fdi over the years. we examine 119 articles including 104 articles published in 59 leading journals, and 9 classic books. we use the qualitative methodology to analyze their content. the analysis enabled us to identify four main strands of financial theories on fdi. the first explains fdi as a response to different exchange rate variables. the second one applies the portfolio theory to international diversification by multinationals. third strand sees fdi through the lens of behavioral finance. finally, the last strand investigates the distinct internationalization path that is followed by financially disadvantaged multinationals domiciled in emerging countries. the analysis revealed theoretical inconsistencies within each group and among different groups of financial theories that is also translated into inconclusive empirical results on many occasions. the analysis also uncovered a geographical bias where in multinationals and fdi from emerging countries are substantially under researched. while the idea of forming one financial theory on fdi is attractive, our suggestion is that future research should opt for a context-specific inclusion of financial factors until the debate about the efficiency of financial markets is settled. © 2019, associazione amici di economia e politica industriale."

"two glaring anomalies in investment management are apparent: (1) after fees, active portfolio managers do worse than market indices, and (2) clients continue to pay for services they don’t receive. the purpose of this paper is to offer explanations of these anomalies from a behavioral perspective. we explore some of the cognitive biases that perpetuate active management and subsequent underperformance, including herding, disposition, and endowment effects, as well as conservatism and status quo biases, overconfidence, and agency problems. investors’ continued use of active managers despite persistent disappointing returns is attributed to being victims of framing effect, hot-hand fallacy, lack of knowledge as well as intimidation or insecurity, and status quo bias. we propose some ways that portfolio managers and investors could improve their decision making. © 2019, © 2019 the institute of behavioral finance."
"the phenomenon of high first-day income and high break-up rate in china’s capital market has long attracted the attention of investors. based on the disagreement model, in combination with the information asymmetry theory and behavioral finance, a mathematical model was put forward to analyze the reasons and mechanisms for the excess return of the initial public offering (ipo) on the first-day under the influence of investors’ sentiments. the analysis shows that the ipo first-day income is a function of the disagreement between investors, which generally presents an asymmetric u shape. information asymmetry affects the degree of valuation deviation. the sentiment of investors reflects the psychological state of the investor at the time, which makes the income increase or decrease under the influence of investor sentiment and market sentiment. in turn, it leads to the emergence of excess returns or break-up rates on the first-day. the research results help deepen the understanding of the ipo pricing mechanism and explore the impact of investor psychology on its pricing, putting forward suggestions for the issue pricing mechanism of the sci-tech innovation board. © copyright © 2020 zhong, yan, li and chen."
"medicaid expansion has been shown to improve access to care, health, and finances in general populations. until now no studies have considered how medicaid expansion may affect informal family caregivers who are the backbone of the long term supports and services infrastructure. family caregivers provide substantial cost savings to medicare and medicaid. yet, they sustain financial, physical, and mental health strain from their caregiving role which medicaid expansion may offset. this study evaluated the impact of medicaid expansion on caregivers’ mental health using 2015–2018 data from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system. after adjusting for demographics, socioeconomic status, and health behaviors, caregivers in medicaid expansion states had a significantly fewer number of poor mental health days in the previous month than caregivers in non-expansion states (ß = −0.528, ci −1.019, −0.036, p < .01). study findings indicate that medicaid expansion state status was protective for caregiver’s mental health. © 2020 taylor & francis group, llc."
"this paper aims to explore the relationship between information asymmetry and stock momentum. using winner and loser approach, we find that winners with exaggerated forecast of earnings per share are more likely to have contrarian profits in subsequent holding periods. on the contrary, winners with low or middle-low information asymmetry tend to continue their good returns in future holding periods. in addition, the losers with middle information asymmetry achieve the highest contrarian profits, which may be called “white lie effects.” © 2020; information asymmetry, stock momentum, contrarian profits, trading strategy, white lie effects; economics; finance; corporate finance; international finance; behavioral economics; accounting. © 2020"
"under the background of socialized small- scale farming operation, the complexity of farming households’willingness and behavior directly affects the diversity of farmland function supply. by summarizing the behavioral characteristics of socialized small-scale farmers and taking farming households’ response to the demand for agricultural land multi- functions as the intermediary factor, this study constructed a conceptual path analysis model, and used the structural equation (sem) to fit the model to analyze the direct effects of farming household differentiation on the diversification of agricultural land function supply and its indirect effects through the intermediary factor as well, in order to explore the influences and paths. the empirical study of six research areas in huangpi, xinzhou, ezhou, jiangxia, tongshan, and caidian of hubei province showed that the differentiation of farmers has both direct and indirect negative effects on the diversification of farmland function supply. the more livelihood capital the farming households possess, the lower the diversity of farmland functions they supply. the direct negative effects of farmer differentiation on the diversification of farmland function supply mainly come from the substitution of some production factors caused by the externalization of agricultural production conditions under the trend of socialized small- scale farmers, such as the weakening of ecological function of agricultural land caused by the loss of high- quality labor force and the substitution between the elements of labor force and chemical fertilizer or pesticide; while the indirect negative effect are mainly from the mismatch of three types of production factors which means the input of the three types of factors has not reached incentive compatibility, thus affecting the output efficiency of agricultural land multi- functions. therefore, we need to pay attention to the new connection and infiltration of production factors, and make them compatible with material elements. as far as our research areas are concerned, first, it is necessary to broaden the traditional way of agricultural land use, deepen farmers’cognition of the external production conditions of agricultural land, and alleviate the dependence of farming households on external production conditions by means of social security and finance, so as to attract high- quality agricultural labor force to return; in addition, it is also necessary to improve the transfer of land rights and build an information exchange platform to promote the multi-functional utilization of agricultural land. © 2020 editorial department of resource science. all rights reserved."
"i study behavioral responses to the green building certification system developed by the leadership in energy and environmental design program (leed). leed provides four different certification levels (certified, silver, gold, and platinum) that are all defined by a specific threshold. using micro data on leed-certified buildings, i document bunching of buildings at or slightly above the different cutoffs. the findings are robust to different specifications, observed for different versions of leed. using the methods from the public finance literature, which studies bunching responses to ‘kinks’ and ‘notches’ in tax systems (e.g., kleven and waseem, 2013; chetty et al., 2011), i quantify the bunching mass at each threshold and for different us states to explain variance in observed bunching. using cross-sectional variation in bunching across different states of the us, i find a significant negative relationship between the bunching estimators and energy prices. this finding suggests that higher energy prices provide investors with incentives to compare the detailed product features and in turn reduces the building developers’ incentive to situate right at the certification cutoff. © 2019 elsevier b.v."

"in classical finance theory, cognitive bias does not play any role in predicting returns. with the development of the economy, the classical theory gradually finds it difficult to offset the irrational demand through arbitrage. due to the rise of behavioral economics, how to allocate stock portfolios in the highly subjective environment is an unavoidable problem. considering the decision heterogeneity between the rational market and the irrational one, the mean-variance (mv) method was improved in the construction of a market bias index for stock portfolio allocation, which we called emacb (exponential moving average of cognitive bias)-variance method. besides, due to the lack of related research, we introduced a measure of aggregate investor cognitive bias by adopting the state-space model. finally, the proposed method was applied in an investment allocation example to prove its feasibility, and its advantages were emphasized by a comparison with another relevant approach. © 2020 by the authors."
"this study aimed to calculate the breadth, depth, and overall outreach score with case studies of several islamic cooperatives in east java. generally, the level of this outreach is not too high, but it continuously showed an increase from 2014 to 2018. those cooperatives with relatively small assets tend to have high outreach scores. meanwhile, those with large assets have a lower outreach level. therefore, this study utilized the tobit regression analysis in order to investigate the factors that influence outreach score. the results showed that size, non-performing financing (npf), number of branches, grants, financial leverage, and age have a significant impact on islamic cooperatives' outreach. an interesting finding is that size has a negative effect. this is in contrast with the spirit to develop cooperatives in indonesia. also, a high npf can significantly decrease the level outreach. meanwhile, the increase in the number of grants appears to have a positive impact. thus, through action research since 2012 and fgd on the management of islamic cooperatives, this study provided an explanation on why these conditions can occur. © 2020 the author(s); breadth and depth outreach; islamic cooperatives; size, non-performing finance; grant; corporate finance; financial economics; behavioral economics; social inequality; social responsibility; economics. © 2020 the author(s)"

"this paper develops a computational framework for inverting gompertz–makeham mortality hazard rates, consistent with compensation laws of mortality for heterogeneous populations, to define a longevity-risk-adjusted global (l-rag) age. to illustrate its salience and possible applications, the paper calibrates and presents l-rag values using country data from the human mortality database (hmd). among other things, the author demonstrates that when properly benchmarked, the longevity-risk-adjusted global age of a 55-year-old swedish male is 48, whereas a 55-year-old russian male is closer in age to 67. the paper also discusses the connection between the proposed l-rag age and the related concept of biological age, from the medical and gerontology literature. practically speaking, in a world of growing mortality heterogeneity, the l-rag age could be used for pension and retirement policy. in the language of behavioral finance and economics, a salient metric that adjusts chronological age for longevity risk might help capture the public's attention, educate them about lifetime uncertainty and induce many of them to take action — such as working longer and/or retiring later. © 2020 the author(s)"

"purpose: decision-making process about financial investment is complicated. relying on modern financial theory to explain behaviours of individual investors is inadequate because it focuses on the objective risk as the determinant for making investment decisions under the assumption that individuals are rational. the current study, which was built from the financial, sociological and psychological perspectives, investigated the predictors of risk perception and determined the association of risk perception and attitude toward financial investment intention. this study served the purpose of unravelling the complexity of the financial investment decision-making process among individuals. design/methodology/approach: the research framework was based on perception formation model (pfm) with further support from the theory of planned behaviour, decision making models under risk, and knowledge-attitudebehaviour model. purposive-sampling method was adopted. the dataset, which consisted a total of 492 responses from income earners below the age of prime savings years were entered for analysis. twelve hypotheses were tested using the analysis of moment structures (amos) statistical software. findings: measurement-model assessment revealed the data fitted well to the research model results from the structural-model assessment revealed subjective knowledge, peer influence, internet influence, and risk propensity had a significant relationship with favourable risk perception. consistent with the pfm proposition, it was found favourable risk perception significantly related to higher intention toward financial investment. research limitations/implications: the resultant outcomes strengthen the understanding of how financial investment decision is performed by individuals, which is crucial in the personal-finance industry, especially in promoting a long-term and meaningful client-advisor relationship. interestingly, objective knowledge, which measured the actual level of financial knowledge was found to be insignificantly associated with risk perception and intention toward financial investment. as a sizeable financial literature posited financial knowledge has impact on decision-making process, future study could perhaps examine whether objective knowledge could contextually alter the relationship between predictors and the endogenous variable. originality/value: the study has successfully identified several predictors for risk perception about financial investment and provided an empirical link for knowledge-perception-attitude-intention, thus, enriching the behavioural finance literature. the research model was robust as it was formulated based on the three major pillars of behavioral finance, namely: financial, sociological, and psychological perspectives. © 2020 people and global business association."

"prospect theory and behavioral finance are gaining recognition as useful frameworks for the analysis of economic behaviors. yet, behavioral finance is generally concerned with specific anomalies and individual behaviors and does not deal with market indices. to bridge this gap, the authors studied the changes in the value of implied volatility indices on several markets, relative to changes in the level of the corresponding equity indices with dividends reinvestment. we hypothesized that the relation should follow the psychological tenets of prospect theory. in accordance with this hypothesis, the authors found concavity in the gain area, convexity in the loss area, and evidence that market losses have more impact than gains on the pricing of implied volatility indices. these findings are observed in all the markets under consideration and are robust to the use of different functional forms. the parameters are in the range observed in previous laboratory studies but vary in different trading environments. © 2019, © 2019 the institute of behavioral finance."
"the behavioral finance literature attributes failed m&as to ceo overconfidence. we investigate the source of ceo overconfidence that leads to failed m&as. among various determinants of ceo overconfidence, we propose that power-led ceo overconfidence delivers undesirable consequences in corporate investments. using ceo-level data, we find that ceo power increases the probability of a ceo being overconfident. we also show that power-led overconfident ceos tend to complete more deals regardless of economic circumstances, do stock acquisitions, and make diversifying acquisitions, relative to non-overconfident ceos. the results suggest that the findings of previous studies on m&as by overconfident ceos could be driven by power-led overconfident ceos. © 2019 elsevier inc."

"purpose: the purpose of this paper is to study the individual investors’ preferences towards stock selection in social media environments. the study is conducted to understand the implications and conceptual directions for the corporates and financial advisors to understand the choices of individual investors applied in financial markets. further, this study aims to examine the selection of the most preferred social media platform and behavioral intentions of investors towards selection of investment portfolios in indian stock markets. design/methodology/approach: a questionnaire was designed based on the technique of conjoint analysis and was responded by 428 respondents belonging to the northern region of india. the estimation of preference functions in conjoint analysis was designed by using orthogonal arrays and was calculated using the ordinary least square regression technique. findings: this study reveals that while making selection of desired investment portfolios, the investors give highest preference to social media platforms in terms of highest utility value and range followed by their preference for behavioral intentions to invest. among different social media platforms, the investors preferred twitter the most, followed by facebook and the primary interest of investors was observed towards intra-day trading purposes and balanced portfolio investments in financial markets. the major reason behind opting the social media platforms was selection of speculative stocks. research limitations/implications: the actual individual investment behavior cannot be observed through the survey, which limits the external validity of the study. practical implications: the paper presents a very important practical tool that can help financial advisors, opinion leaders and corporates in defining their target audience more sharply for investment-related advice. the findings revealed by the study will put them in a better position to understand how investors differ behaviorally and they will get acquainted with their choices and preferences while making investment decisions in the backdrop of social media environments. the preferences of the investors based on social media usage discovered by the study will not only enable the individual investors understand their own preferences, but those of the other investors as well in terms of planned investment decisions and choices. originality/value: the paper is a first of its kind to empirically identify the individual investors and their preferences and choices by applying conjoint analysis in the new social media environment. the study thus integrates the gap between marketing theories and emerging theories of behavioral finance to understand the investor behavior in a better way. © 2019, emerald publishing limited."
"the conventional finance theories, including capital asset pricing model (capm), assume rational agents at the core of all investment decisions and overlook how real people make decisions. practically, however, investment behavior differs and is dependent on the type of investor. this study aims to examine the behavioral biases in investment decision making by using the moderating role of investor’s type (it). a survey-based questionnaire was designed and circulated to accumulate the feedback of small investors in the pakistan stock exchange (psx). an investment decision making was modeled with disposition effect (de), herding (he) effect, and overconfidence (oc) bias, whereas an it was taken as a moderating variable. multiple regressions were employed to test the effect of different behavioral biases on investment decision making. twostage least square (2sls) regressions were used for the moderating effect of it. the findings depicted that de, he bias, and oc biases have a significant and positive impact on investment decisions. however, the investor prevails that in de, such a moderating role is not present, and the positive moderating role of oc bias in the investment decision portrayed. additionally, it has a negative moderating role in he bias. the outcomes postulated that active investors show more oc bias, while inactive investors are more inclined toward he bias. the findings of the study may have important policy implications for investment analysts and policymakers in terms of educating investors and ensuring better decision making. © 2020 mykolo romerio universitetas. all rights reserved."

"the authors explore the interaction between media content and market returns and volatility. they utilize propriety investor sentiment measures developed by thompson reuters marketpsych. the data are from a commercial-strength comprehensive textual analysis that provides 24-hr rolling average scores of total references in the news and social media by counting overall positive references net of negative references. the authors select 4 measures of investor sentiment that reflect both pessimism and optimism of small investors. these measures are fear, gloom, joy, and stress. the objective is twofold. first, the authors examine the ability of these sentiment measures to predict market returns. second, they are interested in exploring the effects of these sentiment measures on market return and volatility. for this purpose, the authors utilize threshold generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity models. they explore the ability of sentiment measures to predict both the level of and change in market returns. the sentiment measure of stress has a small effect on the market return for a 1-day lag. the other 2 sentiment measures, gloom and joy, seem to play no role in predicting market returns. furthermore, the authors find that fear among investors has a major and lasting effect on market returns and conditional volatility. © 2019, © 2019 the institute of behavioral finance."
"this paper introduces the concept of loss aversion in behavioral finance, and studies an optimal reinsurance and investment problem for a loss-averse insurer. most investors are risk-averse towards gains, but they will change to be risk-seeking when they suffer from losses, so we assume that the insurer's goal is to chose the optimal strategy to maximize the expected s-shaped utility from the terminal wealth. the surplus process of the insurer is assumed to follow a classical cramér-lundberg model and the insurer is allowed to purchase proportional reinsurance. moreover, the insurer can invest in a risk-free asset and a risky asset. by martingale approach and lagrange dual theory, we derive the optimal strategy. finally, numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effects of model parameters on the optimal terminal wealth and the optimal strategy. © 2020, editorial board of journal of systems engineering society of china. all right reserved."
"technological developments have given shape to robotic services which have forayed in the finance and investment industry in the form of robo-advisors. robo-advisors are in use in the developed nations since over a decade but have recently entered the developing nations, like india, since early 2015. this research explores the present state of robo-advisory services in the indian context and investigates how robo-advisors can help in mitigating behavioral biases of a retail investor. the present study gives an in-depth understanding about the ability of robo-advisory to mitigate behavioral biases from the perspective of experts. these experts are from the product development team, quality control team, middleware, or at top management level from bfsi (banking and financial services industry), it (information technology), fintech (finance technology) and nbfcs (non-banking finance companies) in india. the researchers have adopted a qualitative approach, of interviewing these experts, to discover the phenomenon and gain insight about robo-advisory services. each interview was recorded and transcribed on word-for-word basis. the transcribed content underwent a structured content analysis, using different categories, resulting from the conducted literature review. the intent is not to generalize the findings, since the field of robo-advisory is at a nascent stage as far as indian market is concerned. the key findings indicate that the current focus is to increase awareness level amongst investors, by educating them and by building trust. our conclusion emphasizes the fact that robo-advisors still need to mitigate investor's biases while performing risk analysis and profiling the investors. robo-advisory platforms are not yet comprehensively self-sufficient to accurately perform risk analysis for retail investors. © 2020"
"purpose: the purpose of this paper is to investigate how access to financing for incremental as well as radical innovation activities is affected by firm-specific structural and behavioral characteristics. design/methodology/approach: deploying a two-stage heckman probit model on survey data spanning the period 2000–2013 and covering 1,169 firms, this paper analyzes the effect of a firm’s engagement in incremental and radical innovation on its likelihood to get constrained in their access to external finance, and how this effect is moderated by the firm’s age and size. findings: in line with earlier research, it is confirmed that the type of innovation matters for the access to external finance, but in a more nuanced way than generally portrayed. while incremental innovation activities have little negative effect on the access to external finance, radical innovation activities tend to be penalized by capital markets. this effect appears to be particularly strong for small firms. originality/value: this paper provides nuanced insights into the interplay between types of firm-level innovation activities, structural characteristic and access to external finance. © 2019, daniel stefan hain and jesper lindgaard christensen."

"determining whether investment strategies exist that provide higher (risk-adjusted) returns than buying and holding the s&p 500 stock market index is not only highly relevant for finance theory, but also for the asset management industry. this study conducts a comprehensive test using realistic investment strategies based on monthly seasonalities, technical indicators, and fundamental factors (over 4,100 strategies in total). to assess statistical significance, we use hansen's data-snooping-resistant spa test. the results show that only investment strategies trying to exploit underreaction and overreaction effects with technical indicators dominate the buy-and-hold strategy in some simulation setups. these investment strategies are clearly superior to the strategies based on seasonalities and fundamental factors. given that underreaction and overreaction effects are mainly justified with cognitive biases, our results support the economic relevance of behavioral finance insights. © 2019 university of new orleans"
"we explain main concepts of behavioral finance within the framework of the rational dynamic asset pricing theory (rdapt). we discuss key modifications of the cumulative prospect theory (pt) weighting function to preserve key characteristics of the price process essential for deducting derivatives pricing. we then move to value-function and provide an overview of how it relates to optimality in the framework of the rational finance theory common risk and return measures such as var, conditional var, range-value-at-risk, and other related risk functions. we provide guidelines regarding how those theoretical results could be implemented and used in practice. ultimately, the chapter bridges the gap between rational and behavioral finance by introducing both a consistent weighting function and value-function maximization criteria based on rational-finance accepted risk and return measures. although the main motivation of the chapter has been inspired by wealth management applications, the results certainly have broader applications for both active and passive managers, such as market sentiment extraction, novel designs of quantitative strategies, as well as behavior- avor design of etfs and smart-beta funds. © 2021 by world scientific publishing co. pte. ltd."
"purpose: the sustainable development of islamic banking services has motivated a significant number of depositors to choose islamic bank services instead of the conventional bank. there are various factors that can persuade the depositors’ choice to choose an islamic bank. this paper aims to examine the factors that persuade individuals’ behavioral intention to choose islamic bank services. design/methodology/approach: to achieve this objective, this study uses the theory of planned behavior (tpb) as the underlying theory to measure the factors that persuade the depositors’ behavioral intention to choose islamic bank services. a total of 300 questionnaires were distributed to the malaysian islamic bank’s depositors in peninsular malaysia. the data from the questionnaires were analyzed using structural equation modeling (sem). findings: the result showed the three variables that predicted behavioral intentions of the depositors, namely, attitude (att), subjective norms (sn) and perceived behavioral control (pbc), were found to be significant in persuading depositors’ behavioral intention to choose islamic bank services. furthermore, the findings of the study also confirmed the relevance of using tpb to measure the depositors’ behavioral intention. the results could advance knowledge in the area of islamic finance and also have positive implications for practitioners. originality/value: the study offers an insight into the present environment involving islamic banking services which was established in malaysia 30 years ago. in the context of the current study, the present environment refers to the depositors’ intention to opt for the service and the factors that influence the depositors to choose islamic banking services apart from the religious factor which has been well acknowledged by a significant number of previous studies. © 2019, emerald publishing limited."

"background: with rising costs of cancer care, this study aims to estimate the prevalence of, and factors associated with, medical financial hardship intensity and financial sacrifices due to cancer in the united states. methods: we identified 963 cancer survivors from the 2016 medical expenditures panel survey - experiences with cancer. medical financial hardship due to cancer was measured in material (e.g., filed for bankruptcy), psychological (e.g., worry about paying bills and finances), and behavioral (e.g., delaying or forgoing care due to cost) domains. nonmedical financial sacrifices included changes in spending and use of savings. multivariable logistic models were used to identify characteristics associated with hardship intensity and sacrifices stratified by age group (18 64 or 65 years). results: among cancer survivors ages 18 to 64 years, 53.6%, 28.4%, and 11.4% reported at least one, two, or all three domains of hardship, respectively. among survivors ages 65 years, corresponding percentages were 42.0%, 12.7%, and 4.0%, respectively. moreover, financial sacrifices due to cancer were more common in survivors ages 18 to 64 years (54.2%) than in survivors 65 years (38.4%; p < 0.001). factors significantly associated with hardship intensity in multivariable analyses included low income and educational attainment, racial/ethnic minority, comorbidity, lack of private insurance coverage, extended employment change, and recent cancer treatment. most were also significantly associated with financial sacrifices. conclusions: medical financial hardship and financial sacrifices are substantial among cancer survivors in the united states, particularly for younger survivors. impact: efforts to mitigate financial hardship for cancer survivors are warranted, especially for those at high risk. © 2020 american association for cancer research inc.. all rights reserved."
"purpose: the research paper is an effort to find out the behavior of pakistani individuals toward usage of takaful insurance. this paper aims to identify the factors, which influence investors’ intention toward the adoption of takaful. islamic finance is growing rapidly in the international market, especially in islamic countries. pakistan is an islamic country, where the majority of the population is muslim. therefore, there is a great potential for takaful exists in the country. design/methodology/approach: both explanatory and descriptive research designs used for the research framework. the theory of planned behavior is the base theory and the model incorporates several factors such as relative advantage, compatibility, social influence, awareness and religiosity that may influence the adoption of takaful. the primary data collected through the distribution of self-administered survey-based questionnaire, containing 23 items scaled at a five-point likert scale. the non-probability snowball sampling and judgmental sampling techniques are used due to the scarce of takaful users. the sample consists of 345 individuals (127 takaful users and 218 non-users) living in the three main cities, namely, karachi, lahore and islamabad. the data are further analyzed and interpreted with ibm spss 21. the results are evaluated using descriptive statistics, reliability, confirmatory factor analysis, correlation and binary logistic regression models. findings: the research findings reveal that factors such as relative advantage, compatibility, social influence, awareness and religiosity have a significant impact on the behavioral intention of takaful amongst a depicted sample of pakistani people. similarly, takaful has great potential in the pakistani market, but due to lack of awareness, takaful share is far behind than conventional insurance. it is further suggested that takaful operators must devise some policies and plan to spread awareness about takaful and come up with more innovative products. practical implications: the takaful operators must devise plans to aware people about islamic insurance. the study provides implication to takaful management; takaful users; and more importantly, the regularity authorities to operate and successfully conduct takaful applications. further, they should advance takaful operations and produce more innovative products. the study focuses on some factors while there are plenty of others, which should be studied accordingly. for future researchers and students, there is a great potential of other techniques and measures, which can be further used for analysis of takaful business. originality/value: this research is a first attempt to trace out the behavior of pakistani people about takaful, using the above discussed factors. the behavioral intention is studied using users and non-users combination, which is never done before in the current setting. © 2019, emerald publishing limited."
"the omnipresent and reoccurring market bubbles and crashes have been puzzling both finance professionals and academics. important economic theories such as the efficient market hypothesis indicate that, rationally, mispricing of assets traded on stock markets should not occur. however, this is not the case in real life. behavioral and neuroscientific studies have provided an important contribution to explaining the psychological mechanisms driving the behavior of individual stock market players as well as the market in general. this chapter presents the most influential scientific work devoted to stock markets, bubbles, and crashes. it provides a brief overview of the research aiming to explain behavioral phenomena on stock markets. first, it outlines the key terminology and classification of market bubbles and crashes. second, it reviews the psychological and economic literature devoted to experiencing extreme financial events. despite a low number of studies, the general conclusion is that experiencing a strongly negative financial event would lead to decreased risk-taking in the future. next, the reader’s attention is drawn to a range of typical cognitive biases present in the stock market. group-think, the disposition effect, overconfidence, and home bias are among the most researched biases. finally, the chapter presents experimental asset markets-a strand of experimental studies investigating coordination on the stock markets. this type of work has gained prominence after the invention of the ssw design-the nobel prize winning experimental method. the chapter concludes with a short note on econophysics-a field that deals with simulation and prediction of stock market players’ behavior. © springer nature switzerland ag 2020."
"in recent years, based on the experience of mature capital markets such as hong kong and the united states, china’s supervisory authorities have successively introduced policies such as ipo super-financing and transfer of old stocks, with a view to further improving china’s ipo inquiry issuance mechanism. however, in the practice of ipos in china, there have been ipo phenomena such as “three-highs”, “cashing-in old stock”, “skyrocketing and plummeting” and “high underpricing”. not only are these phenomena far beyond the expectations of stock regulatory authorities, they have also led many parties to question the direction of china’s ipo inquiry marketization reform. doubts from external sources have also made china’s ipo reform a major issue for academic research and discussion. at present, scholars have yet to explore the effectiveness of china’s old stock transfer system from the perspective of theory and evidence. theoretical and empirical interpretation of ipo pricing efficiency under china’s old system will not only help in identifying the existing problems of china’s market-oriented reforms, but will also bear important guiding significance for china’s next ipo marketization reform. combining the research methods of behavioral finance and information asymmetry, this paper constructs the ipo pricing and underpricing models before and after the transfer of old stocks, and uses matlab software to carry out numerical analysis. based on the empirical analysis of china’s 2009-2012 and 2014 ipo data, this paper analyzes the influence of investor behavior on ipo pricing efficiency before and after the transfer of old stocks, and discusses the mechanism of action between investor behaviors, changes in the old stock transfer system, and ipo pricing efficiency. first, based on the assumption that there is private information not disclosed among investors, the cara model is used to construct the investor expectation utility function, and in combination with changes in the mechanism before and after the transfer of old stocks in china, used to derive ipo pricing and underpricing models for before and after the transfer. the influence of heterogeneous investor behavior on ipo pricing efficiency before and after the transfer of old stocks was compared and analyzed. the research shows that: (1) under two different systems, the more optimistic the retail investors are, the lower the ipo pricing efficiency, and the greater the difference in opinion between retail investors and institutional investors, the lower the ipo pricing efficiency; (2) in the case of the same investor sentiment, the old stock transfer system reduces ipo underpricing and demonstrates higher pricing efficiency; (3) when the dissonance between investors under the old stock transfer system is greater than the dissonance under the new stock over-pricing system, ipo underpricing under the old system may be more exacerbated than under the new system, such that under the old stock transfer system, ipo underpricing is greater, and ipo pricing is less efficient. second, using the ipo underpricing model, china’s listed companies as a sample, numerical analysis methods, and matlab mapping, the conclusions of the paper are furthered analyzed and proven. that is, the greater the divergence in opinion between retail investors and institutional investors, the lower the ipo pricing efficiency; the old stock transfer system improves ipo pricing efficiency, but once the transition is made to the new stock over-pricing system, the divergence in opinion between investors become greater. the divergence, on the contrary, reduces the efficiency of ipo pricing. finally, using the ipo data of 2009-2012 and 2014 in china’s shenzhen and shanghai cities as samples, as well as empirical analysis methods, ipo pricing efficiency changes before and after the transfer of old stocks are compared and analyzed, along with changes in investor sentiment before and after the transfer of old stocks, and the paper’s conclusion proven. via empirical research, it was found that the old stock transfer system not only did not reduce ipo underpricing, but actually increased ipo underpricing and reduced ipo pricing efficiency. through empirical research, it was further discovered that the impact of investor sentiment on ipo underpricing after the transfer of old stock changed significantly; largely because the transfer of old stock has heightened the optimism of chinese investors, resulting in greater ipo underpricing and lower ipo pricing efficiency. the empirical research also demonstrates that the ipo pricing efficiency of china’s old stock transfer system is in exact opposition to the predictions of the theoretical model. in short, under the rational thinking process of investors in the securities market, the transfer of old stocks can indeed improve the efficiency of ipo pricing. however, when investors in the securities market have irrational emotions, the old stock transfer system fails, which not only exacerbates ipo underpricing, but also lowers ipo pricing efficiency. due to the excessive optimism of investors in china’s securities market, which deviates from the theoretical prediction, it is the most important objective of china’s supervisory authorities to improve the rationality of investors in the securities market. © 2020"
"using an investor sentiment index and an index of sentiment changes for the korean stock market, this study examines how investor sentiment affects a cross-section of stock returns. i examine whether more speculative and harder-to-arbitrage stocks are more sensitive to sentiment, that is, whether their returns co-move more with sentiment changes. i also test whether the returns on extremely unspeculative stocks are negatively related to changes in sentiment, that is, whether they have negative sentiment betas. according to studies on behavioral finance (shleifer and summers, 1990; lee, shleifer, and thaler, 1991), because a mispricing is the result of an irrational demand shock in the presence of a binding arbitrage constraint, shifts in investor sentiment have cross-sectional effects when sentiment-based demands or arbitrage limits vary across stocks. consistent with these predictions, prior empirical studies (baker and wurgler, 2006, 2007; kumar and lee, 2006) report that more speculative and harder-to-arbitrage stocks—smaller, newer, more volatile, unprofitable, non-dividend paying, distressed or those with extreme growth potential—are more likely to be affected by shifts in investor sentiment. however, the effect of sentiment on the aggregate market is somewhat less clear. brown and cliff (2004) show that sentiment has little predictive power for near-term future stock returns, and schmeling (2009) insist that the effect of sentiment on aggregate stock returns is observed only in the countries that are culturally more prone to herd-like behavior. to reconcile the cross-sectional results and the aggregate results, baker and wurgler (2007) suggest one possible explanation known as “the sentiment seesaw,” in that if sentiment fluctuations induce demand shifts between speculative stocks and safe stocks, that is, “the flights to quality within the stock market” occur, the low (high) sentiment reduces (increases) the prices of speculative stocks and at the same time increases (decreases) the prices of safe stocks, resulting in no effect of sentiment on aggregate market returns. in line with this idea, this study analyzes the effect of broad-waved sentiment on a cross-section of stock returns in terms of sensitivity to sentiment. using financial parlance, i investigate whether more speculative and harder-to- arbitrage stocks have higher sentiment betas, and whether extremely unspeculative and easier-to-arbitrage stocks have negative sentiment betas. as in practice, the same securities that are most sensitive to speculative demands also tend to be the costliest to arbitrage, i hypothesize that stocks most sensitive to investor sentiment are those of companies that are smaller, more volatile, have less tangible assets, are unprofitable, are distressed, and have the potential for extreme growth. at first, i construct the monthly sentiment index and the monthly index of sentiment changes for the korean stock market based on principal component analysis using five key sentiment proxies: the volatility premium, kse share turnover, ipo volume, ipo first-day returns, and the proportion of companies with seasonal equity offering. to increase the reliability of the indices and their comparability with international research, i develop these sentiment indices in line with those of baker and wurgler (2006, 2007). using these indices and the monthly returns of all of the common stocks of the kospi market from 2000 to 2017, i analyze the effect of the changes in investor sentiment on a cross-section of stock returns. i start by forming equal-weighted decile portfolios based on several firm characteristics such as firm size, mtb, idiosyncratic volatility, total volatility, asset tangibility, profitability, sales growth, and rand d ratio, and look for patterns in changes in average returns across deciles when the investor sentiment index changes from +1σ to -1σ. i also consider a regression approach that allows controlling for the fama-french (1993) factors and the carhart (1997) momentum factor. i regress the returns of each decile portfolio and the returns of various high-minus-low portfolios on the index of sentiment changes, respectively. consistent with my prediction, i find that the stocks with high mtb ratio, high volatility, low ppe ratio, low profitability, and low sales growth, respond more sensitively to changes in investor sentiment than the stocks with low mtb ratio, low volatility, high ppe ratio, high profitability, and high sales growth. in other words, the more speculative and harder-to-arbitrage stocks have higher sentiment betas. the returns of stocks with extremely low mtb ratios and low volatilities are negatively related to changes in sentiment. that is, most bond-like stocks appear to have slightly negative sentiment betas. these findings are consistent with those of prior studies. as the korean stock market is an individual-crowded and highly integrated market, it is a good test bed for studying issues related to investor sentiment. using korean stock market data, my findings shed light on the effect of investor sentiment on a cross-section of stock returns in theory and can help practitioners establish a profitable investment strategy using investor sentiment. © 2020, korean finance association. all rights reserved."
"we offer a new three-factor asset-pricing model for country equity returns. the model accommodates a broad set of country-level cross-sectional anomalies better than the popular capm, three-factor model, and four-factor model. furthermore, it fully explains the performance of other models’ factors, while the standard models are not able to explain the alphas of their factors. the new model relies on the country-level portfolios formed based on the ebitda-to-ev ratio and on skewness-enhanced momentum. these factor portfolios provide reliable and robust sources of return, and their performance is consistent with the behavioral finance mispricing interpretation. this study is based on the accounting and price data from 78 country equity markets in 1995–2015. © springer nature switzerland ag 2020."
"risk-taking behavior can result in a range of maladaptive behaviors such as illicit substance use, unsafe driving, and high-risk sexual behavior. perception of risk and preference for engaging in risky behaviors have been measured using both self-report measures and a range of behavioral tasks designed for the purpose, and these may predict future risk-taking behavior. however, the interrelationships between these measures and the latent constructs underlying them are poorly understood. in the present study, we examined data from over 1,000 men and women who completed measures of risk-related behaviors, including self-reports of perception of risk, propensity to engage in risky behaviors, and incentivized performance on tasks that involve risk. we conducted principal component analyses (pcas) to understand the underlying latent structure of these measures. a pca with the full sample revealed 5 distinct components, corresponding to measures of (a) health/ethical risks, (b) discounting of uncertain rewards, (c) risk of personal finances, (d) preferences in recreational hobbies and social interactions that involve risk, and (e) behavior involving risks in interpersonal interactions. although we found sex differences on several of the measures, the sex-adjusted pca components were similar to those of the unadjusted full sample pca. these findings add to a growing literature revealing different components of the broad category of risk perception and risk-taking behaviors. a better understanding of the multidimensionality of risk preference will help lay the foundation for more refined measures, develop better predictors of future risk-taking behavior, and ultimately to study the genetic or other biological basis of risk-taking. © 2019 american psychological association."
"will financial advisors continue to be relevant as financial firms and investors increasingly embrace newer technologies and channels for trading? this study examines this question; we ask if financial advisors can help to reduce investors' gambling preference, and the role of online channel in attenuating or amplifying this effect. our results of analyzing data on roughly 20,000 investors with more than 450,000 monthly observations suggest that investors who interact with financial advisors in a given month have 2.36% lower holdings of lottery-like securities. importantly, we also find that interaction with financial advisors reduces investors' gambling preference even more when investors heavily rely on internet for transactions. these findings drawing on literature at the intersection of information systems and behavioral finance and a rare dataset provide useful insights for investors and financial services firms. © icis 2020. all rights reserved."
"evolving globalization has made south african banks more efficient and more diverse, giving them the chance to capture new opportunities. however, as banks extend their global reach and grasp these new opportunities, more risk is attached. advances in technology and the radical spur of social media have changed the man-ner and speed with which information flows. depositors base their perceptions (sub-jective in nature) of a bank on recent information (from various sources) and have the power to ensure or erode the continuity of a bank. depositor intentions may differ based on their demographics, perception, risk tolerance level or the behavioral finance biases toward which they are subject. however, research is limited when considering how depositors react to risk based on different sources of information. therefore, the objective of this paper is to identify whether depositors’ intentions to withdraw funds during operational risk events differ based on the source of infor-mation. the top three sources of information as chosen by depositors are television broadcasts, printed media and online media. independent t-tests are performed based on whether depositors chose a particular source of information or not. depositors will react differently (ie, will be more likely to withdraw funds) when hearing about internal fraud; faulty clients, products or business practices; or damage to physical assets and reputational events from printed media rather than from other sources of information. concerning depositors’ intentions to withdraw during operational risk events, depositors will not act any differently when hearing about these events from a television broadcast or online media. the novelty of this research paper hinges on the contribution of whether operational events influence depositors’ decisions and which forms of communication channel should be used by banks when building their rep-utations to mitigate the negative consequences of operational events or to manage a crisis. © 2020 infopro digital risk (ip) limited."
"the existence of a large number of ""anomalies"" in the financial market makes the traditional efficient market hypothesis theory face challenges, and has become one of the hot issues in academic research. for this reason, researchers can only seek a new theoretical framework to explain this problem, thereby promoting the emergence and development of behavioral finance. behavioral finance shows a strong ability to explain market anomalies, such as asset price bubbles and crashes, peaks and troughs, leverage effect and long memory, and it is increasingly favored by scholars, thus becoming a financial market analysis mainstream paradigm. ""bounded rationality"" and ""trader heterogeneity"" are the two core assumptions of behavioral finance theory. the latter means that different traders in the market will adopt different trading strategies based on market information. traders holding the different type of trading strategies are pooled together to form the micro-foundation of price movement and contribute to the dynamic behavior of asset prices. this paper considers the pricing behavior when heterogeneous traders face circumstances uncertainty. in the face of uncertain circumstances, fundamental traders and chartist traders choose and switch between the two strategies based on their own private information and public information to maximize their own utility, and promote prices dynamic evolution therefore it has also led to the dynamic and endogenous changes in the proportion of fundamental traders and chartist traders in the market and the formation of the micro-foundation of asset price movements. heterogeneous traders come together to interact not only to explain many statistical features of financial time series, but also to explain macro-emerging phenomena such as bubbles or crashes. the main work and conclusions of the full text are as follows: first, a heterogeneous trader pricing model with uncertain information is established. each trader can choose and switch between the basic trading strategy and the technical trading strategy. the pricing process of the basic transaction is determined by the trader's private information, and the pricing process of the technical transaction is determined by the market public information. traders formulate trading strategies based on their private and public information in pursuit of maximizing utility. traders holding different trading strategies interact to drive stock price fluctuations endogenously. second, a simulation study was conducted on the model, and the effectiveness of the model was verified by observing the output. in order to verify whether the statistical data generated by the model and the real market data have similar statistical characteristics, this paper uses the shanghai and shenzhen 300 stock index sequence data as a sample from january 1, 2006 to december 21, 2015 to pricing model based on heterogeneous traders. the results of model calibration show that there is a high degree of fit between the output and the real data. the constructed heterogeneous trader pricing model can better present the statistical characteristics of real data in financial markets, including peaks and troughs, volatility aggregation, leverage effects, and power law distribution characteristics of tail. in particular, the short-term and long-term stock price characteristics of financial time series are studied, especially the long-memory process and the long-range dependence. the above results indicate that the model can explain the characteristics of financial time series endogenously, and it has good robustness. third, we perform sensitivity analysis on the key parameters of the model and observe its impact on the output results. especially we observe the influence of the fundamental trader participation degree parameter and chartist trader participation degree parameter on the model output results. the results show that the former has little effect on the degree of volatility aggregation. the decay characteristic of the autocorrelation function is more obviously affected by the latter, indicating that the degree of volatility aggregation is significantly affected by the parameter of the degree of participation of chartist traders. the bigger the parameter, the larger of influence of asset price due to participation of chartist traders. the degree of aggregation has also increased. it can be considered that the trading behavior of chartist traders is the main source of market volatility. the research in this paper expands and innovates on behavioral finance, especially the theories and methods related to pricing of heterogeneous traders. in future research, we can consider a broader definition and description of trader behavior, so as to more effectively characterize the complex system behavior emerging from the micro-individual interaction of the financial market. © 2020. all rights reserved."

"capital gains tax on securities in taiwan was resubmitted in mar 2012 and reimplement from jan 2013, but this taxation suffered the huge public pressure in the society and caused the decline of stock trading volume and finally abolished on the end of 2015. this study intends to combine behavioral finance and tax neutrality principle base on lewin field theory to investigate whether investors’ psychology, investors’ behavior and the outer environment could be interact affected by taxation in taiwan stock market. the empirical results have shown as follows: (1) investor psychological impact-overreaction (gjr model): the taxation announcements (bad news) would affect investors into irrational bias and due to decrease original profit for investor would amplify the negative asymmetrical volatility in return rate of stock. (2) investor behavior impact- lock-in effect (clrm and did model): in a long term, the trading volume of hong kong stock market has been back to normal after the extension period to dilute other interference effect. however, the stock trading volume in taiwan still has a 19.64% decrease comparing to that in hong kong. such result indicates due to the taxation substitution effects, investors would shift their investment to other low-tax or free-tax goods.

"studies show us that women face more difficulties in business (management, accounting, finance, behavioral sciences and people management) than their male counterparts because of stereotypical considerations about their role, which have negative consequences on opportunities on the workplace. so, leadership emerges in this research with a reinforced role and as a crucial way in supporting marketing management (specifically the case of communication and advertising) and in its relation to sexism and gender equality. it is necessary to understand to what extent the media and the advertising industry influences the stereotypes that will dictate the rise or not of female leadership. the present work aims to contribute, theoretically, to the understanding of this phenomenon, gathering some of the main contributions of the existent literature. future studies should lead researchers to empirically test the role of leadership in shaping organizations' communication policies and plans (specifically, promoting gender equality). in an interdisciplinary perspective, this study intends to contribute to marketing and to organizational behavior. future work will help to the elaboration of a focus group and in-depth interviews bringing together some decision-making agents (in the company's perspective) and consumers (from a demand perspective). © 2020 universidade estadual de maringa."
"financial products recommendation distinguishes itself from e-commerce and web recommendation. financial products have fewer available items, are more expensive, less frequently purchased and subject to user specific constraints. the study in financial products recommendation is quite limited and current industry application is still focusing on exploiting machine learning techniques. behavioral finance theory states financial decisions are affected by psychological behavior biases, which are generally identified via conversation with professional advisors. besides, in a conversation customer actively express subjective requirements and interests, which cannot be known from their static structured data. inspired by that, we propose an innovative heterogeneous conversational recommender system (hconvonet) which will consider not only customer’s static profile but also the implicit behavior biases and interests, thus is adaptive to customer. the proposed framework consists of two modules: profile module and conversation module. the profile module aims to capture customer’s important static needs, while the conversation module aims to extract behavior biases and dynamic interests. by integrating profile module and conversation module, hconvonet can recommend financial products in an adaptive way. the experiments are conducted on three internal datasets from ping an insurance and try to predict customer’s purchase intention. we compare our model with several baselines and see that our proposed model has a significant improvement. copyright © 2019 for this paper by its authors. use permitted under creative commons license attribution 4.0 international (cc by 4.0)."

"with growing adoption of ai across fields such as healthcare, finance, and the justice system, explaining an ai decision has become more important than ever before. development of human-centric explainable ai (xai) systems necessitates an understanding of the requirements of the human-in-the-loop seeking the explanation. this includes the cognitive behavioral purpose that the explanation serves for its recipients, and the structure that the explanation uses to reach those ends. an understanding of the psychological foundations of explanations is thus vital for the development of effective human-centric xai systems. towards this end, we survey papers from the cognitive science literature that address the following broad questions: (1) what is an explanation, (2) what are explanations for, and 3) what are the characteristics of good and bad explanations. we organize the insights gained therein by means of highlighting the advantages and shortcomings of various explanation structures and theories, discuss their applicability across different domains, and analyze their utility to various types of humans-in-the-loop. we summarize the key takeaways for human-centric design of xai systems, and recommend strategies to bridge the existing gap between xai research and practical needs. we hope this work will spark the development of novel human-centric xai systems. © 2020 inst. sci. inf., univ. defence in belgrade. all rights reserved."

"the efficient-market hypothesis (emh) is one of the most important economic and financial hypotheses that have been tested over the past century. due to many abnormal phenomena and conflicting evidence, otherwise known as anomalies against emh, some academics have questioned whether emh is valid, and pointed out that the financial literature has substantial evidence of anomalies, so that many theories have been developed to explain some anomalies. to address the issue, this paper reviews the theory and literature on market efficiency and market anomalies. we give a brief review on market efficiency and clearly define the concept of market efficiency and the emh. we discuss some efforts that challenge the emh. we review different market anomalies and different theories of behavioral finance that could be used to explain such market anomalies. this review is useful to academics for developing cutting-edge treatments of financial theory that emh, anomalies, and behavioral finance underlie. the review is also beneficial to investors for making choices of investment products and strategies that suit their risk preferences and behavioral traits predicted from behavioral models. finally, when emh, anomalies and behavioral finance are used to explain the impacts of investor behavior on stock price movements, it is invaluable to policy makers, when reviewing their policies, to avoid excessive fluctuations in stock markets. © 2020 by the authors."
"this study investigates strategic aspect of leverage-driven bubbles from the viewpoint of game theory and behavioral finance. even if a company is unproductive, its stock price grows up according to an exogenous reinforcement pattern. during the bubble, this company raises huge funds by issuing new shares. multiple arbitrageurs strategically decide whether to ride the bubble by continuing to purchase shares through leveraged finance. we demonstrate two models that are distinguished by whether crash-contingent claim, i. e. contractual agreement such that the purchaser of this claim receives a promised monetary amount if and only if the bubble crashes, is available. we show that the availability of this claim deters the bubble; without crash-contingent claim, the bubble emerges and persists long even if the degree of reinforcement is insufficient. without crash-contingent claim, high leverage ratio fosters the bubble, while with crash-contingent claim, it rather deters the bubble. we formulate these models as specifications of timing game with irrational types; each player selects a time in a fixed time interval, and the player who selects the earliest time wins the game. we assume that each player is irrational with a small but positive probability. we then prove that there exists the unique nash equilibrium; according to it, every player never selects the initial time. by regarding arbitrageurs as players, we give careful conceptualizations that are necessary to interpret timing games as models of leverage-driven bubbles. © 2019 walter de gruyter gmbh, berlin/boston."

"purpose: the purpose of this article is to clarify the mechanism by which underconfidence heuristic-driven bias influences the short-term and long-term investment decisions of individual investors, actively trading on the pakistan stock exchange. design/methodology/approach: investors' underconfidence has been measured using a questionnaire, comprising numerous items, including indicators of short-term and long-term investment decision. in order to establish the influence of underconfidence on the investment decisions in both the short and long run, a 5-point likert scale questionnaire has been used to collect data from the sample of 203 investors. the collected data were analyzed using spss and amos graphics software. hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling technique. findings: this article provides further empirical insights into the relationship between heuristic-driven biases and investment decision-making in the short and long run. the results suggest that underconfidence bias has a markedly negative influence on the short-term and long-term decisions made by investors in developing markets. it means that heuristic-driven biases can impair the quality of both short-term and long-term investment decisions. practical implications: this article encourages investors to avoid relying on cognitive heuristics, namely, underconfidence or their feelings when making short-term and long-term investment strategies. it provides awareness and understanding of heuristic-driven biases in investment management, which could be very useful for finance practitioners' such as investor who plays at the stock exchange, a portfolio manager, a financial strategist/advisor in an investment firm, a financial planner, an investment banker, a trader/broker at the stock exchange or a financial analyst. but most importantly, the term also includes all those persons who manage corporate entities and are responsible for making its financial management strategies. they can improve the quality of their decision-making by recognizing their behavioral biases and errors of judgment, to which we are all prone, resulting in more appropriate investment strategies. originality/value: the current study is the first to focus on links between underconfidence bias and short-term and long-term investment decision-making. this article enhanced the understanding of the role that heuristic-driven bias plays in the investment management and more importantly, it went some way toward enhancing understanding of behavioral aspects and their influence on the investment decision-making in an emerging market. it also adds to the literature in the area of behavioral finance specifically the role of heuristics in investment strategies; this field is in its initial stage, even in developed countries, while, in developing countries, little work has been done. © 2020, emerald publishing limited."

"in this paper, we present an agent-based model (abm) of multi-dimensional transportation choices for individuals and firms given anticipated aggregate traveler demand patterns. conventional finance, economic and policy evaluation techniques have already been widely adopted to more evidenced based decision-making process with the aim to understand the financial, economic and social impacts on transportation choices. prior scholars have examined common practices used to measure profitability for investment appraisal including internal rate of return (irr), net present value (npv) and risk analysis approaches, incorporating the concepts of time value of money and uncertainty to assess potential financial gains with different transportation projects. however, using conventional capital budget planning or static scenario analysis alone cannot capture significant, interactive and nonlinear project, demand and market uncertainties. here we build an agent-based model on the current california high-speed rail (hsr) to provide insights into firm investment decisions from a computational finance perspective, given the coupling of individual choices, aggregate social demand, and government policy and tax incentives. given individual level choice and behavioral aspects, we combine financial accounting and economic theory to identify more precise marginal revenue streams and project profitability over time to help mitigate both project and potential, system market risk. © 2020, springer nature switzerland ag."
"studies on behavioral finance argue that cognitive/emotional biases could influence investors’ decisions and result in the disposition effect, wherein investors have the tendency to sell winning stocks too early and hold losing stocks too long. in this regard, this study proposes a conceptual model to examine the relationship among cognitive/emotional biases, the disposition effect, and investment performance. cognitive/emotional biases mainly consist of mental accounting, regret avoidance, and self-control. furthermore, this study examines whether gender and marital status moderate the relationship between these biases and the disposition effect by collecting quantitative data through a questionnaire survey and employing a structural equation modeling (sem) approach to execute the estimation procedure. the results of this study show that mental accounting has the most significant influence on the disposition effect, which implies that prospect theory is an alternative to expected utility theory in accounting for investor’s behavior. the findings of moderating analysis indicate that female investors display a larger disposition effect than male investors. © 2021 by world scientific publishing co. pte. ltd."
"studies noticed that individuals’ cognitive, psychological, and behavioral limitations always have some influence in their everyday decision making. and the financial decisions are no exceptions. perhaps it can be affirmed that individual financial decisions do have cognitive influence. this is also true with the indian households. this study has briefly identified one such component i.e. mental accounting system and has explored the presence of mental accounting influence in households’ financial decisions. the study also establishes mental accounting as a second-order construct by using a hierarchical latent variable model. partial least square structural equation model (pls-sem) has been used to analyze and validate the scales. the analysis has been done with 452 responses collected using a survey method through a structured questionnaire given to indian households. the study essentially analyses the influence of mental accounting in the financial decisions of households. this study aims at extending the knowledge of behavioral finance among the scholars of consumer behavior and personal finance, as well as the financial service providers. © 2020 the author(s). this open access article is distributed under a creative commons attribution (cc-by) 4.0 license."

"parental psychosocial stress and its impact on the health of parents and their children is a growing field of research. however, to date, the association between psychosocial stress in parents and mental health problems in children and adolescents has not been sufficiently studied in germany. the analysis is based on data from the first follow-up of the ""german health interview and examination survey for children and adolescents"" (kiggs wave 1) carried out by the robert koch institute from 2009 to 2012. the study sample comprised 10,891 children and adolescents aged 3-17 years. in our analysis we used information given by the parents in a telephone interview. first, the prevalence rates for 13 different types of parent-rated psychosocial stress related to family, work, finances, and everyday life were calculated. second, differences in the prevalence for emotional and behavioral problems in children and adolescents of stressed and nonstressed parents were analyzed. emotional and behavioral problems were measured via the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (sdq) and defined as high according to a combined symptom and impact score. using binary logistic regression, the association between parental stress and mental health problems in children and adolescents was analyzed adjusting for various family factors (e. g., the socioeconomic status of the family, unemployment of the parents, family structure, age of the parents, number and age of the siblings, and family cohesion). one quarter of parents reported feeling stressed overall. parents with mental illnesses, single parents, as well as families with a low socioeconomic status were affected by psychosocial stress to a great extent. the descriptive analysis revealed differences in the emotional and behavioral problems in children and adolescents between stressed and nonstressed parents with regard to each stressor. in the fully adjusted models, an association between parental psychosocial stress and emotional and behavioral problems in children and adolescents was observed for 11 out of 13 stressors and for the overall stressor. in these cases, stressed parents are more likely to have a child with emotional or behavioral problems than parents without psychosocial stress. the odds ratios ranged between 1.62 (95 % ci: 0.89-2.96) and 10.30 (95 % ci: 7.25-14.64) depending on the type of stress. the association can be explained only partly by the family variables considered. including all stressors in one model, the strongest associations with emotional and behavioral problems in children and adolescents were found for parenting problems, continual commitment to the family, and financial worries. preventive measures to reduce psychosocial stress among parents hold potential for improving the mental health of children. special attention should be given to single parents, parents with mental illnesses, and families with a low socioeconomic status. © 2020 hogrefe verlag."
"purpose of the study: this study traces the evolution of analytical methods in building finance theory with a view to strike an ‘optimal’ balance between the analytical rigour and the real-world inferential insights. methodology: the theoretical developments in the latter half of the 20th century, in the field of finance, have focused, extensively, on the analytical basis of sound theory building and its empirical validation using the statistical tools. the pioneering work of miller and modigliani that analytically established the relationship between the firm’s financial leverage (debt component) and the value of the firm, under varying assumptions marked the beginning of analytical approaches to building finance theory. the corporate bankruptcy model developed by altman was also studied. the subsequent empirical studies have also been examined to assess the practical validity and relevance of their findings. main findings: a) while the analytical modelling, by virtue of its elegance of logic and causation, has been widely acclaimed as the most efficient tool of theory building, it is beset with certain inherent limitations. more specifically, the field of social sciences, which includes several functional areas of management, is intrinsically determined by behavioral factors and therefore, the stand-alone mathematical modelling (that overlooks the ‘unpredictability’ of behavioral parameters) is fraught with the danger of erroneous conclusions. b) the behavioral parameters are, in turn, determined by the psycho-sociological, ethnic, geographic and other factors; this makes the ‘analytical’ handling of the behavioral parameters more cumbersome and therefore inefficient. c) the ‘percolation’ of statistical analysis into conceptually deterministic models has blurred the researcher’s distinction between the stochastic and deterministic (tautological) models thereby, resulting in ‘proving’ the obvious. d) finally, the article concludes with the observation that the utility of mathematical modelling can be enhanced by articulating the broad contours of causal relationships among the various parameter so as to gain tangible insights into the real-life decision situations and also by suitably modifying the rigidities of the model to suit the ‘nuances’ of the specific situation. in other words, the researcher should stress more on the ‘spirit’ of the model as opposed to its elegantly framed ‘structure’ of equations. applications of this study: this study is expected to make the finance researchers to focus on the inferential insights into the ‘quantitative’ parameters emerging from the analytical models so as to enhance the utility of analytical methods employed in finance. © iaeme publication."

"this engaging book offers a primer on stocks and bonds, using easy-to-understand language to explain how they function and why they are important. it will be a valuable resource for both economics students and readers interested in investing. although news outlets provide daily updates on stock market performance, many americans have little understanding of how stocks and stock exchanges work. yet stocks, along with government and corporate bonds, represent two key cornerstones of modern economics. while the average american may think of them as simply two types of investments, stocks and bonds have impacts on the economy that go far beyond the realm of personal finance. the latest volume in greenwood's new student guides to business and economics series, stocks and bonds gives readers an in-depth yet reader-friendly look at these integral components of the u.s. and global economy. it explores the different types of bonds, how stocks and stock exchanges work, and why periodic crashes and crises occur. it explains fundamental concepts such as risk versus return, interest rates, and behavioral economics, using real-world examples to illustrate key points. it also provides practical tried-and-true recommendations for investing in stocks and bonds. © 2020 by abc-clio, llc. all rights reserved."
"based on a database of u.s. electric utility rate cases spanning nearly four decades, the returns on equity authorized by regulators have exhibited a large and growing premium over the riskless rate of return. this growing premium does not appear to be explained by traditional asset-pricing models, often in direct contrast to regulators’ stated intent. we suggest possible alternative explanations drawn from finance, public policy, public choice, and the behavioral economics literature. however, absent some normative justification for this premium, it would appear that regulators are authorizing excessive returns on equity to utility investors and that these excess returns translate into tangible profits for utility firms. © 2019 elsevier ltd"
"from the perspective of communication science and combining with the research results of behavioral finance, this paper analyzes the diffusion mechanism of investor scare behavior, and constructs a network diffusion model of investor scare behavior with the help of complex network theory. also, it theoretically analyzes the network topological characteristics of investor scare behavior diffusion and the evolution characteristics of it in numerical simulation. the main conclusions are as follows: (1) in local financial network, the probability of investor scare behavior diffusion shows the characteristic of monotone diminishing with the increase of media attention and media sentiment, while it shows the characteristics of monotone increasing with the increase of media authority. but it is gradually disappearing in global financial network. besides, it presents the rising trend of marginal increasing with the increase of financial market noise and information dissemination ability of media in local and global financial networks. (2) when the financial market noise interacts with media sentiment, media attention, media authority and information dissemination ability of media respectively, the probability of investor scare behavior diffusion shows the characteristic of monotone increasing in both local and global financial networks. (3) when media sentiment interacts with media attention and media authority respectively, the probability of investor scare behavior diffusion shows the characteristic of monotone diminishing and the characteristics of monotone increasing respectively in local financial network. while it shows the characteristics of monotone increasing in local financial network when media attention interacts with media authority © 2019"
"corporate finance literature reports a positive association between the cultural dimension of individualism and firm risk-taking, assuming that national culture directly affects the decision-making of corporate executives (tough guy hypothesis). in contrast, studies that link individualism and risk-taking at the individual level find that individuals in collectivistic societies tend to take greater risks (cushion hypothesis). these findings are difficult to reconcile since both strands of literature have important limitations. while findings from corporate finance literature might be not robust to alternative explanations, behavioral finance studies rely on a small number of countries in their respective samples. this study contributes to the second strand of literature by testing the prediction of cushion hypothesis on the individual-level data from three different sources that cover 25, 49, and 41 countries respectively. the cumulative evidence indicates that, consistent with the cushion hypothesis, the link between the individualism and risk-taking is negative. © 2019 elsevier b.v."
"purpose: the paper takes a behavioral approach by making use of the prospect theory to unveil the impact of salience on short-term and long-term investment decisions. this paper aims to investigate the group differences for two types of investors’ groups, i.e. individual investors and professional investors. design/methodology/approach: the study uses partial least square-based structural equation modeling technique, measurement invariance test and multigroup analysis test on a unique data set of 277 active equity traders which included professional money managers and individual investors. findings: results showed that salience has a significant positive impact on both short-term and long-term investment decisions. the impact was almost 1.5 times higher for long-term investment decision as compared to short-term decision. furthermore, multigroup analysis revealed that the two groups (individual investors and professional investors) were statistically significantly different from each other. research limitations/implications: the study has implications for financial regulators, money managers and individual investors as it was found that individual investors suffer more with salience heuristic and may end up with sub-optimal portfolios due to inefficient diversification. thus, investors should be cautious in fully relying on salience and avoid such bias to improve investment returns. practical implications: the study concludes with a discussion of policy and regulatory implications on how to minimize salience bias to achieve optimum and diversified portfolios. originality/value: the study has significantly contributed to the growing body of applied behavioral research in the discipline of finance. © 2018, emerald publishing limited."
"following recent developments linking poverty to present-bias behavior, we conduct an optimal linear taxation analysis where some individuals (called “behaviorals”) have a discount factor that is a function of their disposable income. in the model, endogenous discount factors imply (1) that taxing labor decreases the valuation of savings and (2) that subsidies on savings mitigate for a lower weight being given to future consumption. we perform simulations where the number of behavioral individuals increases and find that resources raised through labor taxation are used to finance saving subsidies rather than an increase of transfers. the prevalence of behaviorals leads to an increase in the labor income tax rate. © the author(s) 2019."

"the growing gap between standard finance theory and practice has made way for the emergence of new theories and the development of new asset-pricing models. behavioral economists have seized this opportunity to promote their ideas and thus develop behavioral finance theory, as an antithesis to standard finance theory; behavioral portfolio theory, as an antithesis to modern portfolio theory, and a behavioral asset-pricing model, as an antithesis to standard financial asset-pricing models. the paper aims to illustrate these new theoretical frameworks, given the absence of research at the national level relating to behavioral portfolio theory and the behavioral asset-pricing model. the objective is to explain the key features of behavioral portfolio theory and the behavioral asset-pricing model by means of conducting a comparative analysis of the mentioned theory and its model and standard financial concepts and models. by using a qualitative research methodology, the author concludes that, by incorporating psychological factors, behavioral portfolio theory and the behavioral asset-pricing model complement conventional financial concepts and bring finance theory closer to reality. it is, however, still too early and exaggerated to a certain extent to speak about the superiority of these new theoretical frameworks in relation to modern portfolio theory and conventional asset-pricing models, which is also the main finding of the research study. © ekonomski fakultet univerziteta u kragujevcu."
"finland, a prosperous nordic country with a population of 5.5 million and significant distances between towns, though quite short distances traveled by car, is aiming to be a carbon-neutral society by 2035. due to the level of urgency, a technological pathway with decarbonization of fuels and innovation only, is unlikely to be sufficient. instead, a more systemic change based on a transformative pathway with demand-side management, i.e., measures based on behavioral change, is vital. in this research we were interested in learning how life satisfaction relates to the behavioral intentions of finnish citizens, regarding a sustainable modal shift. we focused on walking, cycling, public transport and reduction in car use, e.g., a transition from fossil fuels to active mobility, from ownership to usership. data were collected via a questionnaire in april 2017. the respondents (n = 2052) provided 2335 comments as to why they considered a specific sustainable modality as being important to them. we applied both qualitative and quantitative methods in order to establish how the mobility behavior of citizens manifests nationwide and the types of arguments that citizens put forward concerning their mobility intentions. the results indicate that there is a strong relationship between the respondents' reduced use of private cars and their life satisfaction. there is a concern about sustainability and a willingness to change current mobility practices, as well as signs of altruism, while hedonic concerns such as health and personal finances dominate the responses. furthermore, concerns about social injustice, such as a lack of public transport, are emerging themes, i.e., when enacting mobility transitions it is vital to focus on how to enable a meaningful life for all demographic groups using suitable mobility services. © 2019 by the authors."
"public-private partnership (ppp) has been an effective and economic method for delivering environmental protection and urban projects. ppp has been widely adopted in project finance in developing countries such as china, in which environmental projects occupy the third largest number of projects. however, it is not possible to prepare a “perfect” contract accounting for all situations and uncertainties during the entire life cycle of a project. this will inevitably result in the renegotiation of the contract, with the circumstances and causes varying greatly from country to country. environmental protection and urban projects are usually related to people's livelihoods; thus, the frequent occurrences of renegotiations may result in increased costs, reduced management efficiency or even poor performance of projects. hence, game theory is applied in this paper to tackle the problem of ppp renegotiations in the context of environmental and urban projects in china, with the goal of pursuing the successful application of urban multiparty ppp projects. the two-player bargaining game model and the multiplayer coalitional game model are both proposed to model the renegotiation processes, and equilibrium solutions and implications are then derived. finally, the performance of the model is verified with an example, the sewage disposal ppp project in erhai lake, to examine cooperation surplus allocation. this methodology gives clarity to the analysis of the behavioral dynamics of stakeholders in ppp projects and could facilitate rational and cautious decision making by participants. the study can also provide theoretical foundations for policy makers on the effective implementation of ppp procurement and management in the environmental and urban governance industry. © 2019 elsevier ltd"

"behavioral finance explains that cognitive biases influences investor decision making. due to the influence of different behavioral biases investors do tend to make irrational decisions. behavioral finance has highlighted the failure of traditional finance theories to account for human emotions when making investment decisions. while traditional finance theories disregard human element in decision-making, behavioral finance theories take into account the human phycology while explaining theories. many studies have found and explained many biases that are exhibited by investors which lead to irrational investment decision making on their part. one among the many the biases herding can be considered among the most important behavior which leads to low quality investment decisions by investors. while compared to studies about herd behavior of institutional investors, the studies about individual retail investors in less. the motive behind this study is to clarify the role of demographic factors and psychological factors that influence herd behavior among individual investors. in this study the impact of demographics and psychological factors on herd behavior was studied. for this survey, primary data was collected using judgment sampling technique and the results analyzed. retail investors in chennai exhibited herd behavior with regard to investment decisions. eight factors were found to influence herd behavior. © beiesp."

"the driving force for the comovement in stock returns is a long-standing debate between classical asset pricing theory and behavioral finance theory. it has become critically important recently for understanding systemic risk and risk contagion in the market. in this study, we propose complex networks enabled new methods to measure the causal comovement of individual stocks and the comovement structure of the market, which facilitate the examination of all kinds of hypotheses of comovement theories in a unified framework. using a sample of the chinese stock market from jan. 1, 2006 to dec. 31, 2016, we find that the degree of comovement generally intensifies over time, with a drastic increase from 2011 to 2015, while the comovement structure of the market changes with different market situations. most importantly, our study reveals the driving force of causal comovement among individual stocks; that is, sentiment-based factors related to the market index indeed induce excess causal comovement in returns beyond that can be justified by fundamental factors including beta coefficient, book-to-market ratio, liquidity, profitability and volatility. our study also reveals the determinants of comovement structure, which are attributable to the change of investors' behaviors in different periods. it turns out that investors in the chinese stock market care about risk-return relationship in normal periods, while they seem to care only about risk in crisis periods. © 2019 elsevier b.v."
"recently, the trade conflict between the united states and china has become an international area of interest and a hot topic. this study wants to investigate the impacts of trade conflicts on both countries' stock markets. this research measures the changes in stock market prices from the perspective of behavioral finance. after eliminating the influence of macroeconomics through its representative indicators, this paper constructs an index reflecting investor sentiment using the principal component analysis. this work builds a regression model considering investor sentiment and the intensity of trade conflicts. the results show that there is an asymmetric influence of chinese investor sentiment on the performance of the stock market. comparatively, u.s. investor sentiment has a weaker impact on market performance. in order to denote the intensity of trade conflicts, this paper collects the frequencies of trade conflicts from newspapers and google trends. we find that trade conflicts have negative impacts on both stock markets and their major industries. among the four selected industries, the market performance of the chinese manufacturing industry was the most affected among all by trade conflicts, while the most affected market in the u.s. was the scientific research industry. this indicates that in the currently globalized field of production, the supply chains of the two countries are highly connected and raising tariffs will adversely affect the performance of industries in which the two countries are tightly correlated. in addition, this paper predicts the stock prices and returns of both stock markets in the future based on ito's process. the results show that the stock performances with high trade conflict intensity behaves badly compared to those with low intensity. © 2019 ieee."
"with the rapid development of chinese commodity futures markets and the financialization problem during recent times, there are lots of price rises and drops which can be described as herd behavior in our commodity futures market. herd behavior and its impact on futures returns are attractive topics in behavioral finance. the basic motivation of this project is to study the interactions between herd behavior and futures returns. various models are implemented to analysis the herd behavior. we find that there exists significant herd behavior in metal future market and the financialization can aggravates the herd behavior. however, there is no obvious herd behavior in agricultural futures market. © 2019 ieee."
"equity markets play a pivotal role in the sustainability of developing countries, such as china. the literature on the detection of herding biases is confined to the aggregate level (firms, sector/industry and market). the present study adds to the behavioral finance literature by addressing the surprisingly unnoticed phenomena of the behavioral impact of herding bias on firm value (fv) at the firm level, using the sample of a-shares listed firms at the shanghai and shenzhen stock exchanges (sse and szse) under panel fixed effect specification. initially, we detect the existence of investors and managers herding (ihr and mhr) biases at firm-level, and later, we examine their impact (distinct and interactive) upon the fv. the empirical results document the presence of ihr and mhr bias at market, sector and firm-level in both equity markets, which potentially drive the fv, while the impact is more pronounced during the extreme trading period. the findings are robust under different time intervals, and industry classification, therefore, offers useful policy implications to understand the behavioral dynamics of investors and managers. © 2019 by the authors."
"behavioral finance research presents evidence of the importance of “anomaly factors” in the stock market. in this article, we develop an individual stock cash inflow–outflow imbalance index based on individual stock cash inflow and cash outflow and further examine the combined effects of individual stock cash inflow–outflow imbalance and individual stock investor sentiment on excess returns. our results show that the combined effect of individual stock cash inflow–outflow imbalance and individual stock investor sentiment on excess returns is stronger positive relation. furthermore, we find that increasing individual stock cash inflow will increase excess returns; on the contrary, increasing individual stock cash outflow will decrease excess returns. overall, our results highlight the importance of individual stock cash inflow, cash out flow, and cash inflow–outflow imbalance on asset pricing. ©, copyright © taylor & francis group, llc."
"this study investigates two issues pertinent to managerial overconfidence (hereafter, moc) and risk-taking from the perspective of behavioral corporate finance: (1) does moc influence the relationship between corporate risk-taking and firm value? (2) can the effects of moc be moderated through certain internal and external governance or personal factors? using the kospi for non-financial firms from 2002 to 2015, this study examines the issues by identifying the firms with moc from the measurement variables that are related to both the determinants and outcome of moc. the main findings are as follows. first, firms with overconfident managers tend to experience lower firm value compared to those with non-overconfident managers because of their inappropriate or excessive risk-taking behavior. this finding suggests that in addition to agency problems, moc can have negative effects on the relationship between risk-taking and firm value in korean firms. second, there are no significant internal or external governance control effects, such as outside directors’ control over obligations, a sound board of directors, the control of chaebols, a less-competitive indus-try, and less economic policy uncertainty over the negative effects of moc, on the relation-ship between risk-taking and firm value. in contrast, the negative effects of moc turn weak in terms of personal factors when the managers become older. these results show that con-trolling for the negative effects of moc through internal or external governance mechanisms is not easy, even though these mechanisms may be helpful to control for the agency problem in korean firms. nevertheless, the results confirm that the effects of moc depend on managers’ personal traits. this study shows that managers should be wary of their own overconfidence and restrain themselves from making irrational decisions. furthermore, this study suggests that the board of directors needs to react against moc and improve the board’s control over moc in order to avoid its negative effects. © 2019, korean securities association. all rights reserved."

"inclusive finance is an important development direction in the future of finance. the development of inclusive finance in china's rural areas has provided valuable experience as well as exposing the various limitations of sustainable development. one of the key reasons for such limitations is the existence of cooperative resistance from multiple parties in the finance system. in this study, relevant data from theworld bank inclusive finance database 2011-2017 and the cbrc website were selected to analyze the current development level of inclusive finance in china in order to perform longitudinal time and horizontal international comparisons. the article summarizes the chinese experience with inclusive finance and points out the dilemma of sustainable development. then, based on the new perspective of synergy, the article breaks down financial institutions by type and provides an analysis of the cooperative resistance among the three major parties considering their behavioral motivations. finally, we put forward the corresponding countermeasures to the dilemma of the sustainable development of inclusive finance in rural china by numerical simulations. © 2019 by the authors."
"this study has examined the impact of noise on individual job performance in the open-plan office. forty participants were randomly assigned to a controlled condition and exposed to low-intensity noise, ranging from 40 db to 70 db. the experimental noise comes from a single sound source of office conversations. the prominent feature of the neurobehavioral approach is its focus on the change of human behavior, which can reflect the effect of environment on human brain function. changes in nervous system function can be evaluated by measuring changes in a person's behavior. therefore, we arranged four neurobehavioral tests to record the changes in workers' job performance, including perception, learning andmemory, thinking, and execution tests. it was found that noise in open-plan office affected individual job performance differentially, which mainly depends on the category of job. from the point of view of noise impact on individual job performance, the open officemay bemore suitable for themilitary industry and some mechanically repetitive jobs. in the information technology, service, finance and government industry, it is desirable to take the semi-open form. it is only appropriate to use a private office for the academic industry, which requires a lot of thought. © 2019 institute of noise control engineering."
"a growing body of research and practical applications employ social media data as a proxy for the complex behavior of investors in financial markets. this paper provides an overview of academic research related to the link between social media and financial markets in order to give insight into future works and challenges on investor sentiment analysis. the theoretical rationale of this relationship is predominantly defined by behavioral finance. behavioral finance shows that emotions have a considerable impact on individual behavior. researchers of this discipline contradict the standard model of efficient markets and considers irrational factors like investors sentiment and public mood as influential for asset pricing and financial market volatility. in this context, social media is a novel tool enabling the collection of data about such behavioral factors. © 2019 ieee."
"information from microblogs is gaining increasing attention from researchers interested in analyzing fluctuations in stock markets. behavioral financial theory draws on social psychology to explain some of the irrational behaviors associated with financial decisions to help explain some of the fluctuations. in this study we argue that social media users who demonstrate an interest in finance can offer insights into ways in which irrational behaviors may affect a stock market. to test this, we analyzed all the data collected over a 3-month period in 2011 from tencent weibo (one of the largest microblogging websites in china). we designed a social influence (si)-based tencent finance-related moods model to simulate investors' irrational behaviors, and designed a tencent moods-based stock trend analysis (tm_sta) model to detect correlations between tencent moods and the hushen-300 index (one of the most important financial indexes in china). experimental results show that the proposed method can help explain the data fluctuation. the findings support the existing behavioral financial theory, and can help to understand short-term rises and falls in a stock market. we use behavioral financial theory to further explain our findings, and to propose a trading model to verify the proposed model. © 2019 asis&t"
"purpose: this paper aims to examine the applicability of real options methodology with respect to developing internal transfer pricing mechanisms. a pervasive theme in existing models is their inability to handle the dynamic and volatile nature of today’s business environment, as well as their lack of objective managerial flexibility. the authors address these and other issues and develop a transfer pricing mechanism based on black–scholes and the binomial options pricing methodology, which is better suited in today’s dynamic business environment. design/methodology/approach: the authors use a conceptual approach in developing theoretical justifications and show, practically, how a transfer price can be developed using two different real options pricing models. findings: the authors find that real options transfer price mechanism (real options framework [rof]) can effectively deal with many of the issues that permeate a modern organization with complex multi-dimensional operations. the authors argue that uncertainty and behavioral issues commonly associated with setting transfer prices are better handled using a transfer pricing mechanism that preserves flexibility at the business unit level, the managerial level and the firm level. the approach allows for different managerial styles in both centralized and decentralized sub-units within the same organization. the authors argue that an open multi-dimensional framework using real options is suitable under conditions of uncertainty and managerial opportunism. practical implications: rof-based transfer pricing may be significant in that firms can use it as a tool to manage an organization by setting the prices centrally and at the same time allowing managers to select the transfer price that best suits their specific situation and operating conditions. this may result in a more efficient and more profitable organization. originality/value: the contribution of the paper is the melding of the rof from the finance literature with the accounting problem of setting a transfer price for items lacking a competitive market price. the authors also contribute to existing research by explicitly developing a framework that values managerial flexibility, takes into account uncertainty and considers the behavioral aspects of the transfer pricing process. the authors establish the conditions under which a generic real options model is a feasible alternative in determining a transfer price. © 2019, emerald publishing limited."
"the ability to define accurate linear models to find patterns or relationships between variables is one of the most challenging fields in computer science. in particular, extrapolative applications are widely used to predict values in biological, behavioral and social sciences. analysts usually focus on reducing the approximation error in order to ensure fairly reliable predictions. using pattern detection models such as multilayer artificial neural networks can offer good results in predicting possible outcomes, however they might not be the optimal fit for predicting evolutionary trends due to their inherent overfitting characteristics. regression models, on the other hand are more often used to predict trending behaviors and therefore they can be more helpful when studying the evolution of a given instrument, symbol or series. however, a simple regression model can be very inaccurate with an unacceptable prediction error rate. this paper shows an automatic method to find trends in known instruments, by using a massive linear regression technique combined with a conventional machine learning proposal that works on optimizing the weights of the linear regressive structures. in this paper the authors show an application of the model in finance (stocks market instruments), however the proposal is designed to work for to any discipline that studies the trends of any evolutionary object. © 2019"

"behavioral finance is a powerful tool when used effectively by investors and financial advisers. although this usefulness is generally accepted in theory, the practical value of behavioral advice to investors has not been quantified to a large degree. the article provides a quantitative analysis of behavioral mistakes using a fictional case study of a private family that is making two key behavioral mistakes: loss aversion and mental accounting. first, these biases are explained, with examples. next, the case study illustrates and quantifies investment losses due to behavioral mistakes. the key conclusion of the case study is that making behavioral mistakes causes investors to forgo returns, and this loss of return can be significant. however, if advisers and investors can recognize and correct behavioral mistakes, recouping or avoiding these gains is possible; these losses are not necessary. in sum, the value of behavioral advice is significant. © 2019 portfolio management research. all rights reserved."
"behavioral finance has been widely applied in the financial realm from psychological perspectives focusing on herding and disposition effects. however, little research is devoted to the influences of personality traits on the stock investment intentions of individuals. this study extends the theory of planned behavior incorporating the big five personality taxonomies to investigate the effects of the personality traits of individual investors on stock investment intention. utilizing partial least squares based on structural equation modeling techniques with a sample of 385 subjects, empirical results indicate that the stock investment intentions of individuals are significantly affected by subjective norm, attitude, and perceived behavioral control, and subjective norm significantly affects attitude. individuals with open and agreeable personalities tend to have influences on subjective norm. neurotic individuals tend to have negative attitudes toward stock investment. the perceived behavioral control of individuals regarding stock investment is influenced by the personality traits of agreeableness, extroversion, conscientiousness, and openness. prior stock trading experiences significantly affect the relationships between attitude and stock investment intention, as well as on the linkages between extroversion and subjective norm, attitude, and perceived behavioral control. this study concludes with the discussion of the findings, with insights into theory and managerial implications. © 2019 by the author."

"at first glance, it may be easy to see many deficiencies in the efficient market theory, created in the 1970s by eugene fama. eugene fama never imagined that his efficient market would be 100% efficient all the time. of course, it's impossible for the market to attain full efficiency all the time, as it takes time for stock prices to respond to new information released into the investment community. the efficient hypothesis, however, does not give a strict definition of how much time prices need to revert to fair value. moreover, under an efficient market, random events are entirely acceptable but will always be ironed out as prices revert to the norm. it is important to ask, however, whether emh undermines itself in its allowance for random occurrences or environmental eventualities. there is no doubt that such eventualities must be considered under market efficiency but, by definition, true efficiency accounts for those factors immediately. in other words, prices should respond nearly instantaneously with the release of new information that can be expected to affect a stock's investment characteristics. so, if the emh allows for inefficiencies, it may have to admit that absolute market efficiency is impossible the study tries to elucidate the very factor that is “cognitive psychology: the study of how people (including investors) think, reason, and make decisions”. they may not be always rational. individuals do not always act shrewdly when it comes to making financial decisions and that there are various mental errors that influence them while making decisions. the sample size of the study is 60 employees of private equity companies. the sampling technique used is simple random sampling. primary data has been used in the study, which was collected through a structured questionnaire based on behavioral finance techniques and investment preference. various statistical tools were used to analyze the data like descriptive statistics, t-test statistical tool, correlation tool and percentage analysis. the study tried to explain the irrational decisions taken by the investors during the time of taking financial portfolio decisions. through the study, it is discerned that private equity employees are aware about the various possibilities in investments and it is found that there exist a relationship between behavioral finance and investment preference among employees of private equity companies. using the principles of behavioral finance and investment preference the study tried to delve the psychological concept of “individual attachment style”, especially with reference to employees of private equity companies and the wide range of investment avenues and their investment preference procedure. ©beiesp."
"traditional finance theory considers that the impact of noise traders' attention on asset prices is offset by attention from smart investors. this paper uses online search data to study the influence of noise traders and smart investors on stock returns and volatility. adopting an original approach, we construct a proxy for smart investor attention based on investors' online search behavior provided by wikipedia page traffic. we combine this new measure with a standard measure of noise traders' attention as proxied by google search volume index. we show for a sample of 87 french firms over the period 2008–2018 that only noise traders' attention influences stock returns. noise traders' attention increases volatility by creating an extra risk that is priced into the market. conversely, smart investors' attention decreases volatility because their presence stabilizes stock prices by reducing uncertainty. our empirical results support a behavioral explanation of stock prices. © 2019 elsevier b.v."
"we propose a simple model of how investors evaluate a trading rule, and show that the market timing of technical trading rules induces lottery-like trading profits. therefore, investors’ preference for positive skewness caters to the popularity of technical analysis. since prospect theory implies strong skewness preference, it can explain why investors trade extensively on chart patterns that are meaningless in light of the efficient market hypothesis. technicians often invoke behavioral finance as its theoretical foundation. contrary to this view, we show that ideas from behavioral finance explain why technical analysis is popular despite the lack of theoretical foundation and empirical success. © 2019 elsevier b.v."
"background: this study investigated the nonsuicidal self-injury (nssi) presentation and the features of coping methods among college students, in addition to analyzing the factors that influence self-injury behavior. methods: from april to november 2016, 2,520 undergraduate students who were studying in some colleges in anhui province in china were surveyed using the self-injury behavioral survey questionnaire and the coping styles questionnaire (csq). results: the detection rate of self-injury behavior among college students was 13.73%. frequent internet use and smoking were associated with self-injury behavior (p < 0.05). there were statistically significant differences between the self-injury group and the non-self-injury group in terms of the coping methods of problem-solving, self-reproach, help-seeking, and illusions (p < 0.01). according to the logistic regression analysis of the students, their place of origin, mother’s education, family finances, family type, family relationships, gender, frequent internet use, and smoking were associated with self-injury behavior (p< 0.01). self-reproach and withdrawal were risk factors for self-injury behavior while problem-solving and rationalization were protective factors for self-injury behavior. conclusion: students who frequently use the internet and smoke are more prone to self-injury. college stu-dents’ choices of problem-solving and rational coping styles in the face of pressure are conducive to preventing nonsuicidal self-injury. © 2019, iranian journal of public health. all rights reserved."
"purpose: people are increasingly responsible for making sound financial decisions to foster their financial satisfaction and well-being, which magnifies the importance of financial literacy, and this concept and measurement is still not yet crystallized in the literature, specifically capturing different behavior perceptions. moreover, there is not a distinction based on different classifications of behavior, such as over or underconfidence, to understand the relation between literacy and decision process. to fill this gap, this paper aims to investigate whether the financial literacy conceptual model proposed applies similarly to every group independently of their previous self-confidence perception. for this purpose and quality control, oecd (2016) data were used with a final sample of 1,487 brazilian citizens. quantitative analysis technique using partial least squares structural equations path modeling and differences between groups using multi-group analysis was applied. in line with general studies, when analyzing the financial literacy usual model for the group as a whole, financial knowledge construct positively influences self-confidence, and both together positively affect financial behavior. however, for individuals with low financial knowledge and low self-confidence, as well as for those with too much or too little confidence, the model did not hold. therefore, self-confidence perception influences the way financial knowledge is used for financial decisions and should be addressed in financial education and training to be more effective. design/methodology/approach: to operationalize the variables and test the paper’s hypotheses, the authors used the methodology developed in oecd (2016), based on the research instrument’s brazilian application adapted from the questionnaire developed in oecd (2015), with data initially used and made available by garber and koyama (2016). based on the recommendations of hair jr et al. (2017a, 2017b), the authors used partial least squares modeling pls-pm (smartpls 3.2.6) to estimate the structural models. findings: concerning structural relationships, the final model showed knowledge with a positive influence on self-confidence, self-confidence with a positive effect on behavior and knowledge with a positive influence on behavior, both directly and, through its relationship with self-confidence, indirectly. this underscores that, for the total sample, the greater people’s knowledge and self-confidence, the better their behavior. the unexpected absence of attitude in the final model, even allowing for potential measurement problems, brings up an important reflection on the mediating effect that the self-control variable may exert between attitude and behavior. a person may believe that saving for the future is important (attitude) but whether they actually save (behavior) may depend on self-control, which is needed to prevent immediate gains from being prioritized in practice. research limitations/implications: the findings reported so far concern the study’s total sample. however, as expected from the literature review that provides the basis for the sixth and the most important hypothesis, respondents were found to be heterogeneous in terms of knowledge and self-confidence levels. these differences were evaluated by means of multi-group analyses that indicated that the model does not apply to respondents with low knowledge and low self-confidence and to those who are over- and underconfident. this implies inferring that financial education programs may be of little use if they only address technical knowledge development and fail to consider behavioral aspects such as those related to self-confidence, as this paper points out, and others. this signals the importance of diagnosing people’s profiles to enable developing solutions capable of minimizing the presence of behavioral biases. this need to be studied further. practical implications: the results imply inferring that financial education programs may be of little use if they only address technical knowledge development and fail to consider behavioral aspects such as those related to self-confidence, as this paper points out, and others. models must be reviewed in light of natural diferences of cognition and lead to customized financial education. social implications: this signals the importance of diagnosing people’s profiles to enable developing solutions capable of minimizing the presence of behavioral biases. therefore, not only training topics in personal finance but also a deeper education program since the kindergarden must be considered. originality/value: its practical contribution is to suggest the development of financial education programs that also take account of the potential presence of behavioral biases, which may prevent the misallocation of (scarce) public- and private-sector funds stemming from a limited focus on developing the population’s actual financial knowledge. © 2018, thiago borges ramalho and denis forte."

"purpose: this paper aims to investigate a relatively new anomaly of investment growth and revisits well-known anomalies of size and value. it aims to answer two main research questions. first, can covariance risks (i.e. factor loadings) be excluded from being determining variables that drive return premiums and explain stock returns? second, from a behavioral finance standpoint, the authors examine whether using firm characteristics is a more practical and accessible approach and also meets the necessary and sufficient conditions to analyze stock returns. design/methodology/approach: the authors create the investment-growth-based factor (lmh) which is defined as the return difference between low and high investment growth portfolios. the authors then incorporate the lmh factor along with other characteristic-based factors and their loadings into characteristic-balanced portfolio and three-factor model tests. findings: the authors find that covariance risks on investment growth, size and value are not necessary as determining variables. instead, they find that behavioral-related firm characteristics of investment growth, size and value are necessary and sufficient as determinants of return premiums and stock returns. practical implications: the results have practical and useful implications for investors in their stock portfolio analysis and selection because firm characteristics are relatively more available than covariance risks that need estimation and typically contain measurement errors. originality/value: the paper has practical value to investors in their stock portfolio analysis and selection. methodologically, in contrast to prior studies that do not directly use the investment growth to control for portfolio characteristics, the use of the newly created lmh factor and its loadings allows us to directly and properly test if the investment growth anomaly is related to the investment growth characteristic that is hypothesized to drive return premiums and determine stock returns from behavioral finance perspectives. © 2019, emerald publishing limited."
"pension fund investments have a substantial influence on sustainability. we analyze preferences for sustainable investment among a representative cross-section of 2486 pension fund participants in the netherlands, through a questionnaire survey fielded in the liss panel. in contrast to standard investment theory, we find that sustainable investments are commonly favored, even if they harm financial interests. to explain variation among participants’ preferences for sustainable investments, we test socio-demographic factors suggested by dominant neoclassical investment and behavioral finance theories. moreover, we add to the existing literature by developing an alternative cultural-theoretical explanation that stresses the role of value orientations. we estimate linear and generalized ordered logit regression models, and find little support for neoclassical and behavioral finance theories, but substantial support for the importance of value orientations. given established patterns of value-change, this finding suggests that a further increase in the demand for sustainable investments across developed economies is a likely scenario. © 2019, © 2019 the author(s). published by informa uk limited, trading as taylor & francis group."
"purpose: behavioral finance research has almost exclusively investigated the decision making of lay individuals, mostly ignoring more sophisticated institutional investors. the purpose of this paper is to better understand the relatively unexplored field of investment decisions made by pension fund trustees, an important subset of institutional investors, and identify future avenues of further exploration. design/methodology/approach: this paper starts by setting out the landscape in which pension fund trustees operate and make their decisions, followed by a literature review of the extant behavioral finance research applicable to similar situations. findings: despite receiving training and accumulating experience in financial markets, these are limited and sparse; therefore, pension fund trustees are unlikely to be immune from behavioral biases. trustees make decisions in groups, are heavily reliant on advice and make decisions on behalf of others. research in those areas has uncovered many inefficiencies. it is still unknown how this specific context can affect the psychological effects on their decisions. research limitations/implications: given how much influence trustees’ decisions have on asset allocation and by extension in financial markets, this is a surprising state of affairs. research in behavioral finance has had a marked influence on policy in the past and so we anticipate that exploring the decisions made within pension funds may have wide ramifications for the industry. originality/value: as far as the authors are aware, no behavioral research has empirically tested pension fund trustees’ decisions to investigate how the combination of group decisions, advice and surrogacy influence their decisions and, ultimately, the sustainability of our pensions. © 2019, emerald publishing limited."

"purpose: this paper aims to investigate the relationship between investors’ demographic characteristics (age, gender, education level and experience) and their investment decisions through behavioral factors (sentiment, overconfidence, overreaction and underreaction and herd behavior) as mediator variables in the egyptian stock market. design/methodology/approach: this paper collects data from a structured questionnaire survey carried out among 384 local egyptian, foreign, institutional and individual investors. this paper used a partial multiple regression method to analyze the effect of investors’ demographic characteristics on investment decisions through behavioral factors as the mediator variable. findings: investor sentiment, overreaction and underreaction, overconfidence and herd behavior significantly affect investment decisions. also, age, gender and the level of education have significant positive effects on investment decisions by investors. experience does not play a significant role in investment decisions, but as investors gain experience, they tend to overlook the emotional factors. practical implications: the findings of this paper would help to understand common behavioral patterns of investors and indicate a path toward the growth of the egyptian stock market. originality/value: there is a lack of research in behavioral finance covering middle east and north african markets. this paper attempts to fulfill the gap by analyzing behavioral factors in the egyptian market. © 2018, emerald publishing limited."
"this study undertakes one of the first empirical attempts to investigate and contribute a set of innovative findings to investor herding behavior and herding spillover effects in globally listed shipping company stock returns. distinguishing between oecd and non-oecd markets, herding behavior is tested on a diversified set of shipping companies traded in international equity markets, over different business cycle phases, financial crises, and external shocks. a set of dynamic models, well established in the relevant behavioral finance literature, is implemented. empirical evidence indicates investor herding behavior in shipping stock returns and herding spillover effects between different shipping sectors, albeit not robust in all cases. these challenging findings can have a material impact on efficient investment and financing decisions of shipping market players. © 2019, © 2019 informa uk limited, trading as taylor & francis group."
"a summary of the literature in behavioral macro-finance is presented hereby. in the literature about behavioral finance, we encounter the distinction between behavioral macro-finance and behavioral micro-finance. behavioral macro-finance is defined as the field that ""detects and describes anomalies in the efficient market hypothesis that behavioral models may explain"" (pompian, 2006). behavioral micro-finance refers to the field that ""examines behaviors or biases of individual investors that distinguish them from the rational actors envisioned in classical economic theory"" (pompian, 2006). this chapter describes the rise of behavioral macro-finance and categorizes the literature into six subtopics: (1) bubbles, the ""irrational exuberance,""1 (2) the equity premium puzzle, (3) the volatility puzzle, (4) violation of the law of one price, limits to arbitrage, and (5) ""micro-efficient"" but ""macro-inefficient."" © 2019 by world scientific publishing co. pte. ltd. all rights reserved."
"traditional automated trading systems use rules and filters based on chartism to send orders to the market, aiming to beat the market and obtain positive returns in bullish or bearish contexts. however, these systems do not consider the investors’ mood that many studies have demonstrated its effects over the evolution of financial markets. the authors describe 2 ""big data"" algorithmic trading systems over ibex 35 future. these systems send orders to the market to open long or short positions, based on an artificial intelligence model that uses investors’ mood. to measure the investors' mood, the authors use semantic analysis algorithms that qualify as good, bad, or neutral any communication related to ibex 35 made on social media (twitter) or news media. after 1.5 years of research, conclusions are: first, the authors observe positive returns, demonstrating that investors’ mood has predictive capacity on the evolution of the ibex 35. second, these systems have beaten the ibex 35 index, showing the imperfect efficiency of the financial markets. third, big data algorithmic trading systems numbers are better in sharpe ratio, success rate, and profit factor than traditional trading systems on the ibex 35, listed in the trading motion platform. © 2018, © 2018 institute of behavioral finance."
"using market prices for an equity index, this research empirically estimates the complex interrelationship between the confidence of informed investors, aggregate market sentiment, and many other variables. the empirical results uncover new insights on investment behavior, including novel evidence on the root causes of various financial phenomena like the momentum and calendar month effects, which themselves appear to be caused by the incentive systems existing among institutional investors. investor confidence is found to fall (rise) with moderate (large) deviations between market prices and intrinsic values, but only true knowledge of that variable is discovered to enhance investment returns. © 2018, © 2018 institute of behavioral finance."
"existing research shows that people can improve their decision skills by learning what experts paid attention to when faced with the same problem. however, in domains like financial education, effective instruction requires frequent, personalized feedback given at the point of decision, which makes it time-consuming for experts to provide and thus, prohibitively costly. we address this by demonstrating an automated feedback mechanism that allows amateur decision-makers to learn what information to attend to from one another, rather than from an expert. in the first experiment, eye movements of n = 100 subjects were recorded while they repeatedly performed a standard behavioral finance investment task. consistent with previous studies, we found that a significant proportion of subjects were affected by decision bias. in the second experiment, a different group of n = 100 subjects faced the same task but, after each choice, they received individual, machine learning-generated feedback on whether their pre-decision eye movements resembled those made by experiment 1 subjects prior to good decisions. as a result, experiment 2 subjects learned to analyze information similarly to their successful peers, which in turn reduced their decision bias. furthermore, subjects with low cognitive reflection test scores gained more from the proposed form of process feedback than from standard behavioral feedback based on decision outcomes. © 2019 cognitive science society, inc."
"present bias is an important term in the theory of self-control in behavioral finance. empirical research finds that present bias is associated with undesirable spending, borrowing, and saving behaviors. unlike previous research that focuses on one domain of financial behavior, the purpose of this study is to examine associations between present bias and a set of financial behaviors in various domains: spending, borrowing, saving, and money management. with data from a national urban sample in china, results show that some behavioral patterns are consistent with theoretical predictions that present biased consumers are more likely to spend in the present and less likely to save for the future. the findings have implications for further research on present bias and help researchers better understand this important concept. the results are also informative for financial planners to better serve their clients. © 2019 certified financial planner board of standards inc."
"globally, the overexploitation of wildlife presents one of the greatest challenges for biodiversity conservation and sustainable rural livelihoods. research on the human dimensions of hunting is critical for identifying potential levers for behavioral change interventions. this is especially true in china where hunting threatens to extirpate avian species such as the green peafowl (pavo muticus) and great hornbill (buceros bicornis). nevertheless, regulations restricting gun ownership and hunting have made interviews on this topic highly sensitive. direct questions about conservation non-compliance are often affected by response bias such as refusals to answer or self-protective denials. we used the randomized response technique (rrt) to estimate the prevalence and drivers of illegal hunting targeting four focal bird taxa (barbets, bulbuls, partridges, and pheasants). furthermore, we used statistical models that have recently been introduced to the conservation science literature to perform multivariate analyses for rrt data. we measured economic, demographic, and attitudinal covariates that could be associated with hunting. we found high awareness of laws banning hunting in southwest china, but we also observed that 29.2% of the adult male population may have hunted birds in the past year. contrary to previous findings highlighting subsistence and finance as major factors driving hunting, the most important predictors of hunting activity in this landscape were related to attitudes regarding the enjoyment of hunting. extra-economic motivations, such as the entertainment value of hunting, may be underappreciated drivers of hunting behavior. behavioral change interventions such as pride campaigns may be a promising approach to regulate bird hunting in xishuangbanna in collaboration with local communities. © 2019 elsevier ltd"
"the area of behavioral finance, though relatively young, has matured and spread beyond its initial objectives: to demonstrate the fallibility of the efficient market hypothesis, to shake the belief in the ubiquity of rational decision making, and to convince the finance world of the importance of psychological biases in decision making. the success of the field in meeting its goals, however, has called into question its continued relevance. behavioral finance is thus currently at a crossroads, and researchers need to decide which way they should turn for the area to continue to thrive and to meaningfully contribute to financial knowledge. this collection of papers deals with rarely-explored topics to point at new directions that behavioral finance should explore to maintain its viability, along with contributions to traditional topics. some of these topics include innovations, the psychology of policy-makers, biases of peer-to-peer market participants, the behavior and motivation behind corporate social responsibility, and the design of exchanges. additionally, well-known topics such as the disposition effect, slow and fast decisions and the availability heuristic are revisited, and surprising new findings are presented. by opening the field to novel avenues of discussion, this book addresses the future of behavioral finance and its transition into a new era. © 2019 by world scientific publishing co. pte. ltd. all rights reserved."
"this book discusses capital markets and investment decision-making, focusing on the globalisation of the world economy. it presents empirically tested results from indian and southwest asian stock markets and offers valuable insights into the working of indian capital markets. the book is divided into four parts: the first part examines capital-market operations, particularly clearance and settlement processes, and stock market operations. the second part then addresses the functioning of global markets and investment decisions; more specifically it explores calendar anomalies, dependencies, overreaction effect, causality effect and stock returns volatility in south asia, u.s. and global stock markets as a whole. part three covers issues relating to capital structure, values of firm and investment strategies. lastly, part four discusses emerging issues in finance like behavioral finance, islamic finance, and international financial reporting standards. the book fills the gap in the existing finance literature and helps fund managers and individual investors make more accurate investment decisions. © springer nature india private limited 2019. all rights reserved."
"a large literature in empirical public finance relies on “bunching” to identify a behavioral response to non-linear incentives and to translate this response into an economic object to be used counterfactually. we conduct this type of analysis in the context of prescription drug insurance for the elderly in medicare part d, where a kink in the individual's budget set generates substantial bunching in annual drug expenditure around the famous “donut hole.” we show that different alternative economic models can match the basic bunching pattern, but have very different quantitative implications for the counterfactual spending response to alternative insurance contracts. these findings illustrate the importance of modeling choices in mapping a compelling reduced form pattern into an economic object of interest. © 2019"
"purpose: the purpose of this paper is to study the disposition effect that is exhibited by the investors through the review of research articles in the area of behavioral finance. when the investors are hesitant to realize the losses and quick to realize the gains, this phenomenon is known as the disposition effect. this paper explains various theories, which have been evolved over the years that has explained the phenomenon of disposition effect. it includes the behavior of individual investors, institutional investors and mutual fund managers. design/methodology/approach: the authors have used the existing literatures from the various authors, who have studied the disposition effect in either real market or the experimental market. this paper includes literature over a period of 40 years, that is, dyl, 1977, in the form of tax loss selling, to the most recent paper, surya et al. (2017). some authors have used the pgr-plr ratio for calculating the disposition effect in their study. however, some authors have used t-test, annova, correlation coefficient, standard deviation, regression, etc., as a tool to find the presence of disposition effect. findings: the effect of disposition can be changed for different types of individual investors, institutional investors and mutual funds. the individual investors are largely prone to the disposition effect and the demographic variables like age, gender, experience, investor sophistication also impact the occurrence of the disposition effect. on the other side, the institutional investors and mutual funds managers may or may not be affected by the disposition effect. practical implications: the skilled understanding of the disposition effect will help the investors, financial institutions and policy-makers to reduce the adverse effect of this bias in the stock market. this paper contributes a detailed explanation of disposition effect and its impacts on the investors. the study of disposition effect has been found to be insufficient in the context of indian capital market. social implications: the investors and society at large can gains insights about causes and influences of disposition effect which will be helpful to create sound investment decisions. originality/value: this paper has complied the 11 causes for the occurrence of disposition effect that are found by the different authors. the paper also highlights the impact of the disposition effect in the decision-making of various investors. © 2019, emerald publishing limited."
"the growing literature on crowdfunding has mostly focused on the determinants of campaigns success, as well as on the legal and macroeconomic drivers of the crowdfunding diffusion as a mean to finance innovative projects. still there are scant evidences on whether the returns for crowdfunders are consistent with the risk profile of crowdfunded projects. by studying 365 european clean-tech projects which raised capital via crowdfunding, we show that once the country risk has been accounted for, the returns are not consistent with the risks related to the technology adopted by the projects. behavioral factors like bounded rationality or the cultural dimension of investors may explain this apparent mispricing of risks. while projects’ returns are, on average, negatively related to risks, we find that projects offering better risk-adjusted returns attract relatively larger average contributions. our results have important implications for understanding the drivers of crowdfunding returns and its sustainability, and particularly for its diffusion as an instrument to foster the transition to a low-carbon economy. © 2018 elsevier inc."
"crowdfunding platforms have become a valid alternative for raising funds for both entrepreneurial and humanitarian projects. the aim of our study is to investigate the factors influencing the likelihood of funding success across these two project types. building on the charitable giving and entrepreneurial finance literature streams, we employ the lenses of signaling theory and behavioral decision making to hypothesize how the impact of certain factors varies contingent on the nature of the project, from a humanitarian plea to an entrepreneurial venture. we conduct our investigation on kiva and find that gender bias and risk signals exhibit a stronger impact on the likelihood of funding success for entrepreneurial projects, whereas humanitarian projects are more affected by home bias. by reconciling prior inconsistencies in crowdfunding research and bringing forward new ideas, we aim to support the vigorous growth of an emergent phenomenon that is of growing social and economic importance. © the author(s) 2018."
"decisions are often delegated to experts chosen based on their past performance record which may be subject to noise. for instance, a person with little skill could still make a lucky decision that proves correct ex-post, while a skilled expert could make the best possible use of available information to reach a decision that, with hindsight, turns out incorrect. we aimed to show that one could assess decision skills more accurately when analyzing not only the observed decisions, but also the decision-making process. incorporating eye-tracking into an established behavioral finance experimental framework, we found that making an eye transition between pieces of information that previous research associated with bias makes one less likely to make good financial decisions in future trials. thus, even the simplest, easy to obtain eye metrics could allow us to more accurately judge if a person’s performance is a reflection of skill, or down to luck and unlikely to be reproduced in the future. © 2019. the authors license this article under the terms of the creative commons attribution 3.0 license."
"personal financial planning has conventionally been done by the human experts following modern portfolio theory and its variants. recent studies have tested fuzzy systems to mimic this complex and ambiguous process, using the investor's demographic and financial information as inputs. in parallel, there has been behavioral finance studies to assess risk tolerance of individuals based on similar inputs. however, there have been limited attempts to synergize these paradigms. this study focused on combining the two approaches to improve investment allocation performance over modern portfolio theory-based benchmarks. specifically, utility theory of money was applied to create risk tolerance profiles using risk scores. two fuzzy systems using two approaches of risk scoring were developed for investment allocation across four asset classes. expert recommended allocations, collected through a survey, formed the gold standard for system performance validation. both systems outperformed the benchmark. the hybrid system with a regression-based convergence module and 4 fuzzy subsystems performed the best. it had a mean absolute deviation of 7.7% and an average rank correlation of 0.52 with expert recommendations. however, the system was more conservative than human experts in most cases. future studies should test the effect of optimized ruleset selection in addressing this issue. © 2019 ieee."
"purpose: the purpose of this paper is to explore potential benefits of gamification (application of game-playing elements) for financial well-being and motivation to save. design/methodology/approach: a preliminary survey of college students explored how gamification principles incorporated into money-savings/personal finance smartphone apps could improve financial well-being. the main study utilized mechanical turk participants, exposing them to financial game app descriptions that emphasized social features (e.g. leaderboards and ability to share achievements) or economic features (e.g. ability to earn real money or a higher interest rate). objective and subjective financial measures including expertise with financial apps, perceived benefits of financial apps and behavioral intentions were examined. findings: financial worry, financial literacy, subjective knowledge and expertise with money-savings/financial applications predicted financial well-being. additionally, consumers varied in their preferences for certain financial game app features based on past financial app experience. those who already used a financial app tend to exhibit higher subjective (though not objective) knowledge, and want both “social” and “economic” features of financial applications, whereas those with no experience are more motivated by economic features. practical implications: these results could be used to guide game designers regarding which features may be more attractive to consumers depending on their prior expertise with financial smartphone applications. financial services marketing would benefit from further research into whether smartphone financial applications that emphasize social features have benefits for consumers’ motivation and financial well-being. originality/value: examining college students about to enter the real world and the general population, this project contributes to research to improve understanding of financial well-being by examining how already having a financial gamification application impacts perceptions of knowledge and expertise, as well as intentions to save given a more socially focused vs economically focused savings app. additional research needs to further explore gamification as an experimental intervention to ultimately improve both subjective financial well-being and objective financial behaviors, especially for consumers with lower expertise and high risk of financial vulnerability. © 2019, emerald publishing limited."
"purpose: the purpose of this paper is to propose a better understanding of how entrepreneurial narrative influences resource acquisition in the fundraising context. design/methodology/approach: the paper combines the literature on emotion as information theory from psychology with behavioral finance findings to develop a conceptual framework with research proposals highlighting the use of narratives in the crowdfunding process. findings: the proposition of the paper advocates that entrepreneurial narrative may influence crowdfunders’ attitude and decision to fund a project. it theorizes how emotions in narratives shape the funders’ attitude toward a project and, in turn, their decision to support it. this potential influence is qualified by taking into account the funders’ primary motivations. these motivations affect the degree to which funders rely on affect or cognition to form their attitude and to which they are influenced by more emotional or cognitive narratives. originality/value: this framework is the result of an effort to achieve the recognition of emotions in entrepreneurial funding. the paper creates a bridge between the narrative emotional content and the often neglected emotional arousal of funders (considered as traditional investors) to provide a framework for explaining crowdfunders’ decision making. the paper also offers nuances by taking into account the different audiences’ motivations to fund a project. © 2018, emerald publishing limited."
"executives act based on their experiences, values, personality and personal interpretation of the situations which they face in their companies. investigations in the field of behavioral corporate finance have determined that there are some relations between ceos’ personal traits and financial decisions of large companies, but these results are based on indirect personal trait measurements and on public companies. to see whether such relations also exist between ceos’ personal traits and the financial structure of large private companies, we used psychometric tests to measure their level of optimism, risk attitude and affect heuristic, collected financial data for a period of fourteen years, and considered the economic situation of the country as a key factor in these relations. this paper reports the relationship of executives’ personal traits with the financial structure of large spanish companies for the period 2001–2014. we observed that executives’ high optimism (and risk aversion attitude) is positively (negatively) related to long-term debt, whilst positive affect is directly associated to the financial leverage and short-term debt. this paper also reports a change of relations when taking into account the country’s economic situation. in effect, by considering this new variable, executives’ risk aversion is seen to be associated to financial leverage and short-term debt, whilst ceos’ positive affect is linked to long-term debt. these relations are strongly moderated and they become statistically significant in a contracting economic period. in conclusion, the links between ceos’ personal traits and financial structure of large private spanish companies make sense when the effect of the economic situation is taken into account. furthermore, the awareness of these links helps to understand the financial decisions taken within large spanish companies. © 2019 hernández-pérez et al. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited."
"this paper studies a supply chain network (scn) equilibrium model considering decision makers’ multi-attribute behaviors from the perspective of behavioral finance. in this paper, an equilibrium model of an uncertain snc is constructed, in which retailers choose their decisions according to their risk-averse behavior, loss-averse behavior, and regret-averse behavior. by using different weights to represent retailers’ attitudes to these three behaviors, the retailers’ multi-attribute utility functions are developed. the equilibrium conditions of the manufacturers, the retailers, together with the network are established by the finite-dimensional variational inequality formulation. three numerical examples are solved. in the first numerical example, we illustrate the effect of each of these three behaviors on the equilibrium decisions, the profits, and the utilities of the decision makers. in the other two numerical examples, we explore the effects of changes in attitudes to these three behaviors on the equilibrium decisions, profits, and utilities of the decision makers. the numerical results show that the equilibrium decisions are affected by each of these three behaviors very much. moreover, they are sensitive to the changes in attitudes to these behaviors. © 2018 elsevier b.v."
"behavioural finance has gained research interest among researchers because of investor behavior and market anomalies. investor behaviour varies with demographics and geographic characteristics. further, investor behavior towards a gold exchange trade fund is gaining research interest due to various factors. not much research has been carried out in this direction, with the exception of some comparisons. therefore, the performance of a gold exchange traded fund needs to be assessed from the investor behavior perspective. additionally, the investors behavior contains uncertainties. thus, there is a need for intelligent techniques for identifying the investors behavior despite the presence of uncertain behavioral characteristics. therefore, to study uncertain behavior characteristic in gold exchange traded fund, in this article the authors employ a fuzzy rough set. they employ fuzzy rough quick reduct algorithm to find the superfluous attributes. further decision rules are generated to identify the chief feature of investors’ behavior towards gold exchange traded fund. copyright © 2019, igi global."
"recent literature suggests that the persistent gender wage gap, joined with a larger proportion of student loan debt, reduces the financial benefits of a college degree for women. grounded in the theory of human capital and behavioral finance, this study investigates gender differences in student loan decisions using an experimental survey design with the online data collection. participants (n = 1926) were randomly assigned to a treatment scenario about whether to enter college or the workforce that was manipulated by attribute frames of a gain, loss, or aspiration and varied by the gender of the character in a hypothetical scenario. the attribute frames did not influence the evaluation of student loan decisions. no significant gender differences were found in the evaluation of student loan borrowing or the experimental treatment scenarios, suggesting societal movement towards more gender-neutral attitudes regarding student loan borrowing and degree-seeking motivations. © 2019, springer science+business media, llc, part of springer nature."
"the traditional financial paradigm seeks to understand financial markets by using models in which markets are perfect, which includes agents who are “rational” and update their beliefs correctly based on new information. by comparison, the new institutional economics approach attempts to provide a more realistic picture of economic processes, even in financial markets, by postulating several market imperfections, including the agents’ limited rationality. in contrast, behavioral finance completely challenges the rationality assumption and aims to improve the understanding of financial markets by assuming that, due to psychological factors, investors’ decisions will contradict the expected utility theory. however, the traditional, new institutional and the behavioral finance models all share one important feature: they are all based on the notion of a representative agent even though this mythological figure is dressed differently. evolutionary finance suggests a model of portfolio selection and asset price dynamics that is explicitly based on the ideas of investors’ heterogeneity, dynamics and changes, learning and a natural selection of strategies. the paper suggests a systematization of this new approach, which is subsequently used to conduct a state-of-the-art literature survey and an evaluation of evolutionary finance research. © 2018, springer nature switzerland ag."
"objective: to explore the eating experience and eating-related quality of life (erqol) of community-dwelling older adults with tooth loss. method: nineteen older adults from the clinics of a northeast us dental school who met inclusion criteria (>65 y old, <20 teeth, and no dentures) composed the sample. for this mixed methods study, demographic characteristics, number and location of teeth, mini nutritional assessment–short form score, and anthropometrics data were collected; semistructured interviews were conducted to collect in-depth information about the eating experience and erqol. thematic analysis was completed with nvivo 12 software (qsr international). results: participants’ mean age was 71.3 y (sd = 5.2); 52.6% (n = 10) were women; 63.2% (n = 12) were black or african american. the mean mini nutritional assessment–short form score of 12.1 was reflective of normal nutrition status; 31.6% (n = 6) of patients were at risk for malnutrition or were malnourished. fifteen percent (n = 3) were fully edentulous; 84.2% (n = 16) had 1 to 19 teeth (mean = 10.8, sd = 6.5). the 2 overarching themes identified were adaptive and maladaptive behavioral responses to tooth loss. adaptive strategies included modification in food preparation and cooking methods, food texture selection, meal timing, and approaches to chewing. maladaptive behaviors included food avoidance and limiting eating and smiling in front of others. psychosocial factors, including finances, limited food choices and erqol, whereas the support of family and friends enhanced erqol according to participants. conclusion: older adults with tooth loss exhibit both adaptive and maladaptive behaviors that affect their eating experience, dietary intake, and erqol. while many expressed positive adaptive coping strategies, they also described maladaptive behaviors, including avoidance of healthy foods and limiting eating during social interactions, which may affect their nutritional status and overall health and well-being. further research is needed to explore how duration and severity of tooth loss influence these behaviors and risk of malnutrition. interprofessional approaches are needed to support positive adaptation and coping with tooth loss. knowledge transfer statement: the results of this study can be used by health professionals treating patients with tooth loss in an effort to improve their eating experience and eating-related quality of life. the findings provide data to support further studies and the need for evidence-based guidelines and educational materials to meet the unique needs of older adults with tooth loss. © international & american associations for dental research 2019."
"this study combines the concepts of information asymmetry from classical finance theory and herding behavior from modern behavioral finance theory to investigate whether herding behavior exists in the taiwan stock market. scores from the information disclosure and transparency ranking system (idtrs) are incorporated into the nonlinear model proposed by chang, cheng, and khorana (2000). the empirical results reveal that herding behavior is prevalent in the taiwan stock market and the implementation of the idtrs has effectively discouraged such behavior. in addition, the empirical results of this study reveal that the lower level of transparency, the more prevalent of herding behavior in the taiwan stock market. the empirical results confirm the government’s efforts to increase the transparency of listed firms in order to reduce information asymmetry and prevent investors from engaging in herding behaviors. ©, copyright © taylor & francis group, llc."
"purpose: the purpose of this paper is to examine how financial literacy and demographic variables (gender, age, income level, education, occupation, marital status and investment experience) related to behavioral biases. design/methodology/approach: the study uses one-way analysis of variance (anova), factor analysis and multiple regression analysis to examine survey data from more than 500 individual investors in india. findings: the results reveal the presence of different behavioral biases including overconfidence and self-attribution, the disposition effect, anchoring bias, representativeness, mental accounting, emotional biases and herding among indian investors. hence, the findings support the view that individual investors do not always act rationally. the results also show that financial literacy has a negative association with the disposition effect and herding bias, a positive relation with mental accounting bias, but no significant relation with overconfidence and emotional biases. age, occupation and investment experience are the most important demographic variables that relate to the behavioral biases of individual investors in the sample. regarding gender, males are more overconfident than are females about their knowledge of the stock market. research limitations/implications: the study does not test for causality, only association between the variables. thus, the findings in this study should not be interpreted as suggesting causality. the study may have implications for financial educators in promoting the financial awareness programs for individuals. financial advisors can potentially become more effective by understanding their clients’ decision-making processes. originality/value: despite an extensive literature on behavioral finance, limited academic research attempts to unravel the relation of how financial literacy and demographic variates relate to behavioral biases. this study contributes to this literature by trying to fill this gap. © 2018, emerald publishing limited."

"the propensity of the forecasts of sell-side financial analysts to converge (or diverge) is a function of their exogenous and endogenous selective attention and overconfidence. when returns are negative, the endogenous form of selective attention—a static measure of analysts’ goal-driven attention at a particular point in time—has a positive association with convergence. the exogenous form of selective attention—a relatively involuntary dynamic process of exogenous attentional shift driven by external changes in the market over time—is associated with a tendency for forecasts to diverge. © 2018, © 2018 the institute of behavioral finance."
"purpose: the determinants of investor sentiment based on stock market proxies are found in numbers in empirical studies. however, investor sentiment antecedents developed from primary survey measures by constructing an investor sentiment index (isi) are not done till date. the purpose of this paper is to fill this research gap by first developing an isi for the indian retail investors and then examining the investor-specific, stock market-specific, macroeconomic and policy-specific factors’ individual impact on the investor sentiment. design/methodology/approach: first, the authors develop the isi by using the mean scores of six statements as formulated based on popular direct investor sentiment surveys undertaken throughout the world. then, the authors employ the structural equation modeling approach on the responses of 576 respondents on 40 statements (representing the index and four study hypotheses) collected in 2016 across the country. findings: the results show that investor- and stock market-specific factors are the major antecedents of investor sentiment for these investors. however, interestingly macroeconomic fundamentals and policy-specific factors have no role to play in driving their sentiment to invest in the stock market. practical implications: the major implication of the results is that the indian retail investors are showing a mixed approach of bayesian and behavioral finance decision making. so, these implications can guide the investment consultants, regulators, other stakeholders in markets and overwhelmingly the retail investors to introspect their investment decision making across time horizons. originality/value: the formulation of isi in an emerging market context and thereafter examining possible antecedents to influence retail investors in their investment decision making are not done till date. so, the study is unique in its research issue and findings and will have significant implication for the retail investors at least in emerging market contexts. © 2018, emerald publishing limited."
"the first generation of behavioral finance, starting in the early 1980s, largely accepted standard finance's notion of people's wants as ""rational"" wants-mainly high expected returns and low risk. that first generation commonly described people as ""irrational"" - misled by cognitive and emotional errors on their way to their rational wants. the second generation of behavioral finance describes people as ""normal,"" neither ""rational"" nor ""irrational."" normal people are people like you and me. each of us has wants, although our wants vary - hope for riches, freedom from poverty, nurturing children and families, being true to values, gaining high social status, playing games and winning, and more. we apply knowledge and cognitive and emotional shortcuts as we pursue our wants. sometimes, however, we are diverted from our wants by ignorance and cognitive and emotional errors. our wants, even more than our knowledge, ignorance, and cognitive and emotional shortcuts and errors, underlie answers to important questions of finance, including portfolio construction, saving and spending, asset pricing, and market efficiency (statman, 2017). © 2019 by world scientific publishing co. pte. ltd. all rights reserved."
"procrastination is an almost universal affliction, which occurs across culture and brings serious consequences across multiple fields, such as finance, health and education. previous research has showed procrastination can be influenced by future time perspective (ftp). however, little is known about the neural basis underlying the impact of ftp on procrastination. to address this question, we used voxel-based morphometry (vbm) based on brain structure. in line with previous findings, the behavioral result indicated that ftp inventory scores were significantly negatively correlated with procrastination inventory scores (r = −0.63, n = 160). the whole-brain vbm results showed that ftp scores were significantly negatively correlated with the grey matter (gm) volumes of the parahippocampal gyrus (paraphc) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmpfc) after the multiple comparisons correction. furthermore, mediation analyses revealed that the effect of gm volumes of the paraphc and vmpfc on procrastination was mediated by ftp. these results suggested that paraphc and vmpfc, the critical brain regions about episodic future thinking, could be the neural basis responsible for the impact of ftp on procrastination. the present study extends our knowledge on procrastination, and provides a novel perspective to understand the relationship between ftp and procrastination. © 2018, springer science+business media, llc, part of springer nature."

"an increasing number of the renowned company's investors are turning attention to stock prediction in the search for new efficient ways of hypothesizing about markets through the application of behavioral finance. accordingly, research on stock prediction is becoming a popular direction in academia and industry. in this study, the goal is to establish a model for predicting stock price movement through knowledge graph from the financial news of the renowned companies. in contrast to traditional methods of stock prediction, our approach considers the effects of event tuple characteristics on stocks on the basis of knowledge graph and deep learning. the proposed model and other feature selection models were used to perform feature extraction on the websites of thomson reuters and cable news network. numerous experiments were conducted to derive evidence of the effectiveness of knowledge graph embedding for classification tasks in stock prediction. a comparison of the average accuracy with which the same feature combinations were extracted over six stocks indicated that the proposed method achieves better performance than that exhibited by an approach that uses only stock data, a bag-of-words method, and convolutional neural network. our work highlights the usefulness of knowledge graph in implementing business activities and helping practitioners and managers make business decisions. © 2019 yang liu et al."

"the objective of this paper is to carry out a critical analysis of dividends and their role for investors. it describes theories on which the traditional economic approach relies, as well as theories considered to be a part of behavioral finance. the paper further focuses on stock indexes, such as msci world high dividend yield index, sg global quality income index and stoxx global 100 select dividend index. all the stock index returns are quarterly net returns converted into euro. the paper follows developments in said indexes from 1q 2002 till 4q 2018. statistical data compiled shows that all stock indexes are asymmetrical, with a high value, which fact has a significant impact on risk quantification, i.e., the way in which it is measured. stoxx global 100 selected dividend displayed the lowest value. further, differences were detected between the median and average values, for all the indexes examined. once again, stoxx global 100 selected dividend displayed the biggest difference: median values were founds to be nearly twice the average values. this also has an impact on the quantification of returns. to establish the dependency between the individual indexes, a spearman rank correlation was employed, and showed a significant dependency between the individual indexes. these findings and relatively short time series made us use a computationally-intensive method (bootstrap) and robust statistics to quantify the return and risk of stock indexes. a long-term investment into dividend shares can be said to bring investors a higher appreciation, at a lower risk, than investing into shares covering the entire market. however, it should be noted that the survey period lasted for more than 15 years and therefore, in shorter cycles or shorter periods, dividend equities may fall back in return. © 2019 international business information management association (ibima)."

"the roots of corporate social responsibility (csr) lie in the sensitivity to environmental and social sustainability. this sensitivity obviously includes corporate managers and must be developed throughout their education. this paper focuses on how to develop the sensitivity of business students to sustainability through an analysis of literary fiction. literature is an excellent source for being confronted with human feelings and attitudes. the central goal is to associate human situations with the outcomes of cool calculations, and, furthermore, to relate them to behavioral finance. with this aim, this paper analyses two plays: shakespeare’s the merchant of venice and ibsen’s the wild duck. the merchant of venice presents an interesting interweaving of financial and social sustainability. we find in it an unregulated financial system in which lenders can freely decide the clauses of the contracts. turning to the social side, the play shows a society dominated by the male of a dominant social class, against whom the racial and religious outcast shylock, a jew, plans revenge; while, in different ways, women try to overcome their secondary social role. after class discussions, students should be able to answer questions like: which social consequences do the lack of a fair financial regulation foster? how do pride, hate, and revenge create a barrier to social progress? the wild duck, in turn, can be taken as a metaphor of how humans cannot live confronted with nature. the environmental outrage (in reaction to the cutting down of the forest) that pervades the play and the tragedy that it creates are analyzed as the result of egotist management that puts aside environment and society. the old ekland’s last sentence, the forest has taken its revenge, summarizes the failure of men going against nature. © 2019, the author(s)."
"behavioral spillovers refer to the influence that a given intervention targeting behavior 1 exerts on a subsequent, non-targeted, behavior 2, which may or may not be in the same domain (health, finance, etc.) as one another. so, a nudge to exercise more, for example, could lead people to eat more or less, or possibly even to give more or less to charity depending on the nature of the spillover. but what if spillovers also operate backward; that is, if the expectation of behavior 1 influences behavior 0 that precedes it? for example, a person may form an intention to exercise prompted by a policy intervention but overeat at present as a result. we define such a possibility as a ""spillunder."" in the proposed article, we critically review the few papers that we have identified through a narrative literature review which have demonstrated spillunder effects to date, and we propose a conceptual framework. based on evidence about the human mind and behavior from psychology and economics, we argue that spillunder effects may be more common than the limited empirical findings suggest. we propose six representative mechanisms through which the prospect of behavior 1 may impact behavior 0: executive functions, moral licensing and moral cleansing, emotion regulation, energization, construal level, and savoring and dread. we further discuss the policy and practical implications of spillunder effects and examine methodological issues that need to be considered when empirically testing these effects. as with our earlier paper on spillovers, we aim to motivate other behavioral scientists to research behavioral spillunders more systematically and extensively, and to prompt decision makers to consider these effects when designing behavioral interventions. © 2019 krpan, galizzi and dolan."
"this research article examines the profitability on the momentum portfolios in the case of the emerging stock market of india, i.e. bombay stock exchange (bse). sustainable investing integrates environmental, social and governance (esg) characteristics into investment decisions. risk management is one of the most significant ranking factors determining the adoption of corporate strategies based on sustainable investing. a sustainable stock market provides a transparent and effective solution to inherent challenges related to environmental, social, economic and corporate governance issues. the theoretical and empirical analysis conducted in this research article reveals the status of bse of india in this regard. a company's sustainable market orientation is very important for future developments. the practical significance of this research paper is to investigate the profitability of momentum strategies in bombay stock exchange of india, which is an emergent market. moreover, the presence of short term momentum effect on indian stock market is basically an anomaly caused by behavioral and risk-based portfolio construction factors. on the other hand, momentum strategies is a reliable alternative with strong empirical evidence to both fundamental approaches of classical finance, namely efficient market hypothesis (emh) and behavioral finance paradigm. © 2019, alexandru ioan cuza university of iasi."
"stock market prediction has attracted much attention from both academia and business. both traditional finance and behavioral finance believe that market information affects stock movements. typically, market information consists of fundamentals and news information. to study how information shapes stock markets, common strategies are to concatenate various information into one compound vector. however, such concatenating ignores the interlinks between fundamentals and news information. in addition, the fundamental data are continuous values sampled at fixed time intervals, while news information occurred randomly. such heterogeneity leads to miss valuable information partially or twist the feature spaces. in this article, we propose a tensor-based event-lstm (elstm) to solve these two challenges. in particular, we model the market information with tensors instead of concatenated vectors and balance the heterogeneity of different data types with event-driven mechanism in lstm. experiments performed on an entire year data of china securities markets demonstrate the supreme of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art algorithms including azfintext, emaqt, and tesia. © 2019 ieee computer society. all rights reserved."

"the phenomenon of urbanization has placed bangkokians in situations with relatively limited living spaces. middle-income nuclear families generally choose to live individually in either small condominium units in the city center or small semi-detached houses in suburban areas, with relatively little concern or care for their neighbours. lower middle-income families, on the other hand, tend to live in bangkok’s periphery, with their relatives where possible, sharing limited resources for basic living such as food, housing, and finances. the current study examines row house design in suburban bangkok that typically houses lower middle-income families, with the aims of investigating how these families modify living spaces in order to support their lifestyles. data collected via interviews, observations, and physical as well as behavioral mappings led to two key findings with respect to how lower middle-income families optimize uses of their row houses. first, they maximize the uses of both interior and exterior spaces in order to house extended family members in a way that encourages successive generations to take good and close care of each other. this suggests a return to traditional thai reciprocal living culture where the older generations help raise grandchildren while those of working ages create income and take care of the older generations in return. second, income-generating activities can be held at home, with minimal labor costs, allowing each family member to contribute in some ways to the overall household income. regarding the minimal building costs that arise through small land plots and limited habitable spaces, we conclude by recommending an alternative row house design to better serve the varying and incremental needs of multi-generational lower middle-income families in thai social context. © common ground research networks, boonanan natakun, nichaporn suchai,"
"within the framework of behavioral finance, this research shows that financial behavior can be assessed as a cognitive construct. using certain variables, a multidimensional “cognitive finance” construct can thus be established. through a technological - psychometric type design with descriptive data analysis, a factor analysis is presented to determine which latent variables tend to charge significantly in order to assess the validity of the dimensions comprising the construct of capital structure and explore its dimensions in relation to financial theory. a 44-item questionnaire is adapted and applied to a sample of chief financial officers from diverse public and nonpublic companies in mexico. the analysis reveals the existence of four construct dimensions consistent with corporate financial theory. the model helps to explain how decision-makers react to uncertainty and environmental conditions, directly affecting the valuation of firm's losses or earnings. as evidenced by the results, application of the item response theory to the field of behavioral finance could open up new avenues to the study of cognitive biases, involved in the financial decision-making process. thus, this implies that behavioral finance can also be treated as “cognitive finance"". © jose anselmo perez reyes, montserrat reyna miranda, jorge vera-martinez, 2019."
"background: research often suffers from overspecialization, a practice nurtured in academia and reinforced by funders. indeed, investigators in household air pollution (hap) and water, sanitation and hygiene (wash), working in poor parts of the world, rarely interact despite having similar training and using similar methods to evaluate interventions in the same vulnerable populations. disappointing results from recent trials of improved cookstoves and traditional approaches to wash suggest the need for alternative approaches. objectives: we argue that bringing these two areas together would improve the effectiveness and efficiency of interventions to reduce the massive disease burden associated with hap and poor wash, including pneumonia and diarrhea, the leading killers of young children in low-income countries. results: hap and wash face similar challenges in designing, implementing, and securing the sustained and exclusive use of scalable interventions such as clean fuel and water. discussion: research can advance greater coordination of these areas by demonstrating their interactions and wider impacts on well-being as well as the potential for programmatic synergies. integrated solutions to clean households and communities can benefit from the contribution in multiple disciplines, including economics and policy analysis; business and finance; engineering and technology; lab sciences, environmental health, and biomedical sciences; and behavioral and implementation sciences. conclusion: there are compelling reasons to overcome the artificial and unproductive segregation of hap and wash. researchers should encourage integration by expanding the scope of their collaborations and projects. policy makers, funders, and implementers can help by supporting compre-hensive solutions, encouraging innovation, and requiring rigorous evaluations of their effects. © 2019, public health services, us dept of health and human services. all rights reserved."
"the paper investigates possible investment portfolio optimization considering behavioral errors. the research rationale is due to the adaption of the investment recommendations for unqualified investors on the russian stock market. in economic literature, the consequences of behavioral effects are not detailed enough when making a portfolio of russian securities. the aim of the article is to make the most optimal portfolio based on the risk/reward ratio. the author made a hypothesis on applying various periods of profitability analysis to improve profitability indicators and increase the subjective probability of its achievement. to build a portfolio model, the behavioral portfolio theory and its optimization through linear programming were used. the study was based on modeling the investment portfolio of the most liquid stocks on the russian stock market. modified elements of the cumulative prospect theory with behavioral coefficients were used as indicators of profitability and probability. based on the analysis results, the model of semi-annual portfolio analysis was proposed as a tool for portfolio optimization. the investor review of the portfolio semi-annual rate of profitability led to its best final index of effectiveness. in the medium-term assessment of portfolio profitability, the influence of behavioral factors decreases while maximizing returns with medium high risk. the research result is consistent with the basics of behavioral economics as the prospect theory regarding risk and loss aversion. moreover, the factor of frequency of access to information and the degree of naive portfolio diversification with high profitability are promising areas for the development of research in behavioral finance. however, determining by the investor the objective probability to achieve the expected return level by using specific benchmarks is controversial. © 2018 finance: theory and practice. all rights reserved."
"counterparty credit risk caused by the excessive expansion of credit derivatives is becoming more and more prominent. the study of evolution mechanism of its contagion will help the financial regulators set up a scientific and accessible prevention and control strategy. from the cross perspective of behavioral finance and information economics, this study analyzes the mechanism of counterparty credit risk contagion. based on the epidemic model, a network model of it is built with the consideration of investor behavior and information disclosure strategy. the network topology characteristics of it are analyzed in theory. meanwhile, this study analyzes the evolution characteristics of it in numerical simulation. the main conclusions are as follows: first, investor behavior or information disclosure strategy only affects counterparty credit risk contagion in local credit asset network, while it is gradually disappearing in global credit asset network. second, noise can enhance the impact intensity of investor behavior or information disclosure strategy on counterparty credit risk contagion, and lead to the spread of counterparty credit risk synchronously in local and global credit asset networks. third, information transmission rate has “local strengthening effect” on investor behavior. the timing of information release and the tendency of information disclosure exert a “global suppression effect” on the influence of investors, and the ability of investor information decision-making has a “local suppression effect” on the timing of information release and the tendency of information disclosure. through the comprehensive adjustment of investor behavior and information disclosure strategy, the goal of preventing and controlling counterparty credit risk contagion can be realized in local and global credit asset networks. © 2018 elsevier ltd"

"the effectiveness of monitoring and incentive alignment as mechanisms for controlling agency costs have been explored separately and in combination, with monitoring substituting for weaknesses in incentive alignment and vice versa; this equates to positive substitution when describing how monitoring and incentive alignment interact to influence shareholder agency costs. we draw upon behavioral agency theory and findings from finance research to offer further theoretical insight into how these mechanisms interact to influence agency costs. our results suggest that ceo earnings management aimed at preserving their equity wealth (an incentive alignment mechanism) is accentuated by higher levels of concentrated institutional ownership, thereby imposing agency costs on less informed investors. thus, in addition to being substitutes in controlling agency costs, as previously suggested, monitoring may accentuate the perverse effects of incentive alignment, equating to negative reinforcement, rather than positive substitution. yet this effect is negated in the absence of ceo power due to dual occupation of the board and ceo roles. we discuss implications of these findings for theory and practice. © the author(s) 2016."

"the purpose of this paper is to develop an exclusively stakeholder-based financial brand valuation approach. a semiotic model is used that recognizes three components in the brand: identity, object, and response. it is noted that the financial valuation purpose is to predict the influence of brand identity signs—the protectable trademarks as property rights—on the economic benefits of their owners. these benefits depend on the response of the stakeholders who are generators of cash-ins and cash-outs. in order to separate the “trademark influence,” stakeholders are confronted with a change scenario to a trademark that is unknown to them and asked if this change alters their behavioral response toward the brand. the affective response is also evaluated to establish the “influence of risk” in realizing the future benefits. this approach makes it possible to transform a rigorous concept from a legal and financial point of view, but one which is incomprehensible to the common stakeholder, to a scenario that the stakeholder can understand and respond to reliably. grounding the brand’s financial valuation in semiotics is relevant because it distinguishes legal, marketing, and finance perspectives about the same objective, by framing them in common concerns of objectivity and intelligibility. © 2019, academy of marketing science."
"the study examines the factors determining the innovation activity of small and medium-sized enterprises (smes) in hungary, focusing on certain elements of the financial-economic culture. while many researches focus on the innovation and research and development (r+d) activities of enterprises, there is a lack of analysis of the relationship between small business innovation and entrepreneurial finance behavior and attitudes. in this study, we examine different groups of smes based on their realized and short-term planned innovation activity. we get a picture not only of innovations, but we examine also the factors behind their failure. the study demonstrates whether ‒ beyond the basic corporate demographic and behavioral characteristics ‒ a decision to innovate is influenced by the entrepreneurs’ financial awareness and behavior. the examined influencing factors were the use of up-to-date financial products and services, the availability of different sources of finance, the planning of management and the soundness of financial management decisions. we also present how the market and socio-economic competition factors affect the decisions. for the analysis we used the data of a nationally representative survey prepared within the framework of our project in institute of sociology and social policy, budapest, corvinus university, entitled “financial culture in hungary”. the results of the multinomial logistic regression analysis point to the fact that the knowledge and creative use of new elements of financial culture among entrepreneurs (smes) is an important indicator of the competitiveness of the small business market. we also highlight the fact that the lack of internal provisioning and the inadequate foundation of corporate finance and management decisions are the main reasons for turning away from innovation. © 2019, hungarian sociological association. all rights reserved."

"clustered data are common in many fields. some prominent examples of clustering are employees clustered within supervisors, students within classrooms, and clients within therapists. many methods exist that explicitly consider the dependency introduced by a clustered data structure, but the multitude of available options has resulted in rigid disciplinary preferences. for example, those working in the psychological, organizational behavior, medical, and educational fields generally prefer mixed effects models, whereas those working in economics, behavioral finance, and strategic management generally prefer fixed effects models. however, increasingly interdisciplinary research has caused lines that separate the fields grounded in psychology and those grounded in economics to blur, leading to researchers encountering unfamiliar statistical methods commonly found in other disciplines. persistent discipline-specific preferences can be particularly problematic because (a) each approach has certain limitations that can restrict the types of research questions that can be appropriately addressed, and (b) analyses based on the statistical modeling decisions common in one discipline can be difficult to understand for researchers trained in alternative disciplines. this can impede cross-disciplinary collaboration and limit the ability of scientists to make appropriate use of research from adjacent fields. this article discusses the differences between mixed effects and fixed effects models for clustered data, reviews each approach, and helps to identify when each approach is optimal. we then discuss the within-between specification, which blends advantageous properties of each framework into a single model. © 2018 american psychological association."

"consumer finance refers to the saving, borrowing, and investment choices that households make over time. these financial decisions can be complex and can affect households’ financial well- being both now and in the future. safe andaffordable financial services are an important tool for most american households to avoid financial hardship, build assets, and achieve financial security over the course of their lives. understanding why and how consumers make financial decisions is important when considering policy issues in consumer financial markets. households borrow money for the following common reasons: investments—such as a home or education—to build future wealth, consumption smoothing (i.e., payinglater to consume things now), and emergency expenses. most households rely on credit to finance some of these expenses, because they do not have enough money saved to pay for them. according to the federal reserve bank of new york, mortgagedebt is by far the largest type of debt for households, accounting for approximately 67% of household debt. student debtis the second-largest household debt, followed by auto loans and credit cards. consumer financial markets generally share similar market dynamics. in all of these markets, consumers often act in similar ways when making financial decisions and firms tend to act in comparable ways to attract consumers. therefore, the government tends to consider similar policy interventions when regulating in these markets. competitive free markets generally lead to efficient distributions of goods and services to maximize value for society. yet sometimes, free markets are inefficient when particular issues arise. common issues in consumer financial markets include information asymmetries between financial firms and consumers and (2) behavioral biases that predictably bias consumers when making financial decisions. in these cases, government policy can potentially correct market failures to bring the market to a more efficient outcome, maximizing social welfare. in consumer finance, three types of policy interventions are common: (1) standardized consumer disclosures; (2) regulation to prevent deceptive, unfair, or abusive financial institution practices; and (3) regulation to prevent discriminationin consumer-lending markets. yet, policymakers need to be aware of unintended consequences of proposed policies, and often find it challenging to determine whether a policy intervention will help or harm a particular market’s efficiency. inresponse to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, the 2010 dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (dodd- frank; p.l. 111-203) established the bureau of consumer financial protection (cfpb) to implement and enforce federal consumer financial law while ensuring consumers can access financial products and services. the cfpb’s authorities fall into three broad categories: rulemaking, writing regulations to implement laws under its jurisdiction; supervision, the powerto examine and impose reporting requirements on financial institutions; and enforcement of various consumer protection laws and regulations. the cfpb generally has regulatory authority over providers of an array of consumer financial products and services. the major consumer financial markets include mortgage lending, student loans, automobile loans, credit cards and payments, payday loans and other credit alternative financial products, and checking accounts and substitutes.in addition, two important market structures allow these consumer financial products to be offered: (1) the consumer credit reporting system and (2) the debt collection market. these aspects of the consumer credit system facilitate the pricing of credit offers and the resolution of delinquent consumer credit products for most consumer credit markets. © 2020 by nova science publishers, inc. all rights reserved."
"financial intelligence has become a research hotspot in recent years with the development of behavioral finance which introduces the social emotion and behavior factors in the decision-making. the data mining technology is widely used in the research on financial intelligence. this paper collected the investors’ comments from social network sites (sns) by crawler technology and segmented each piece of comment into words by chinese text processing technology to build a financial sentiment lexicon. applying the sentiment lexicon, a sentiment computing model based on so-pmi algorithm was designed to compute the sentiment indices of the investors. finally, the paper made an empirical analysis through linear regression between the return of the stock and its investors’ sentiment index. the result proved that the sentiment indices based on the investors’ comments are better to measure the investors’ sentiment and can be used to predict the stock return. © springer nature switzerland ag 2019."
"traditional financial theories describe investors as rationalist entities but the speculations experienced cannot be explained by existing theories. behavioral finance argues that individual investors do not make rational financial decisions and that they are affected by their prejudices while making financial decisions. in this study, traditional finance theories, behavioral finance, psychological prejudices which are the subject matter of behavioral finance, individual investors and investment instruments, are discussed. literature review regarding the local and foreign researches has been done and some explanations have been made in the light of crucial information about the subject matter. the application part of the study consists of the subject, purpose, methodology, hypothesis, statistical data and analysis of the research. the questionnaires were applied to randomly selected. 1002 individual investors in istanbul and the obtained data were analyzed by factor analysis, i̇ndependent t test, one way variance analysis (anova) and post-hoc (tukey test) tests. the results of these analyses reveal that individual investors living in istanbul are not much rational while making investment preferences and that they are affected by the psychological prejudices. these results are in parallel with similar tests made in our country. © 2019 the authors. published by elsevier b.v."
"traditionally, fundamental factors of supply and demand were important in understanding oil price dynamics before the financial crisis. these factors, however, are no longer sufficient to explain the price behavior of the oil market in the post-financial crisis era since 2008. the financialization of oil futures markets has been responsible for changes in price behavior and co-movement between oil prices and financial asset prices, among others. the globalization of the world economy has further strengthened the interactions between oil markets and financial markets, which allows oil prices to exhibit more financial characteristics. this paper reviews current literature pertaining to financial factors affecting oil price change and the influence of oil prices on stock market returns and volatility. we conclude that the drivers of oil price change vary across different periods but the fundamentals remain the underlying causes affecting the long-term trend of oil prices. these financial factors are the important driving force for the extremely volatile oil price dynamics since the twenty-first century. when studying oil-stock interactions, it is important to consider a combined framework including the decomposition of oil price shocks, the asymmetry and time-varying effects of interaction, the impacts of structural changes and macroeconomic variables on the transmission of information, and risks in the oil-stock nexus. finally, future research directions relating factors affecting oil price and the oil-stock nexus are highlighted. specifically, the application of behavioral finance theory helps to explain the mechanism of oil price dynamics from a microperspective. the effect of changes in energy consumption structure and climate policies should be taken into account in understanding oil price change. using of implied volatility index in the oil market and the stock market may provide new insight into the oil-stock nexus. © 2018, springer nature b.v."
"in this article, we make several contributions to the literature on appraisal rights and similar cases in which courts assign values to a company's shares in the litigation context. first, we applaud the recent trend in delaware cases to consider the market prices of the stock of the company being valued if that stock trades in an efficient market, and we defend this market-oriented methodology against claims that recent discoveries in behavioral finance indicate that share prices are unreliable due to various cognitive biases. next, we propose that the framework and methodology for utilizing market prices be clarified. we maintain that courts should look at the market price of thc securities of a target company whose shares are being valued, unadjusted for thc rinws of the merger, rather than at the deal price that was reached by the parties in the transaction. in our view, unadjusted market price has two distinct advantages over deal price. first, the unadjusted market price automatically subtracts the target firm's share of the synergy gains and agency cost reductions impounded in the deal price. this is appropriate to do because dissenting shareholders in appraisal proceedings are not entitled to these increments of value that are supplied by the bidder and it is difficult to accurately ascertain the proportion of the deal price that is attributable to these increments of value. second, the unadjusted market price is unaffected by any flaws in the deal process that led to the ultimate merger agreement. recently, commentators have contended that deal prices in merger transactions should be ignored in appraisal cases where there are flaws in the process that led to the sale. however, flaws in the sales process are not reflected in the unadjusted market price, so such prices are valid indicators of value, regardless of whether there were flaws in the deal process. further, no deal process is perfect, and ignoring market prices when a deal process is flawed succumbs to what economists call the nirvana fallacy, which posits that an analytical approach (such as relying on market prices) should not be ignored or abandoned even if using that approach does not produce perfect results. rather, an analytical approach should be used if it is better than the available alternatives and provides useful information to a tribuil or policymiaker. finally, wc exterid our analysis of market efficiency to a new domain. we point out that market prices can be used even when shares of non-publicly traded target companies are being evaluated to determine whether the acquirer paid a fair price in certain cases by examining the share price performance of the acquirer's shares. in cases where a bidder has paid an unfairly low price for the target's shares due to self-dealing, incompetence, or inattention on the part of the seller, the acquirer's stock should react positively to the announcement of the transaction if the transaction is significant. in thc absecic of such a positive share price reaction on the part of the acquirer, the price should bc dcemed presumptively fair. this analysis seems particularly apt in situations where there is a dc line in the value of the bidder's stock upon announcement of an acquisition. © 2019 american bar association. all rights reserved."
"prediction of financial and economic markets is very challenging but valuable for economists, business owners, and traders. forecasting stock market prices depends on many factors, such as other markets’ performance, economic state of a country, and others. in behavioral finance, people’s emotions and opinions influence their transactional decisions and therefore the financial markets. the focus of this research is to predict the saudi stock market index by utilizing its previous values and the impact of people’s sentiments on their financial decisions. human emotions and opinions are directly influenced by media and news, which we incorporated by utilizing the global data on events, location, and tone (gdelt) dataset by google. gdelt is a collection of news from all over the world from different types of media such as tv, broadcasts, radio, newspapers, and websites. we extracted two time series from gdelt, filtered for saudi arabian news. the two time series represent daily values of tone and social media attention. we studied the characteristics of the generated multivariate time series, then deployed and compared multiple multivariate models to predict the daily index of the saudi stock market. © 2019, springer nature switzerland ag."
"this paper explores the nature of and the dangers posed by household indebtedness in thailand. it utilises three levels of models to characterise savings and consumption behavior-first, the n eoclassical m odels o f the life-cycle hypothesis and the permanent income hypothesis; second, the asymmetric information models of credit rationing; and, finally, the behavioral finance models, which suggest that at least some consumers will act in non-rational ways. we find that the neoclassical models are supported by the evidence from thailand. secured income and sufficient saving allow households to improve their debt performance and reduce their chances of being over-indebted; whereas a higher level of dependency on finance can lead to a higher probability of being over-indebted. we also find that, for some borrowers, credit constraints are binding in the formal market for loans, which leads those borrowers to enter the gray market. finally, we find that higher financial literacy is also correlated with superior debt performance. this raises issues about improving the level of financial literacy for thai households. © 2019 chulalognkorn university. all rights reserved."
"the aim of the study is to conduct a bibliometric analysis of the scientific field of behavioral economics and behavioral finance. the research was conducted using the web of science database, which returned 2617 articles, revealing that the amount of research within these fields has grown over time. furthermore, the results also prove the relevance of the works of daniel kahneman and amos tversky for the field of behavioral economics and finance, and steven hursh to behavioral economics. it is still possible to note that the field of behavioral economics encompasses subjects that connect human behavior with demand, consumption and price, with investments and with managerial decisions, as well as with the role played by heuristics and cognitive biases in decision-making processes. in turn, the field of behavioral finance is more focused on the study of errors of judgment and of decision-making characteristics in financial investments. additionally, it is inferred that the field of behavioral economics is more wide-ranging than the field of behavioral finance, as the latter is a byproduct of behavioral economics. finally, a conclusion is then reached, demonstrating that the fields of behavioral economics and finance have turned into an important field of study. © 2018 john wiley & sons ltd."

"stock volatility is influenced by the release, dissemination, and acceptance of information. rumor clarification is expected to reduce asymmetric information and abnormal stock returns by increasing information transparency. however, investors are irrational, and modern behavioral finance studies attribute non-random stock movements to investors’ cognitive and emotional biases. the verification of rumor authenticity may cause fluctuations in investor sentiment, which increases impulsive investing behaviors and stock movements. due to the widespread and fast accessibility of social media, many electronic information platforms have been established to clarify rumors. it is critical to understand the effects of digitalized rumor clarification on stock markets. in this study, we extracted 12,663 rumor-clarification pairs from 1,804,520 social media posts. we quantified the language used in these messages via sentiment analysis, along with online firm behaviors, to study the effect of clarifications on stock markets. our findings are as follows: (1) digitalized rumor-clarification messages affect the abnormal returns of relevant stocks. (2) this influence can be quantified and measured by the emotion polarity of rumor clarification. (3) firms’ online clarification behaviors, including information disclosure frequency, response time, and wording, have limited to no influence on abnormal returns. ©, copyright © taylor & francis group, llc."
"mainstream economics textbooks focus too much on neoclassical mod-els (with perfect competition as reference model) while the mainstream research practice is much more diverse and closer to the real world and political issues. pro-gress was made in microeconomics by new insights particularly from behavioral and experimental economics and new tools such as simulations and network analy-sis. in macroeconomics, however, the dominant dynamic stochastic general equi-librium (dsge) models have structurally4iled to predict the global crisis. their enhancement by the inclusion of an explicit financial sector is on top of the main-stream reform agenda. islamic economics may benefit from the innovations in mi-croeconomics, while the macroeconomic reform agenda is of limited relevance as long as the market share of islamic finance remains quite low in most muslim countries. a dialogue on reform between mainstream and islamic economics should take into account that islamic economists underline the importance of the qur'ān and sunnah as the primary sources of positive and normative knowledge, while secular mainstream rejects proofs of positive statements by reference to di-vine sources. this may become a severe methodological obstacle for more plural-ism in economics. © 2019 king abdulaziz university."
"the article examines the impact of the policy of the usa quantitative easing and the euro area on the nominal eur/ usd exchange rate. after the economic crisis of 2008-2009, the policy of quantitative easing gained popularity among the world's largest economies. the largest programs were implemented by the us federal reserve (us federal reserve system) and the european central bank (ecb). however, the impact of the actual purchase volume of securities on the eur/usd exchange rate within these policies has been little studied in modern literature. the author collected the data from 1999 to 2018 on the exchange rate, macroeconomic and market indicators, and calculated the monthly actual purchase volumes of securities under the asset purchase program of the united states and the euro area. the behavioral equilibrium exchange rate model was used. the linear model specification and the error correction model identified no significant impact of the ecb quantitative easing policy expressed in the actual purchase volume of securities. however, for some specifications, it has been proven that the increase in purchases of securities by the us federal reserve leads to a weakening of the dollar against the euro. the cointegration test revealed a long-term dependence of the eur/usd exchange rate on the accumulated volumes of acquired assets. thus, an increase in the purchase volume of securities led to a weakening of the dollar against the euro. the insignificant impact of the european central bank quantitative easing policy could have been caused by market expectations formed prior to the actual purchase of ecb securities in the market. © 2018 finance: theory and practice. all rights reserved."
"background: musculoskeletal problems substantially impact the demand for and the finances of the united kingdom's national health service. some of this demand and cost could be alleviated if patients use self-directed-exercises. the present study aims first to establish whether general practitioners already recommend self-directed-exercises and second to describe barriers and facilitators to making such recommendations. method: the design of the current study included surveys and interviews. the surveys were designed to draw out participants' tendency to recommend self-directed-exercises and their behavioral drivers to do so. the drivers investigated include 14 domains described by the theoretical domains framework. the surveys were completed online and the responses were analyzed using descriptive reports and regression analyses. the interviews were designed to more fully understand participants' experiences recommending self-directed-exercises according to the same framework. the interviews were audio-taped, transcribed, and thematically analyzed. results: the survey found that the following domains significantly predicted participants' tendency to recommend self-directed-exercises: environmental contexts and resources, goals, intentions, knowledge, memory attention and decision processes, and social/professional role. the interviews brought out four themes that could be leveraged to increase general practitioners' tendency to recommend self-directed-exercises: (1) practitioners' beliefs about self-directed-exercises being effective, (2) patients' motivations to engage in self-directed-exercises, (3) time constraints, and (4) the ease with which practitioners can recommend self-directed-exercises. conclusions: most general practitioners already recommend self-directed-exercises, though they note significant barriers that may prevent them from doing so. general practitioners' tendency to recommend self-directed-exercises would be bolstered by creating a respected central resource of exercise pamphlets. these pamphlets should clearly describe how different self-directed-exercises should be performed and evidence supporting their effectiveness. © 2018 the author(s)."
"behavioral finance is an aspect of research that attempts to understand and explain how reasoning errors influence the investor's decisions. investment preference mainly focuses upon how investor scrutinizes and acts on information to take investment decisions. the study tries to elucidate the very factor that is ""cognitive psychology: the study of how people (including investors) think, reason, and make decisions"". it reveals that individuals do not always act shrewdly when it comes to making financial decisions and that their behaviors influences them in making investment choices. the sample size of the study is 61 employees of construction companies in mysuru city. the sampling technique used was simple random sampling. primary data was been used in the study, which was collected through structured questionnaire which is prepared based on behavioral finance and investment preference. various statistical tools was employed for analyzing the data like descriptive statistics, t-test statistical tool, correlation tool and percentage analysis. the study tried to understand the irrational decisions taken by the investors during the time of investing in a specific avenue. through the study, it is discerned that construction employees of mysuru city are aware about the various possibilities in investments and it is found that there exist a relationship between behavioral finance and investment preference among employees of construction companies. using the principles of behavioral finance and investment preference the study tried to delve the psychological concept of ""individual attachment style"", especially with reference to employees of construction companies and the wide range of investment avenues and their investment preference procedure. © 2018 iaeme publication."
"in this paper, we attempt to give an algorithmic explanation to volatility clustering, one of the most exploited stylized facts in finance. our analysis with daily data from five exchanges shows that financial volatilities follow levin's universal distribution kirchherr et al. (1997) once transformed into equally proportional binary strings. frequency ranking of binary trading weeks coincides with that of their kolmogorov complexity estimated by delahaye et al. (2012). according to levin's universal distribution, large (resp. small) volatilities are more likely to be followed by large (resp. small) ones since simple trading weeks such as ""00000"" or ""11111"" are much more frequently observed than complex ones such as ""10100"" or ""01011"". thus, volatility clusters may not be attributed to behavioral or micro-structural assumptions but to the complexity discrepancy between finite strings. this property of financial data could be at the origin of volatility autocorrelation, though autocorrelated volatilities simulated from generalized auto-regressive conditional heteroskedacity (hereafter garch) cannot be transformed into universally distributed binary weeks. © 2018 by the authors."

"background and objectives: chronic pain is a highly prevalent and potentially disabling condition in veterans who have had a traumatic brain injury (tbi) and access to non-pharmacological pain treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy is limited and variable. the purpose of this randomized controlled trial (rct) is to evaluate the efficacy of a telephone-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (t-cbt) for pain in veterans with a history of tbi. methods: veterans with a history of tbi and chronic pain of at least six months duration (n = 160) will be randomized to either t-cbt or a telephone-delivered pain psychoeducational active control condition (t-ed). the eight-week t-cbt intervention builds on other efficacious cbt interventions for chronic pain in the general population but is novel in that it is conducted via telephone and adapted for veterans with a history of tbi. outcome variables will be collected pre, mid-, and post-treatment, and 6 months following randomization (follow-up). projected outcomes: in addition to evaluating the effects of the interventions on pain intensity (primary outcome), this study will determine their effects on pain interference, sleep, depression, and life satisfaction. we will also examine potential moderators of treatment outcomes such as cognition, ptsd, and alcohol and drug use. this non-pharmacologic one-on-one therapeutic intervention has the potential to reduce pain and pain-related dysfunction, improve access to care, and reduce barriers associated with geography, finances, and stigma, without the negative effects on physical and cognitive performance and potential for addiction as seen with some pharmacologic treatments for pain. this trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov, protocol nct01768650 © 2018"
"financial time series often tend to show obvious volatility clustering. selecting the daily closing data of the shanghai composite index from january 2008 to april 2018, we first test the arch effect, and then establish the egarch model adding asymmetric item to the conditional variance equation. our findings indicate that in the past decade the fluctuation of china’s stock price has performed a long-lasting clustering phenomenon. at the same time, “bad news” causes the fluctuation of stock price to be greater than that of “good news”. the reason is that chinese stock market is characterized by a large number of retail investors, and the investment income mainly comes from the bid-offer gaps of stock prices. investors’ philosophy is over-speculative, short-term and herding. we combine the prospect theory of behavioral finance and find that certainty effect and loss aversion can well explain the empirical results of the egarch model. © springer nature switzerland ag 2019."
"understanding how people behave when facing hazardous situations, how intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence the risk taking (rt) decision making process and to what extent it is possible to modify their reactions externally, are questions that have long interested academics and society in general. in the spheres, among others, of occupational safety and health (osh), the military, finance and sociology, this topic has multidisciplinary implications because we all constantly face rt situations. researchers have hitherto assessed rt profiles by conducting questionnaires prior to and after the presentation of stimuli; however, this can lead to the production of biased, non-realistic, rt profiles. this is due to the reflexive nature of choosing an answer in a questionnaire, which is remote from the reactive, emotional and impulsive decision making processes inherent to real, risky situations. one way to address this question is to exploit vr capabilities to generate immersive environments that recreate realistic seeming but simulated hazardous situations. we propose vr as the next-generation tool to study rt processes, taking advantage of the big four families of metrics which can provide objective assessment methods with high ecological validity: the real-world risks approach (high presence vr environments triggering real-world reactions), embodied interactions (more natural interactions eliciting more natural behaviors), stealth assessment (unnoticed real-time assessments offering efficient behavioral metrics) and physiological real-time measurement (physiological signals avoiding subjective bias). additionally, vr can provide an invaluable tool, after the assessment phase, to train in skills related to rt due to its transferability to real-world situations. © 2018 de-juan-ripoll, soler-domínguez, guixeres, contero, álvarez gutiérrez and alcañiz."
"purpose: the purpose of this paper is to investigate the existence of behavioral biases, disposition effect and house money effect in investment decisions of defined benefit pension funds. it investigates the determinants of portfolios by examining whether pensions display risk seeking or risk aversion behavior in reaction to prior gains and losses. design/methodology/approach: the first research question is to examine the impact of prior period’s return and αs on existing portfolio allocation in equity, debt, real estate and other assets. in order to test this relationship, four separate regressions are estimated using the pooled data. regression helps in examining the relationship between prior gains with current allocation in four categories of assets of varying degrees of riskiness (stocks, debt, real estate and other assets). in order to investigate the second research question on whether pension funds increase (decrease) their investments in risky (safer) assets due to prior gains and αs, the four variables representing the changes in portfolio allocation for each asset class over one period are employed. these changes in allocation are regressed against the prior year’s actual return, expected return, αs and a set of control variables. findings: the results suggest significant negative (positive) relationship between prior positive returns and αs with portfolio allocation in risky (safer) assets. also, there is an increased (decreased) investment in safer (risky) assets following prior period’s positive returns and αs. the findings confirm the existence of disposition effect, while there is no evidence of house money effect. originality/value: the portfolio allocation of pension plans provides unique setting to investigate the relevance of behavioral finance and examine the role of psychological biases on risk taking. this study attempts to contribute to the literature by empirically investigating whether the tenets of behavioral finance are relevant in defined benefit pension fund’s portfolio allocation decisions. specifically, it focuses on the determinants of portfolio choices by directly investigating pension funds’ reaction to prior period’s actual as well as risk adjusted return (or αs – the difference between the actual and expected return). © 2018, emerald publishing limited."

"the paper aims to examine relationships between search-based sentiment and stock market reactions in vietnam. this study constructs an internet search-based measure of sentiment and examines its relationship with vietnamese stock market returns. the sentiment index is derived from google trends' search volume index of financial and economic terms that vietnamese searched from january 2011 to june 2018. consistent with prediction from sentiment theories, the study documents significant short-term reversals across three major stock indices. the difference from previous literature is that vietnam stock market absorbs the contemporaneous decline slower while the subsequent rebound happens within a day. the results of the study suggest that the sentiment-induced effect is mainly driven by pessimism. on the other hand, optimistic investors seem to delay in taking their investment action until the market corrects. the study proposes a unified explanation for our findings based on the overreaction hypothesis of the bearish group and the strategic delay of the optimistic group. the findings of the study contribute to the behavioral finance strand that studies the role of sentiment in emerging financial markets, where noise traders and limits to arbitrage are more obvious. they also encourage the continuous application of search data to explore other investor behaviors in securities markets. © kodisa."
"starting in the 1980s, financial liberalization and technological developments have enabled individual investors to participate in financial markets and carry out easy transactions. with these developments, academics began to wonder how the individual investors decide to invest and what factors affect these decisions. according to traditional finance theory, it is suggested that markets are efficient and investors show rational behaviors in their financial purchasing decisions. however, in many studies conducted in recent years, it was determined that investors included emotional elements as well as rational elements in their decision-making process and therefore exhibited irrational behaviors by believing rumors instead of real information. it is thought that many factors such as personal characteristics, psychological factors, demographic and socio-economic factors play a role in the behavior of investors in purchasing a financial product. in this study, the importance of herd behavior, which is one of the psychological factors that play a very important role in financial markets, on financial product purchasing process is examined in the light of the behavioral finance theory. it is thought that information included in the study will be useful for researchers who want to study herd behavior and for those who are interested in the subject. © 2019 by emerald publishing limited all rights of reproduction in any form reserved."

"behavioral finance believes that investor behavior will be influenced by psychological factors, while investor behavior has a direct impact on asset pricing. this paper selected the monthly data of shanghai and shenzhen exchange a shares from january 2016 to december 2016 by simple random sampling. we defined media variable as the number of media coverage which is obtained from baidu’s news search engine and established a panel model. we tried to explore the influence of media coverage on investor sentiment and stock returns, and to see which effect is more significant among the stock groups with different degree of media coverage. a pretest of simple correlations reveals the number of media reports lagged behind the first phase negatively affects the stock return rate of this period. the result shows that there is an “attention driven effect” in the low- middle level of media coverage group, the “media effect” exists in the middle-high level of media coverage group and the “media effect” exists in chinese stock market through single factor analysis of variance. moreover, this paper classifies the samples with control variables and shows that the media effect is significant. © springer nature switzerland ag 2019."
"neurofinance is a relatively new area of research that strives to understand financial decision making by combining insights from psychology and neuroscience with theories of finance. using behavioral experiments, neurofinance studies how we evaluate information about financial options that are uncertain, time-constrained, risky, and strategic in nature and how financial decisions are influenced by emotions, psychological biases, stress, and individual differences (such as gender, genes, neuroanatomy, and personality). in addition, it studies how the brain processes financial information and how individual decisions arise within it. finally, by combining these experiments with computational models, neurofinance aims to provide an alternative explanation for the apparent failure of classic finance theories. here we provide an introduction to neurofinance and look at how it is rooted in different fields of study. we review early findings and implications and conclude with open questions in neurofinance. © the author(s) 2017."
"in china, the growth enterprise market (gem) is a brand new market that provides an additional way of financing for firms with good growth potential. whereas there has been a massive amount of stocks breaking on the first trading day since 2010, the risk of ipo’s overpricing in china’s gem has drawn more and more attention in recent years. based on the theory of behavioral finance and limited attention, investors’ attention may be a quite indicative determinant to the ipo overpricing. accordingly, we collected data from internet including online stock forums and search engines, then built multiple investors’ attention metrics that were distinct to the traditional metrics from the offline stock market. in the empirical study, we built regression models to dig out the determinants of ipo’s overpricing and found that the hybrid model containing both online metrics and financial metrics outperformed the others considerably. the adjusted r-square of the hybrid model containing both online metrics and financial metrics is as high as 82.8%, in contrast to 18.2% for the model containing only the financial metrics and 59.3% for that containing only investors’ attention. © 2017, springer-verlag gmbh germany."
"the cornerstone of modern finance is the efficient market hypothesis. under this hypothesis all information available about a financial asset is immediately incorporated into its price dynamics by fully rational investors. in contrast to this hypothesis many studies have pointed out behavioral biases in investors. recently it has become possible to access databases that track the trading decisions of investors. studies of such databases have shown that investors acting in a financial market are highly heterogeneous among them, and that heterogeneity is a common characteristic of many financial markets. the article describes an empirical study of the daily trading decisions of all finnish investors investing nokia stock over a time period of 15 years. the investigation is performed by adapting and using methods and tools in network science. by investigating daily trading decisions, and by constructing the time-evolution of statistically validated networks of investors, clusters of investors—and their time evolution— which are characterized by similar trading profiles are detected. these clusters are performing distinct trading decisions on time scales ranging from several months to twelve years. these empirical observations show the presence of an ecology of groups of investors characterized by different attributes and by various investment styles over many years. some of the detected clusters present a persistent over-expression of specific investor categories. the study shows that the logarithm of the ratio of pairs of statistically validated trading decisions is different for different values of the market volatility. these findings suggest that an ecology of investors is present in financial markets and that groups of traders are always competing, adopting, using and eventually discarding new investment strategies. this adaptation process is observed over a multiplicity of time scales, and is compatible with several conclusions of behavioral finance and with the assumptions of the so-called adaptive market hypothesis. © 2018, the author(s)."
"the study sought to apply the model developed by gokhale et al. (2015) to identify the existence of overreaction and behavioral biases in the brazilian stock market and analyze its performance as an investment strategy on the são paulo stock, commodities, and futures exchange (bm&fbovespa) in the short term and long term, as well as test its robustness with time window simulations. the impacts of behavioral finance on capital markets can affect economic decisions, perpetuate or increase asset pricing anomalies, and in more extreme and persistent situations contribute to the formation of bubbles that can compromise the entire financial system of a country. the study pioneers an innovative methodology in the brazilian stock market for identifying behavioral biases and obtaining abnormal returns and higher returns than the ibovespa. the research uses the model developed by gokhale, tremblay, and tremblay (2015) in three samples with quotations data for brazilian publicly-traded companies that compose the ibovespa and ibra in the period from 2005 to 2016. with the r statistical software, the fundamental valuation index (fvi) was calculated for each sample share and each year. from the fvi index, the undervalued shares were identified, indicating that the sales price does not reflect their economic fundamentals, and portfolio simulations were carried out for investment over three months or the next year. the results indicate the possible existence of overreaction and behavioral biases in the brazilian stock market, which lead to the possibility of higher abnormal returns than those of the ibovespa. similar to the us market, at the end of the 2006-2016 period simulated portfolios yielded more than 274%, while the ibovespa yielded approximately 80%. the robustness tests attest to the effectiveness of the model. the various investment portfolios, simulated over different time horizons, yielded more than the ibovespa on average. the study also confirmed the assumptions of gokhale, tremblay, and tremblay (2015) regarding the models inadequacy for short-term strategies. © 2019 universidade de sao paulo. all rights reserved."
"a well-developed stock market has its impact on the development of economy. it provides investors with an array of assets with varying degree of risk, return and liquidity. this increased choice of assets and the existence of a vibrant stock market provide savers with more liquidity and options, thereby inducing more savings. increased competition from foreign financial institutions also paves the way for the derivatives’ market. all this, according to the mainstream belief, encourages more savings in equity related instruments. this, in turn, raises the domestic savings rate and improves capital formation. savings form an important part of any nation. with the savings invested in various options available to the people, the money acts as a drive for growth of the economy. indian financial scene too presents a surplus of avenues to the investor. though certainly not best or deepest of markets in the world, it has reasonable options for an ordinary man to invest his savings. one needs to invest and earn return on their idle resources and generate a specified sum of money for a specific goal in life and make a provision for uncertain future. one of the important reasons why one needs to invest wisely is to meet cost of inflation. inflation is the rate at which cost of living increases. behavioral finance theories contend that investors in financial markets do not always behave rationally. moreover, the departures from full rationality assumed by conventional finance theories are often systematic. this has motivated substantial empirical research over the past decades to understand how investors actually behave, what affects their trading decisions, and how they perform. the objectives of the study are to understand in depth different investment avenues available for investors, to study the influence of age on the choice of investment avenue (ia) and to know the risk tolerance level of investors of different age group. © tjprc pvt. ltd."
"in this chapter our objective was to gain an understanding of what affects maltese individuals’ behaviors when it comes to retirement planning. given that longevity is on the increase, state pension income is limited (and most probably unsustainable over the long term) and that many individuals expect to be able to enjoy a comfortable retirement, it sets out to determine which macro-and micro-environmental factors are likely to encourage positive behavior or otherwise. we did this by consulting and analyzing existing literature in chapter 8 of this book and designing an online survey which was specifically created to capture qualitative data about public sentiment and behaviors with respect to retirement planning. the study identifies a general sense of confusion in relation to financial concepts related to retirement. in line with other countries’ findings, the prevalence of myopia, procrastination and inertia has also been observed through the research undertaken. through established behavioral finance theories and literature, as well as actual european practical examples, the research explores the best ways of “nudging” people into recognizing the importance of acting and making the right long-term financial decisions, to their own benefit and to that of society. notwithstanding, that overall savings of the maltese are around the average established for europe, the study found that savings tend to be shorter term, and therefore insignificant when considering the actual requirements for the desired quality of life at retirement. the research showed how, as with other countries, behavioral biases have been limiting people from acting or making the right choices. of the most prominent of behaviors, procrastination, myopia, and inertia were observed. in the local market, these seemed to stem from a sense of disorientation as to the meaning of certain concepts, how to initiate the process and which actions to take. in fact, although many did not admit it outright, respondents showed low levels of confidence in their abilities, and avoid acting out of fear that it may not be the right choice. at the same time, they would try to rationalize their lack of action by the premise that things would sort themselves out, although this is typically labeled as overconfidence, it is likely to be an attempt to feel better about their stance on the matter. © 2019 by emerald publishing limited all rights of reproduction in any form reserved."
"purpose: the purpose of this paper is to investigate whether the interaction between sentiments and past prices can lead to higher abnormal profit in futures markets. such examinations allow the authors to relate the paper to the debate that focuses on examining the behavior of different types of traders in futures market, and who among these traders destabilize the markets. design/methodology/approach: first, the authors develop new dynamic strategies in us futures market that combine sentiment by type of traders based on trader position provided by the disaggregated commitments of traders with short-term contrarian signals. next, the authors adjust the abnormal profits to the capm model and miffre and rallis’s (2007) model. finally, the authors use the du (2012) decomposition methodology. findings: the main findings are that the abnormal profit is more pronounced when the authors combine past returns with lagged high producer/merchant/processor/user or low managed money sentiment. the results from swap dealer or other reportable groups show that there is no pervasive directional relation between their sentiment and contrarian profit. a further investigation of the sources of abnormal profits demonstrates that these profits survive even after the adjustment of obtained return to risk. instead, these profits are mainly due to the overreaction to the news by irrational traders. originality/value: based on behavioral finance theories, the authors conclude that producer, merchant, processor and user behave like irrational traders, while managed money traders behave like rational ones. given that current regulatory proposes the limitation of speculation, the policy implications of these results are important. therefore, these findings suggest that policy distinctions on trading motives may be more challenging to construct than ever. © 2018, emerald publishing limited."
"the housing boom of the mid-2000s saw the widespread popularization of non-occupant housing investment as an entrepreneurial activity within u.s. capitalism. in 2005, approximately one sixth of all mortgage-financed home purchases in the united states were for investment purposes. this article develops a sociological account that links the geographic distribution of popular investment to the social and institutional organization of communities. regression analyses of 1,566 municipalities from 2000 to 2006 indicate that non-occupant investment (but not conventional owner-occupant investment) occurred at significantly greater rates in places where local development institutions were organized in accordance with laissez-faire principles to a greater degree, where economic activities in other domains were less locally embedded in place, and where greater residential instability produced more tenuous connections between residents and places. the magnitudes of these associations suggest that social organization and cultural-institutional conditions were at least as informative as variations in housing price appreciation in shaping the incidence of investor activity during the bubble. social organization also moderated the behavioral effects of price appreciation. the article advances research on locally-embedded bases of economic action by examining how community environments provide more or less fertile ground for mass-participatory housing speculation and instrumental orientations toward places as exchange-values. © american sociological association 2018."
"we study the forecast accuracy and efficiency of popular “binary” prediction markets. such markets forecast probabilities for future states of the world (e.g., election winners) by paying off $0 or $1 depending on the realized state (e.g., who actually wins). to assess accuracy, forecast probabilities must be compared to realization frequencies, not individual realizations. we use iowa electronic market (iem) data to test efficiency against two alternative propositions from behavioral finance: the longshot bias and the overconfidence bias (which yield opposing predictions). no longshot bias appears in iem markets. nor does overconfidence influence prices at short horizons. however, overconfident traders may bias prices at intermediate horizons. while the markets are efficient at short horizons, non-market data indicate some intermediate-horizon inefficiency. we calculate sharpe ratios for static trading strategies and document returns for dynamic trading strategies to assess the economic content of the inefficiencies. © 2018 international institute of forecasters"
"this study aims to explore the impact of a number of prominent behavioral finance variables covered by the financial literature (overconfidence, loss aversion, risk perception and herding) that may affect the stock investment decision-making at amman stock exchange (ase), as well as determining which of these variables has the relative importance. the importance of this study stems from the fact that local studies focusing on the issue of behavioral finance are rare and therefore, the researchers expect that such study will enrich awareness in this domain. the study consisted of 165 individual investors who were active in the trading halls at amman stock exchange during the research period. the data were collected through a questionnaire prepared for the purpose of research and were analyzed by applying multiple statistical tests (multiple regression and hierarchal regression analysis) and by using statistical software (spss) after approving the reliability and validity of the questionnaire. the results showed that there was an impact of the behavioral finance at amman stock exchange represented by three behavioral factors affecting the investment decisions of the individual investors which were: overconfidence, loss aversion, and herding, the results also showed that the variable overconfidence had the most relative significance. the research provided some recommendations for investors trading at ase to adopt scientific bases in making stock investment decisions, and suggested to conduct further research to study the impact of behavioral finance on the different types of risks and yields at ase. © 2019 academy of accounting and financial studies journal."
"the somatic marker hypothesis is one of the more dominant physiological models of human decision-making and yet is seldom applied to decision-making in financial investment scenarios. this study provides preliminary evidence about the application of the somatic marker hypothesis in investment choices using heart rate and skin conductance response measures. twenty undergraduate students were split equally into expert (defined by familiarity with investments) and novice (no familiarity) groups, because previous research has associated expertise with cognitive differences in decision making scenarios. both groups completed the balloon analogue risk task and behavioral investment allocation strategy task computerized simulation of real trading scenarios as assessments of investment decision-making in conditions of low versus high uncertainty, as defined by the bayesian calculation (level of certainty is more than: (1 (300%))/(300%(300%)) 66.67% (0.67). results suggest that, although primary inducers (innate physiological responses) support and guide optimal decision-making in conditions of uncertainty, secondary inducers (physiological responses dependent on memory/experience) moderate this effect; that is, the stressful thoughts that accompany the task restrict optimal decision-making. this study contributes to the current knowledge on why emotions in finance can lead people to suboptimal decisions. © 2018 american psychological association."

"one of the natural consequences of lending practices by banks and credit institutions has been the creation of deferred and doubtful loans- a phenomenon that has become a major concern for these institutions and has had a negative impact on their revenue and expenditure. from an internal perspective, operating costs, work efficiency, profitability, customer service, branch rank, employee wages and salaries, and other qualitative indicators are significantly affected. from an external perspective, these loans lead to slow cash flow, lack of timely and optimal allocation of resources to manufacturing networks and industries, low employment rates, and eventually economic recession. the purpose of this research is to cluster bank customers and determine the behavioral pattern of each cluster for supply chain finance using k-means, fcm, and sub cluster models in clementine 18.0, matlab 2016, and excel software. 35 models were compared with a variety of parameters. after removing nonessential variables, the models were rerun and the outputs for each customer cluster were provided. the results showed that creditworthiness, education, job, collateral value, collateral type, loan term, and age respectively had the greatest impact. finally, the k-means model was found to be the most appropriate clustering technique. © excelingtech pub, uk."
"purpose: this study draws on behavioral finance and signaling theory to investigate market reactions to chinese acquirers when they made premium payments in large cross-border acquisitions. paying high premiums has been considered an inferior acquisition decision that engenders negative market reactions in previous studies examining western acquirers. moving beyond previous work, this paper aims to propose that the premiums paid by chinese firms in large international acquisitions will yield positive market reactions. design/methodology/approach: this paper applies an event study method and tests hypotheses on a sample that comprises large international acquisitions made by chinese acquirers between 2007 and 2012. findings: the acquisition premium paid by a chinese acquirer in a large cross-border acquisition positively affects its stock market return to the acquisition announcement. that is, investors rely on the managers’ judgment about the synergistic and value-creating potential of the acquisitions, as inferred from the premiums paid. moreover, it was found that the relationship between acquisition premiums and stock market returns is moderated by whether the transactions are tender offers, in that the positive relationship is weaker when acquisitions are tender offers. originality/value: different from previous research focusing on western companies and proposing a negative linkage between premiums paid and investor reactions to the acquisitions, this study sheds light on chinese acquirers who paid premiums in large international acquisitions and, based on the logic of behavioral finance and signaling theory, posits a positive association in the context of chinese acquirers. © 2018, emerald publishing limited."

"purpose: the purpose of this paper is to analyze the role of four different incentives in improving hedging effectiveness and propose an alternative regulatory mechanism for china’s futures market. design/methodology/approach: the research method that this study uses is a laboratory experiment, and this study follows the basic norms of experimental research. in addition, this paper designs and conducts a game experiment between hedgers and futures brokerage firms (fbfs) under different incentive mechanisms. findings: by analyzing the experimental data, it is found that compared with other incentive mechanisms, hedgers’ willingness to hedge and fbfs’ regulatory intention are both significantly higher for the dynamic linkage updating mechanism, indicating that hedgers have a stronger willingness to follow their hedging plan, and fbfs are more responsible for their regulatory behaviors. additionally, the dynamic linkage updating mechanism has a long-term impact on effective hedging in the futures market. research limitations/implications: the findings suggest that the dynamic linkage updating mechanism is beneficial for effectively restricting both hedgers’ over-speculation and fbfs’ regulatory slack and improving the hedging efficiency of the futures market. practical implications: to solve the problem of inefficient hedging in china’s futures market, i.e., hedgers’ over-speculation and fbfs’ passive collusion with hedgers, the regulators of china’s futures market should reform the existing incentives and adopt a dynamic linkage updating mechanism to encourage all the participants to actively improve hedging effectiveness. originality/value: this paper analyzes and verifies, for the first time, the role of the dynamic linkage updating mechanism in the investing behaviors of hedgers and the regulatory behaviors of future brokerage firms. the futures market experiment that was designed and used in this study is a pioneering and exploratory experiment that applies game theory and mechanism design theory to the field of behavioral finance. © 2018, emerald publishing limited."

(2) what fundamental approaches like the cultural formulation interview and the bio-psycho-socio-cultural model help providers achieve it? (3) how do we link outcomes with culturally competent and telepsychiatric competencies? rural underserved patients need culturally competent care, which requires skills by all health care team members. skill-focused training based on practical everyday practices, cases, and pedagogic methods can improve care and engage participants. telepsychiatric care is similar to in-person care, either requires integrated cultural and telepsychiatric skills. educational and administrative adjustments are needed to promote culturally competent care, particularly by telehealth. rural populations need culturally competent care and teams with telepsychiatric skill sets increase access. more quantitative and qualitative research is suggested to improve the approach and better evaluate, administer, and finance services. © 2018, springer international publishing ag, part of springer nature."

"abstract: this paper explores how financial markets can support the practical applicability of sustainability development goals (sdgs) principles and why ethics has a central role in this process. the efficient market hypothesis holds that a financial market is efficient when prices equate value. extending this assertion to sustainability, it can be said that prices should become equal to sustainable value. prices can be regarded as the addition of the present value of future expectations and the impact of short-term volatility. this property parallels the existence of two different types of shareholders: long-run shareholders, who are often involved in the management of the corporation, and short-run shareholders, who usually apply speculative strategies to the choice of their investments. the sgds' principles are logically thought for a long-run horizon. their impact on corporate value stems mainly from the changes they introduce in environmental and social risk, apart from becoming a potential source of innovation. nevertheless, their effects on the short-run perspective can be very small unless either market traders assume sustainability as a goal of their own or the sustainability effects are incorporated into prices. we hold that the second issue is safer and preferable. both involve ethics: the former would require that investors perform any trade from an ethical perspective. the latter needs that the ethical emphasis is placed on the process of price determination. the achievement of this goal demands a wide display of information on sustainability, placed together with financial information, and appropriate regulation. its analysis considers the principles of behavioral finance. © 2018 by the authors."

"purpose: the purpose of this paper is to conduct a behavioral analysis, through overconfidence, in order to understand how this cognitive bias could affect risk taking and inefficiency in islamic and conventional banks operating in the mena region. design/methodology/approach: to achieve the objective, the authors considered two overconfidence proxies, namely loan growth rate and net interest margin. using the generalized method of moments method regressions for panel data, the authors found that the two overconfidence proxies have an effect on the risk exposure and consequently on the efficiency level of islamic and conventional banks. findings: in general, overconfidence bias causes excessive risk taking and the degradation of the cost efficiency level. moreover, these effects emerge with a delay of three to four years and have implications that are not too different for both types of banks. originality/value: the main motivation underlying this research study is the relatively new field of behavioral finance way in treating the topic of overconfidence. the particularity of the overconfidence bias topic is its assumption that financial decisions can be influenced by cognitive biases, ignoring the fact of a predetermined risk-return calculation. © 2018, emerald publishing limited."
"traditional finance theories suggest that individuals make rational investment decisions after carefully considering risk and return factors to maximize their gains while limiting their losses. behavioral finance challenges the traditional financial theory and suggests that multiple biases impact individual investment decisions. these include heuristic biases such as anchoring, representativeness, gamblers fallacy and more; and regret aversion, framing and disposition effect as elaborated under prospect theory. the research paper aims to understand how these biases impact investment decision making process and what steps can be taken by individual investors to make rational decisions. analyzing how practical considerations limit individual decision making, the paper concludes that individual investors need to carefully mine data and consider external factors before undertaking investments. © iaeme publication"

"purpose: the purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of financial advice on investor trading behavior by analyzing the influence of advisor personality. design/methodology/approach: the study utilized the big five personality framework from costa and mccrae (1992) to measure personality traits of advisors and examined the data collected from 314 stock investor–advisor dyads. personality traits of advisors were measured by the neo-five factor inventory (costa and mccrae, 1989). confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to assess the fitness of the big five model. we followed two-stage least square method for estimating endogenous covariate by employing instrumental variable analysis. probit model was used to evaluate the moderating influence of advisor personality traits on the association between the usage of financial advice and trading behavior. findings: the authors found that financial advice positively impacts investors’ stock trading frequency. the authors also provide empirical evidence that financial advice is more likely to increase trading frequency when advisor personality tends to be openness, conscientiousness and agreeableness. on the other hand, information acquired from financial advisors causes fewer adjustments in investors’ portfolios when the personality of advisors is likely to be extraverted and neurotic. research limitations/implications: the theoretical model in our study seeks to explain that a psychological factor, namely, advisor personality, influences the way an investor interprets information signals from financial advice, which, in turn, influences the investor’s decision to trade in securities. practical implications: this research suggests that characteristics of advisors other than those of investors can be of relevance for policy makers in their attempts to improve their business in the financial services industry. originality/value: survey-based studies in finance are lacking. this study adds to the existing literature of behavioral finance that accounts for the observed variations in investors’ financial decision making explained by psychological factors. no previous study has been conducted so far exploring variations in the impact of financial advice on investors’ stock trading behavior by the big five advisor personality, and this paper strives to fill this research gap in chinese stock market. © 2018, emerald publishing limited."
"how the online social media, like twitter or its variant weibo, interacts with the stock market and whether it can be a convincing proxy to predict the stock market have been debated for years, especially for china. as the traditional theory in behavioral finance states, the individual emotions can influence decision-makings of investors, it is reasonable to further explore these controversial topics systematically from the perspective of online emotions, which are richly carried by massive tweets in social media. through thorough studies on over 10 million stock-relevant tweets and 3 million investors from weibo, it is revealed that inexperienced investors with high emotional volatility are more sensible to the market fluctuations than the experienced or institutional ones, and their dominant occupation also indicates that the chinese market might be more emotional as compared to its western counterparts. then both correlation analysis and causality test demonstrate that five attributes of the stock market in china can be competently predicted by various online emotions, like disgust, joy, sadness and fear. specifically, the presented prediction model significantly outperforms the baseline model, including the one taking purely financial time series as input features, on predicting five attributes of the stock market under the k-means discretization. we also employ this prediction model in the scenario of realistic online application and its performance is further testified. © 2017, springer science+business media, llc."
"internet malicious incident occur frequently in recent years, bringing huge loss in different fields such as telecommunication, finance, etc. such incidents generally entail fraudulent behaviors, which deviate from normal behavioral patterns. particularly, in telecommunication, those anomalous interactions can be manifested by the network formed through interactions between callers and callees. telecommunication network is indeed a bipartite, directed, and attributed network, and the anomalous network structure can be better captured by simultaneously considering these distinctive perspectives. to that end, in this paper, we propose a novel metric to measure the abnormality of dense subgraph structure by considering the structure, temporal changes, as well the attributes on nodes and edges. we further formulate an objective function and propose a greedy approach to discover the structure and corresponding fraudsters. the proposed metric and algorithm are experimented on a real-world telecommunication network dataset, which is shown to achieve competitive fraud detection performance than the baseline methods. © 2018 ieee."

"venture capitalists are confronted with decision-making problems under an uncertain investment circumstance, which lead them to rely heavily on intuition and psychological state to make their decisions in most cases. it has attracted more and more researches to focus on such behaviors of venture capitalists in recent years and along with the development of behavioral finance in venture capital field. through the review of framework of venture capitalists’ decision-making and the investigation of background of venture capital market in china, we find that the decision-making framework, which is based on the traditional expected utility theory with hypothesis that the investor is completely rational, is inconsistent with reality. moreover, the decision-making information is often depicted as crisp number with probability that couldn't express the uncertainty which is the fundamental nature of venture capital circumstance. therefore, a novel approach that considers both the bounded rationality of venture capitalists and the uncertain circumstance of venture capital in decision-making is urgent to select the promising enterprise in china. fortunately, prospect theory, as one of the greatest achievement in behavioral finance, thinks that venture capitalists focus on subjective probabilities instead of objective probabilities and show the behavior characterized by risk aversion over gains and risk seeking over losses, which can depict the psychological state of venture capitalists properly. furthermore, the intuitionistic fuzzy information can express essential uncertainty in venture capital circumstance accurately. therefore, we adopt intuitionistic fuzzy prospect theory that integrates both the merits of prospect theory and intuitionistic fuzzy information to aid venture capitalists to make a better decision in the real world. in this paper, the detailed steps of how to select a promising enterprise has been illustrated. then, a practical example of selecting the promising enterprise for venture capitalists in ali capital is provided to exhibit the process of application and exemplify the feasibility of this selecting approach. meanwhile, from the comparison of ranking results derived by topsis and this approach, we find that the approach proposed in this paper is superior to the topsis in selecting the promising enterprise according to the subsequent funded results of enterprises. © 2017 elsevier b.v."
"overconfidence is one of the most robust findings in the field of behavioral finance, and is associated with excessive trading and risk taking among market participants. assessment of the level of confidence of individuals in their abilities and skills is well documented. however, the literature lacks an aggregate measure of investor confidence, with this required to test its implications on a macro level. the author introduces a simple measure of aggregate investor confidence by adopting a formal model of overconfidence. the applications of the measure suggest that, in aggregate, higher trading activity occurs when investor confidence soars, particularly for smaller stocks. subsequently, the effect partially reverses, implying a correction to an initial overreaction. the newly introduced investor confidence index possesses better ability to predict trading activity than past returns, as used in prior studies. additionally, investors tend to have a higher risk appetite when confident, as shown by increased investment in small stocks with higher risk. © 2018, © 2018 the institute of behavioral finance."
"this study aims to determine the system of managing shared resources, production activities, profit sharing agreements, behavior control systems, and social changes performed by webbing bamboo craftswomen at kayubihi village of bangli regency, bali province. this research is qualitative research employing grounded research approach by applying gradual analysis using systematic approach from strauss and corbin. the research subjects were webbing bamboo craftswomen. the data collection procedures were done through observation and interview. based on the data analysis, it was revealed that the system of managing shared resources is based on some considerations on the availability of raw materials, the relationship between the coordinator with the webbing bamboo craftswomen as well as trust and solidarity. next, the production activities of making webbing bamboo are based on the considerations of cutting bamboo and making various webbing motifs. third, the profit sharing agreement is based on the number of webbing that can be done by crafters as well as the the number of various types of webbing that are handed over to the crafter’s coordinator. fourth, the behavioral control systems are based on unwritten rules, which are still obeyed by all crafters that are a norm that provides guidelines in the artisan’s life in the form of custom made by crafters in making webbing. the craftwomen have social changes experience when they do their profession, as webbing bamboo crafters is the importance of skills transfer, the existence of advocates of social life especially economic education in managing family finances and the crafter’s hope that the resulting products remain in demand by consumer for the purpose of business sustainability in the future. © iaeme publication."

"what happens when the capital asset pricing model is adjusted for the anchoring and adjustment heuristic of tversky and kahneman [1974]? the surprising finding is that adjusting the capital asset pricing model for anchoring provides a plausible unified framework for understanding almost all of the key asset pricing anomalies. the anomalies captured in the theoretical framework include the well-known size and value effects, high alpha of low beta stocks, accruals, low volatility anomaly, momentum effect, stock splits, and reverse stock splits. the market equity premium is also larger with anchoring. this suggests that the anchoring-adjusted capital asset pricing model may provide the needed unifying structure to behavioral finance. © 2018, © 2018 the institute of behavioral finance."
"this paper studies the relationship between real financial market exchange rate volatility and us cross-border equity flows. we found strong evidence that causality goes from real financial market exchange rate volatility to equity flows. according to our results, real financial market exchange rate volatility negatively influences purchases of foreign equity. this finding is in line with the portfolio optimization theory. the impact of real financial market exchange rate volatility on sales of foreign equity is also negative. this result can be explained by the theory of behavioral finance which states that investors are reluctant to realize losses of their portfolios. this is why investors decrease sales of assets when riskiness of the assets increases. the impact of real financial market exchange rate on net purchases of foreign equity is positive. it follows from these results that sales of foreign equity decrease more strongly than purchases of foreign equity when riskiness of foreign assets increases. © 2017, springer-verlag gmbh germany, part of springer nature."
"this article examines the prevalence of victimization among older chinese living in urban china and its psychological and behavioral impacts. a representative sample of 453 older adults aged 60 or above was recruited from kunming, the people’s republic of china, using multistage sampling method. participants were individually interviewed on their demographic characteristics, experience of common crime and domestic violence victimization, fear of common crime and domestic violence, mental health, and constrained behavior. results showed that 254 participants (56.1%) reported one or more types of common crime and 21 (4.6%) reported experiencing domestic violence in the past. seventeen participants (3.8%) reportedly experienced both common crime and domestic violence victimization. there was no gender difference in the overall incidence of victimization but in some subtypes. regression analyses indicated that past experience of common crime victimization was significantly associated with greater fear of common crime (β =.136, p =.004), poorer mental health (β =.136, p =.003), and more constrained behavior (β =.108, p =.025). fear of common crime predicted increased constrained behavior (β =.240, p <.001) independent of gender, age, education, household finances, living arrangement, and physical health. domestic violence victimization was not significant in predicting poor mental health and constrained behavior but was significant in predicting fear of domestic violence (β =.266, p <.001), which was related to poorer mental health (β =.102, p =.039). the study suggests the importance of taking older people’s risk and experience of victimization into consideration in gerontological research, practice, and policymaking. © 2017, © the author(s) 2017."
"disability studies were founded on a transition from a « medical model », in which disability is mostly thought based on individual deficiencies, to a « social model », in which disability is conceived as a relational reality in a given environment. this chapter proposes to question the translation of that transition in the french administration of disability through the case of autism. parents’ organizations have contributed since the end of the 1980’s to a reframing of autism, in redefining autistic disorders as being a behavioral instead of a psychological problem, and in claiming a right to an educative care as opposed to a psychiatric one. parents use the existing “disabled child education allowance” to finance alternative care arrangements that resort to private health professionals and “ordinary” schooling. this reframing of autism has generated a malaise in the administration of disability regarding the allocation of this benefit to parents of children diagnosed with autism. this malaise is structured by two key issues: how should the relevance of an alternative care arrangement be assessed? how should the notion of education be delimited? the emerging right to an educative care for children diagnosed with autism questions both the definition terms and the boundaries of the target public. this chapter first explores the ways the administration deals with these uncertainties, especially in asking for psychiatric expertise. it also shows how parents’ organizations make alliances with psychiatrists to secure the right to an educative care in an institutional setting characterized by medical assessment of deficiencies. based on an ethnographic study of the administrative assessment of disability rights for children diagnosed with autism, this analysis allows underlining the paradoxical place of psychiatry in the definition of a public eligible to a non-psychiatric care, and more generally, the limits of the actual transition from a medical to a social model of disability. © 2018, springer international publishing ag, part of springer nature."

"the authors analyze the impact of individuals' degree of extraversion and neuroticism on their decision making in an experimental asset market. to establish this link between research on experimental asset markets and social psychology the authors use a unique approach that combines a questionnaire designed to assess individuals' degree of extraversion and neuroticism and an experimental asset market to assess individual financial decision making. the dataset combines 364 undergraduate business students' questionnaire responses and their trading behavior in the asset market. the authors find that extraversion and neuroticism significantly influence individuals' behavior in the experimental asset market. specifically, more extraverted individuals pay higher prices for financial assets and they buy more financial assets when assets are overpriced than less extraverted individuals do. more neurotic individuals hold less risky assets in their financial portfolios than less neurotic individuals do. although a large part of the explanatory power appears to be driven by gender differences, the authors still find significant impact of extraversion and neuroticism after controlling for gender effects. the study findings suggest that further research on financial markets could benefit from including personality of market participants as a crucial explanatory factor. © 2018 the institute of behavioral finance."
"recent tobacco regulations proposed by the food and drug administration have raised a thorny question: how should the cost-benefit analysis accompanying such policies value foregone consumer surplus associated with regulation-induced reductions in smoking? in a model with rational and fully informed consumers, this question is straightforward. there is disagreement, however, aboutwhether consumers are rational and fully informed, and the literature offers little practical guidance about what approach the fda should use if they are not. in this paper, we outline the history of the fda’s recent attempts to regulate cigarettes and other tobacco products and how they have valued foregone consumer surplus in cost-benefit analyses.we advocate replacing the approach used in most of this literature, which first calculates health gains associated with regulation and then “offsets” them by some factor reflecting consumer surplus losses, with a more general behavioral public finance framework for welfare analysis. this framework applies standard tools of welfare analysis to consumer demand that may be “biased” (that is, not necessarily rational and fully informed) without requiring specific assumptions about the reason for the bias. this framework would require estimates of both biased and unbiased consumer demand; we sketch an agenda to help develop these in the context of smoking. the use of this framework would substantially reduce the confusion currently surrounding welfare analysis of tobacco regulation. © 2017 american society of health economists and massachusetts institute of technology."
"in this paper, we examine the role of foreign investors in the anchoring bias of stock markets. while the existing behavioral finance literature is mostly based on established capital markets like u.s. and u.k., this paper focuses on emerging economy in which foreign investors are important stockholders. using a sample of common stocks listed on the korea stock exchange between 2001 and 2014, we document the following empirical results. first, the nearness of current price to the 52-week high is positively related to the magnitude of post-earnings announcement drift (pead). this indicates that investors are hesitant to revise their beliefs upward (downward) when positive (negative) surprises arrive if the price is already near (far below) its 52-week high, on average. more important, the positive relation between the price proximity to the 52-week high and pead disappears for stocks with high level of foreign investor ownership, suggesting that anchoring effect of stocks’ 52-week high prices is mitigated by foreign investors. also, dedicated foreign institutions play an important role in mitigating the extent of pead due to anchoring bias. these findings add new evidence to the literature that sophisticated foreign investors reduce market anomaly because they are less subject to cognitive bias such as anchoring on 52-week high stock price in forming earnings expectations. © 2018 elsevier b.v."

"the copula theory allows to easily model the probability distributions of random vectors by separately estimating the marginal distributions and the dependence structure of the components represented by the copula itself. copula functions generally provide significant improvements to the financial portfolio allocation problem. however, being given the large spectrum of available copulas, the choice of the best model is rather complex. this paper investigates the copula misspecification impact on the portfolio allocation problem, which is an important risk model issue. we address this issue from the perspective of the behavioral portfolio theory through the zakamouline (quant finance 14(4):699–710, 2014) approach by considering an investor allocating his wealth between a risk-free asset and a risky asset. our main objective is to assess investors’ sensitivities to the choice of the probability of the random vector, namely both the marginal distributions and the copula function. this analysis is conducted with respect to their degrees of risk and loss aversions, for different compositions of the risky asset, and for different investment horizons. © 2016, springer science+business media new york."
"event data are collected in logistics, manufacturing, finance, health care, customer relationship management, e-learning, e-government, and many other domains. the events found in these domains typically refer to activities executed by resources at particular times and for a particular case (i.e., process instances). process mining techniques are able to exploit such data. in this article, we focus on process discovery. however, process mining also includes conformance checking, performance analysis, decision mining, organizational mining, predictions, recommendations, and so on. these techniques help to diagnose problems and improve processes. all process mining techniques involve both event data and process models. therefore, a typical first step is to automatically learn a control-flow model from the event data. this is very challenging, but in recent years, many powerful discovery techniques have been developed. it is not easy to compare these techniques since they use different representations and make different assumptions. users often need to resort to trying different algorithms in an ad-hoc manner. developers of new techniques are often trying to solve specific instances of a more general problem. therefore, we aim to unify existing approaches by focusing on log and model abstractions. these abstractions link observed and modeled behavior: concrete behaviors recorded in event logs are related to possible behaviors represented by process models. hence, such behavioral abstractions provide an “interface” between both of them. we discuss four discovery approaches involving three abstractions and different types of process models (petri nets, block-structured models, and declarative models). the goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of process discovery and show how to develop new techniques. examples illustrate the different approaches and pointers to software are given. the discussion on abstractions and process representations is also presented to reflect on the gap between process mining literature and commercial process mining tools. this facilitates users to select an appropriate process discovery technique. moreover, structuring the role of internal abstractions and representations helps broaden the view and facilitates the creation of new discovery approaches. this article is categorized under: algorithmic development > spatial and temporal data mining application areas > business and industry technologies > machine learning application areas > data mining software tools. © 2018 wiley periodicals, inc."
"behavioral finance studies reveal that investor sentiment affects investment decisions and may therefore affect stock pricing. this paper examines whether the geographic proximity of information disseminated by the 2014–2016 ebola outbreak events combined with intense media coverage affected stock prices in the u.s. we find that the ebola outbreak event effect is the strongest for the stocks of companies with exposure of their operations to the west african countries (wac) and the u.s. and for the events located in the wac and the u.s. this result suggests that the information about ebola outbreak events is more relevant for companies that are geographically closer to both the birthplace of the ebola outbreak events and the financial markets. the results also show that the effect is more pronounced for small and more volatile stocks, stocks of specific industry, and for the stocks exposed to the intense media coverage. the event effect is also followed by the elevated perceived risk; that is, the implied volatility increases after the ebola outbreak events. © 2017 elsevier inc."

"purpose: despite their crucial role in sustaining national economies, small and medium enterprises (smes) are beset by the constraint of financing at better conditions. the purpose of this paper is to compare supply chain finance (scf) solutions provided by commercial banks and financial service providers (fsps) that help smes access financing. design/methodology/approach: this study looks at multiple case studies using in-depth interviews with focal firms (lenders) to answer the research questions. in-depth interviews were conducted with three chinese fsps and three commercial banks providing working capital to the same smes. the unit of analysis is scf solutions that have made the companies competitive in the industry. findings: the case studies show that the acquisition of transaction information and business credit in scf can reduce ex ante information asymmetry. scf utilizing receivable transfers, closed-loop business, relational embeddedness, and a combination of outcome control and behavioral control can also reduce ex post information asymmetry. for these reasons, compared with commercial bank-dominated scf, scf adopted by fsps in the supply chain can better reduce information asymmetry. originality/value: this study contributes to the emerging literature exploring the impact of scf on smes accessing financing. in particular, this study provides supply chain management and operations insights on scf and their consequent influence. previous research has focused on the direct dyadic relationship between lenders and borrowers while neglecting supply chain effects. uniquely, this study explores the different ways commercial banks and fsps implement scf solutions. © 2018, emerald publishing limited."
"purpose: behavioral finance is a paradigm shift that combines psychological aspects of human behaviour with traditional finance concepts to understand investment decision making process of investors. in the course of such analysis, it brings to light some departures from rational decision making by investors which are termed as biases. in cognitively complex situations, individuals use biases to take the most optimum, but not the most rational decisions. the purpose of creating archetypes of investors is to customize investment advice based on biases exhibited by the individual investor. the benefit of archetypes is that they help in communicating a lot of information without much explanation or analysis. hence, this is a very practical tool to assist financial service providers to understand the investment decision making process and develop more effective financial products that would help investors in achieving their investment goals. design/methodology: the research was primarily descriptive in nature and quantitative in approach. survey technique through the use of a questionnaire was used to collect numerical data, which was empirically investigated via statistical computation techniques. an initial inventory of 24 items pertaining to 21 biases was assessed for validity, was subjected to pilot tests, and subsequently to various rounds of modification. the final data were collected from 389 respondents using a questionnaire that captured the biases. the archetypes were created using principal component analysis. findings: the research came up with archetypes of investors based on heuristics and biases they exhibited. the archetypes were thus named by us as: the stereotypical investor, the nervous investor, the imitator, the naïve investor, the cautious investor, and the passive investor. practical implications: the paper provided a very practical tool not only to investors to understand their own biases, but also to portfolio managers about how investors differ behaviourally. this will give investors a better chance to achieve desired outcomes in the stock market. this will not only result in improving the quality of their advice, but also help them in structuring better asset allocations customised to suit the investor. © 2018 indian joural of finance."

"the objective of the paper is to introduce a conceptual framework for the study of learning behavior of an individual investor in the context of stock trading. it is developed based on the review of behavioral finance literature, and insights from cognitive, behavioral and social learning theories and related empirical evidence. the framework recognizes the investor as an entity that learns consciously and/or unconsciously for continually updating its perspectives underlying stock trading. the intentional or consciousness form of learning occurs as individual learning through reflection of past trading experiences whereas the learning happens unconsciously as social learning through inquiry and imitating the others’ behaviors. these learning processes are expected to be affected by interaction of various structures and processes, both internal and external to the investor, such as cognitive, affective, social and behavioral ones. accordingly, the framework suggests five hypotheses to examine the determinants of these learning behaviors and to assess whether the investors learn over passage of time through the effects of these structures and processes. it promotes primary data-based behavioral finance empirical studies to track dynamics involved in learning, which could provide new insights on such behavior predicted by the adaptive market hypothesis. © 2018, © 2018 the author(s). this open access article is distributed under a creative commons attribution (cc-by) 4.0 license."
"we examine the notion that financial products which cater to investors’ behavioral biases can yield high trading activity and thus be profitable for issuers. our setting considers options with a callback feature, namely, callable bull/bear contracts (cbbcs). such contracts have high skewness when close to callback and thus appeal to cumulative prospect theory preferences. cbbcs with high skewness earn negative average returns, and issuers’ gross profits vary positively with cbbc skewness. over the 2009–2014 period, issuers earn gross profits of about $1.67 billion by trading cbbcs on the hang seng index. these findings highlight the role of behavioral finance in financial innovation. © 2018 elsevier b.v."
"in 2017, the potential duration of the finnish earnings-related unemployment benefit was cut from 500 to 400 days (or 400 to 300 working days). we apply a microsimulation method to calculate both static and behavioral ex-ante effects of the reform on employment, public finances and income inequality. relying on previous empirical literature, we employ three benefit elasticity levels. individual heterogeneity is added by weighting the elasticities with estimated employment probabilities. according to the static scenario, the reform increases income inequality, albeit marginally. accounting for the behavioral response mitigates the effect on inequality and more than doubles the effect on public finances. © 2018 international microsimulation association."
"the extant literature on behavioral corporate finance has explored the effects of overconfidence on investment–cash flow sensitivity (ics) to explain overinvestment, yet it has overlooked the asymmetric behavior of investments in relation to changes in cash flow levels. this study examines whether investments behave asymmetrically responding to changes in cash flows and, if so, how managerial overconfidence affects asymmetric ics. using a sample of kospi and kosdaq firms in korea, we find the incidence of downwardly sticky ics in unconstrained firms. we then find that overconfident managers encourage ics to be stickier than their rational peers do in unconstrained firms. finally, we find that managerial overconfidence intensified by self-attribution bias induces ics to get even stickier, suggesting more explicit evidence of corporate investment distortions. the results of alternative tests using the asymmetric models of homburg and nasev (2008) are qualitatively consistent with prior results. overall, our findings imply a higher incidence of excessive investment commitments driven by overconfident managers. copyright © taylor & francis group, llc."
"this work aims to develop interventions to reduce automobile idling, where a driver runs the engine unnecessarily while not moving. idling is a serious problem that wastes fuel, pollutes the air, and releases greenhouse gas emissions. drivers idle for different reasons, including misconceptions about the time needed to warm up their engines and how much additional fuel is expended by turning the engine off and back on. information-based interventions, i.e., messages to address idling, may therefore work more effectively to change behavior by correcting such misconceptions than for other types of pro-environmental behaviors where corresponding misconceptions may not exist. this work incorporates regulatory focus theory, a social-psychological framework which differentiates between promotion- and prevention-focused individuals. furthermore, messages are framed with respect to idling-relevant concerns that participants identify - finance, health, or the environment. participants were asked to express behavioral intention and engagement in response to messages tailored for their regulatory focus and domain of concern. results revealed that 1) participants prioritized finance and health much more often than the environment; 2) most participant categories responded well to their targeted messages; 3) promotion/finance participants seemed especially challenging to motivate, but modifications to their targeted messages led to improved results. copyright © 2018 asme"
"the author explores the effect of the availability heuristic on large daily stock price changes and on subsequent stock returns. he hypothesizes that if a major positive (negative) stock price move takes place on a day when the stock market index rises (falls), then its magnitude may be amplified by the availability of positive (negative) investment outcomes. in both cases, the availability heuristic may cause price overreaction to the initial company-specific shock, resulting in subsequent price reversal. in line with the hypothesis, the author documents that both positive and negative large price moves accompanied by the same-sign contemporaneous daily market returns are followed by significant reversals on the next 2 trading days and over 5- and 20-day intervals following the event, the magnitude of the reversals increasing over longer postevent windows, while large stock price changes taking place on the days when the market index moves in the opposite direction are followed by nonsignificant price drifts. the results remain robust after accounting for additional company (size, beta, historical volatility) and event-specific (stock's return and trading volume on the event day) factors, and are stronger for small and volatile stocks. © 2018 the institute of behavioral finance."

"the paper investigates the extent to which emotional intelligence has an impact on decision making mainly with regard to financial decisions and their outcomes. its relevance lies in the fact that despite the remarkable evolution of the literature related to the determinants of financial choices, it is not comprehensively apprehended what really guides managers’ decisions. the study offers a wide support for behavioral finance and demonstrates a paradigmatic shift in exploring financial decisions. the paradigmatic evolution of financial theory has yield to an “invisible” part of the reality which in turn generates some “hidden” costs. at this level, the behavioral financial paradigm becomes relevant to shed some light on the real dynamic of financial decisions. an empirical study based on a survey on 50 tunisian firms confirms the “partial” influence of emotional intelligence on financial decisions and the detection of a potential to be upgraded. results show that managers who rely on their emotional intelligence can successfully, on one hand, improve firm's funding opportunities, and on the other hand avoid overreaching the debt target ratio in such a way to maintain the financial stability of their firms. the study offers insights at two levels: first, educators are urged to integrate emotional intelligence competencies in their teaching objectives. second, human resource management professionals are invited to reconsider hiring techniques and training methods favorably to detect and develop an emotional intelligence capital. © 2017 elsevier b.v."
"this book provides an alternative view of the workings of foreign exchange markets. the authors' modeling approach is based on the idea that agents use simple forecasting rules and switch to those rules that have been shown to be the most profitable in the past. this selection mechanism is based on trial and error and is probably the best possible strategy in an uncertain world, the authors contend. it creates a rich dynamic in the foreign exchange markets and can generate bubbles and crashes. sensitivity to initial conditions is a pervasive force in de grauwe and grimaldi's model. it explains why large exchange-rate changes and volatility clustering occur. it also has important implications for understanding how the news affects the exchange rate. de grauwe and grimaldi conclude that news in fundamentals has an unpredictable effect on the exchange rate. sometimes, they maintain, it alters the exchange rate considerably; at other times it has no effectwhatsoever. the authors also use their model to analyze the effects of official interventions in the foreign exchange market. they show that simple intervention rules of the ""leaning-against-the-wind"" variety can be effective in eliminating bubbles and crashes in the exchange rate. they further demonstrate how, quite paradoxically, by intervening in the foreign exchange market the central bank makes the market look more efficient. clear and comprehensive, the exchange rate in a behavioral finance framework is a must-have for analysts in foreign exchange markets as well as students of international finance and economics. © 2006 by princeton university press."
"we demonstrate that investor satisfaction and investment behavior are influenced substantially by the price path by which the final investor return is achieved. in a series of experiments, we analyze various different price paths. investors are most satisfied if their assets first fall in value and then recover, and they are least satisfied with the opposite pattern, independent of whether the final return is positive or negative. price paths systematically influence risk preferences, return beliefs, and ultimately trading decisions. our results enable a much more holistic perspective on a wide range of topics in finance, such as the disposition effect, risk-taking behavior after previous gains and losses, and behavioral asset pricing. © 2017 elsevier b.v."
"rational expectations and behavioral-finance models are widely interpreted as representing two distinct conceptions of decision-making: rational and irrational, respectively. using survey data, this paper presents econometric evidence that both fundamental factors and extrapolation drive participants’ expectations of stock returns, but that they do so in ways that vary over time. although both the reh and behavioral-finance approaches offer relevant insights for understanding participants’ expectations, neither of these distinct model classes is consistent with time-series data. the paper's findings also suggest that structural change gives rise to ambiguity about the correct quantitative model driving outcomes. this ambiguity, faced by economists and market participants alike, is the key to according both fundamental and behavioral factors a role in rational forecasting. © 2018 elsevier b.v."
"the authors investigate the global and extreme dependence structure between investor sentiment and stock returns in 7 european stock markets (belgium, france, germany, greece, the netherlands, portugal, and the uk), over the period 1985–2015. global dependence refers to the correlation of changes in sentiment and stock returns over the whole range of these 2 variables, and extreme dependence refers to the local correlation of high (i.e. asymptotic) changes in sentiment and high stock returns. using copula models and a bootstrap procedure, 6 statistical tests are performed for this purpose. among the results of the tests, the authors highlight those that provide evidence of contemporaneous lower extreme dependence and contemporaneous upper extreme independence between sentiment and returns. as policy implications, these results suggest that financial stability can be promoted if regulators consider the impact of their decisions on investor sentiment. also, the results seem to support the arguments in favor of short selling ban during turmoil periods. finally, overall, the results are relevant for both investors and regulators and reinforce the importance of considering investor sentiment to better understand the behavior of financial markets. © 2018 the institute of behavioral finance."
"this article explores the extent that the long-run returns following initial public offerings (ipos) can explain the asserted decrease in ipos in canada. the causes of such a decrease remain controversial, in part because of our limited knowledge of this market. we first describe in detail the evolution of canadian ipos on the senior and the venture stock exchanges over three decades (1986–2016). this evolution differs considerably between natural resource and non-natural resource firms. second, using other junior markets as a benchmark, we show that the canadian ipo market is very particular, mainly because it lists very small firms at an early development stage. third, using 2,145 canadian ipos, we provide evidence that these ipos generate three-year negative average abnormal returns, and more than 70 percent report negative abnormal returns. large issuers reporting profits constitute the only subsample that provides fair returns, but they account for less than 5 percent of ipos. such a market probably survived for many decades because of investors' preference for skewness and the characteristics of the returns' distribution. we observe a high level of skewness of abnormal returns, consistent with the behavioral finance proposition that investors are often unduly optimistic when valuing lottery stocks. © caaa/acpc"
"the purpose of this study was to identify tangible and intangible gains resulting from advertising in restaurant businesses from both the marketing and finance/accounting perspectives. specifically, this study examined both behavioral and intermediate effects of advertising on consumer behavior and firm performance. annual sales, profit, tobin’s q, and advertising expenditure of 119 restaurant firms from 1991 to 2012 were used for data analysis. the findings revealed that advertising led to an immediate increase in consumer demand, but failed to improve profit. the effect of advertising on sales and profit through brand equity was found to be insignificant. this study suggests a new angle on the use of advertising and brand strategies in the restaurant industry and discusses potential directions for future research. © 2015, © the author(s) 2015."
"behavioral finance theories posit that behavioral biases are more pronounced when there is higher information uncertainty about fundamentals. this paper examines the relation between the disposition effect, the tendency to ride losses and realize gains, and dispersion in financial analysts’ earnings forecasts for a sample of large u.s. discount brokerage accounts from january 1991 to december 1996. i find that the disposition effect is exacerbated in stocks with higher analyst forecast dispersion. in particular, the disposition effect is 10% in stocks in the highest forecast dispersion quintile and not significant in the lowest forecast dispersion quintile. the driving factor behind these findings is investors’ higher propensity to realize gains when facing higher information uncertainty. the results are robust to controlling for firm size, analyst coverage, idiosyncratic volatility, turnover, and past market-adjusted returns. the results provide supportive evidence for a behavioral bias explanation of the disposition effect consistent with mean-reversion beliefs for winners and loss actualization avoidance for losers. © 2017, springer science+business media, llc."

"quasi-equilibrium models for aggregate or emergent variables over long periods of time are widely used throughout finance and economics. the validity of such models depends crucially upon assuming that the system participants act both independently and without memory. however important real-world effects such as herding, imitation, perverse incentives, and many of the key findings of behavioral economics violate one or both of these key assumptions. we present a very simple, yet realistic, agent-based modeling framework that is capable of simultaneously incorporating many of these effects. in this paper we use such a model in the context of a financial market to demonstrate that herding can cause a transition to multi-year boom-and-bust dynamics at levels far below a plausible estimate of the herding strength in actual financial markets. in other words, the stability of the standard (brownian motion) equilibrium solution badly fails a “stress test” in the presence of a realistic weakening of the underlying modeling assumptions. the model contains a small number of fundamental parameters that can be easily estimated and require no fine-tuning. it also gives rise to a novel stochastic particle system with switching and re-injection that is of independent mathematical interest and may also be applicable to other areas of social dynamics. © springer nature switzerland ag 2018."
"agricultural research and development (r&d) investment has become an increasingly important policy issue as food prices increased and food security problems emerged over the last decade. an important source of agricultural r&d funding is the producer check-off, which is increasingly being used to fund applied agricultural research. existing studies of producer-funded agricultural r&d indicate there are high private rates of return to agricultural r&d investment by farmers, and thus farmers are underinvesting in r&d. since a farmer's time horizon is typically less than the period of time over which the benefits of agricultural r&d take place, the horizon problem has been identified as a possible factor in this underinvestment. this paper shows that the horizon problem is unlikely to be the only cause of the underinvestment when the internal rate of return is large. instead, shortened producer horizons only emerge as the main source of underinvestment when the internal rate of return is low. as a result, other factors, including behavioral determinants, need to be looked at as contributors to the underfunding of agricultural r&d. les investissements en recherche et développement agricoles sont devenus un important enjeu politique étant donné l'augmentation des prix des aliments et les problèmes de sécurité alimentaire de la dernière décennie. une importante source de financement pour la recherche et le développement dans le domaine agricole sont les programmes de contribution des producteurs, ces derniers étant de plus en plus sollicités pour financer la recherche agricole appliquée. certaines études portant sur la recherche et le développement agricoles financés par les producteurs indiquent un haut taux de rendement privé des investissements en recherche et développement agricoles par les producteurs. ces derniers y investissent donc moins. puisque l'échéancier de l'agriculteur est typiquement moins long que celui pendant lequel les avantages liés à la recherche et au développement dans le domaine agricole s'échelonnent, le problème de l'horizon a été identifié comme facteur potentiel au sous-investissement. il est probable, selon cet article, que le problème de l'horizon ne soit pas la seule cause du sous-investissement lorsque le taux interne de rendement s'avère grand. plutôt, les échéanciers réduits des agriculteurs apparaissent seulement comme les sources principales de sous-investissement lorsque le taux de rendement interne est bas. il en résulte que d'autres facteurs, incluant les déterminants comportementaux, doivent être examinés à titre de contributeurs au sous-investissement de la recherche et du développement en agriculture. © 2017 canadian agricultural economics society"

"governments can contribute more effectively and efficiently to societal progress. the traditional government machinery is however inadequate, underfunded, and wrongly funded, and still overly focused on economic output rather than societal outcomes. new approaches need to deal better with multidimensional problems, some massive (such as migration), and better integrate behavioral insights and big data. this chapter highlights: (1) outcome-conditional taxes and transfers (such as a sugar tax aimed at obesity, and cash for school attendance family transfers); (2) corrective rather than just preventive regulation (as exemplified by germany’s paternal leave policy which aims to correct demographic decline); (3) nudge policies (such as opt-out rather than opt-in voluntary pension savings); (4) innovative financing (such as government matching of foreign remittance by expats to finance infrastructure inmexico); and (5) greater use of big data to compare interventions and outcomes (as attempted by the us department of education). © oxford university press 2018."
"in academic research in finance we find two approaches to risk, the “traditional” approach using historical relative frequency distributions and the emerging “behavioral” approach that concerns the findings from psychological experiments. finance practitioners understand that risk ought to be taken into account when counseling investors for example, but have no idea how to do it. neither of the academic approaches provides any guidance for them on how to assess individual attitudes towards risk or how to take these attitudes into account in making specific investment decisions. by deconstructing a survey given by a small investor advisor to married couples and administering it to a convenient sample of students, we show that in an apparent effort to appear sophisticated and scientific, practitioners address risk using a distorted version of “traditional” risk that ignores non-monetary considerations in evaluating outcomes and that ignores the importance of imagery in the assessment of risk. and there is no indication that “behavioral” risk has yet made any inroads into the popular consciousness. © george m. frankfurter and elton g. mcgoun 2002."
"this paper investigates how china appeals to other countries by utilizing soft power in ensuring their participation in the belt and road initiative (bri), which seeks to revive ancient silk road through infrastructure, trade, finance and other linkages. by employing a behavioral and contextualized explanation for soft power, this investigation reveals that chinese state actively pursues a soft power-oriented economic diplomacy for bri and relies on hard power resources for its effectiveness. furthermore, china takes advantage of the power vacuum in the global economy and embraces a liberal economic vision for the international system in its diplomatic activities emphasizing the importance of globalization, free trade, infrastructure investment, and win-win cooperation in achieving high levels of economic development. while china frames bri mainly in terms of economic development purposes, china’s soft power appeal to other countries is likely to have important political and security implications for the international system. © 2018, forsnet. all rights reserved."
"mergers and acquisitions (m&a) are important to companies as it allows them to acquire capabilities that they cannot create internally and to grow quickly. m&a transaction pricing relates to the pricing of these m&a deals and this article analyzes if behavioral finance factors like risk aversion, optimism, and loss aversion have an impact on this pricing. prospect theory and cumulative prospect theory are applied to an agent-based model to solve this problem. results of this article show that m&a transaction price does respond to a change in risk aversion and optimism traits of the acquirer and target companies respectively, as well as, loss aversion and certainty (probability of gains and losses). when, the acquirer is risk taking and target company is optimistic, the m&a transaction price increases. however, with increasing certainty of gains and reducing loss aversion (increasing loss aversion co-efficient; as gains are perceived to have the same weight as losses), the m&a transaction price seems to reduce. these results are compared with the recent mergers of verizon and aol as well as verizon and yahoo, to understand if these results would occur in practice. analyzing these mergers, it seems that the outcomes from this model does provide insight on the pricing of these m&a transactions. this article also analyzes how these behaviors would impact the pricing when three different acquirers are trying to take over a target company. results show that loss aversion has a significant effect on this pricing with risk aversion and optimism also having some minor impact. but, the existence of multiple acquirers does positively increase the m&a transaction price. © 2018 john wiley & sons, ltd."
"purpose: the purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of the target and bidder reference points on the method of payment in mergers. when considering initial and final results for target and bidder, the target appears to have more negotiating power than the bidder in achieving the financial mix preference that was initially articulated. design/methodology/approach: the authors examine the impact of target and bidder reference points on the consideration sought by the target and the consideration offered by the bidder. the authors test whether the target reference points has an impact on the final method of payment agreed upon by the target and the bidder. findings: the authors find that targets with a longer distance to their respective target reference points prefer to receive cash financing in the consideration sought, while bidders with a longer distance to their respective reference points prefer stock financing in consideration offered. the authors also find evidence that target’s longer distance to its reference point is associated with the use of cash over stock, while the bidder reference point has no impact on the final method of payment used in the merger. practical implications: these insights may be used by the management to formulate the optimal mix of financing in m&a transactions. originality/value: this is an original paper exploring the effect of behavioral finance on corporate decision making. © 2018, emerald publishing limited."
"purpose: this study aims to examine the roles of individual factors on risky investment intention as an indicator of risky financial behavior. design/methodology/approach: the data were collected from a survey instrument and composed of 496 individuals’ responses. the authors exploited structural equation modelling and multigroup structural equation modelling for direct and indirect effects, respectively. findings: results indicate that emotional intelligence and locus of control have a positive impact on financial risk-taking, while risk aversion in general has the negative one. although financial literacy does not have a direct effect on risky financial behavior, it has important role as a moderator variable, interacting with external locus of control. originality/value: the authors expect this study to contribute into behavioral finance literature in two ways. first, they investigate joint and relative effects of four major factors (i.e. emotional intelligence, locus of control, risk aversion in general and financial literacy) identified in the literature on financial risk-taking of individual investors. each belongs to a different venue in an individual’s psyche and therefore is expected to influence financial risk-taking through different mechanisms. however, the research arguing their roles on the financial risky behavior directly is very limited. investigating their individual effects is likely to provide unique insights into our understanding of risky financial behavior. second, the authors also posit and manifest that the effects of the first three of the aforementioned factors on risk-taking intentions are moderated by financial literacy. this finding is likely to provide rather valuable insights pertaining to the emergence of risk-taking behaviors and may shed light on the root reasons behind equivocal findings in previous research regarding the effect of each factor. © 2017, © emerald publishing limited."
"one of the most significant empirical findings of the behavioral finance literature is that investor sentiment affects asset prices. baker and wurgler (2006) finds that shares of certain firms—those that are difficult to value—are more affected by shifts in investor sentiment. we examine whether the accounting information of firms that are inherently difficult to value can mitigate sentiment-related mispricing. our findings indicate that sentiment-related mispricing is in fact diminished in the subset of firms with high-quality accounting information. to better understand how accounting information mitigates stock market mispricing, we examine whether sentiment affects the choices made by sell-side stock analysts. when sentiment is high, analysts issue more favorable recommendations for firms that are more difficult to value, even though these firms appear to be overpriced and exhibit negative subsequent abnormal stock returns. however, this behavior is concentrated in the subset of difficult-to-value firms with low-quality accounting information. ©2017 b. cornell, w. r. landsman and s. r. stubben."

"the purpose of this paper is to show that the discourse about market efficiency and what is called “behavioral finance” is somewhat superficial. beneath the surface of quasi-scientific debate, there are issues that go to the core of what knowledge is and how it is to be acquired in financial economics. the concern in this paper is with ontology (what is to be known) and epistemology (how it is to be known), and how conversations about both in financial economics are conducted. we show that the arguments against the empirical validity of studies at variance with the hypothesis of efficient markets cut both ways. we also show that the disputation of behavioral finance lacks the rigor commonly demanded by all schools of philosophy of science then, not a formal debate, but a two-and-a-half-hour battle with gene fama. his closing comment to me after dinner that evening was “you have pushed me an epsilon toward the abyss”, driving home that night, in a really hard rain, i had a long time to ponder that statement. why is it an abyss? and why only an epsilon? i concluded that it is only an epsilon because they are afraid of the abyss. and what is in the abyss? the abyss is the realization that we have crossed the line where we can no longer explain most of the market’s behavior on the basis of rational economic paradigms.-robert haugen in “post modern finance” (the international review o f financial analysis. 1998, 6: p. 159). © george m. frankfurter and elton g. mcgoun 2002."

"human nature has no role to play in how subatomic particles interact with one another. our propensities related to fear, euphoria, herding, and culture, however, virtually define finance. alan greenspan the map and the territory: risk, human nature, and the future of forecasting2013b, p. 6. the 2007–2008 financial crisis and its aftermath signified “an existential crisis” for economic forecasting. this is the judgment of alan greenspan, the former chief of the u.s. federal reserve system, in his book the map and the territory (2013b). before the crisis, greenspan (2007) viewed animal spirits as “random irrationalities” not readily integrated into economic models. in contrast, a key theme of his latest work is predictable error and behavioral economics grounded in psychology. about the integration of irrationality into economic theory, greenspan does not worry too much. “from the perspective of a forecaster, the issue is … not whether behavior is rational but whether it is sufficiently repetitive and systematic to be numerically measured and predicted” (greenspan, 2013a, p. 14). even so, much of modern financial economics continues to be based on the concept of rational expectations. the term stands for mathematical expectation and is devoid of any connection to psychology. a great deal of modern-day research in psychology, however, originates in thinking that first arose in gestalt psychology, an approach in which the concept of subjective expectation is key. prognostications of business and market developments, and the risks and returns associated with particular assets and asset classes, are formed on the basis of public and private data gathered from personal experience, newspapers, social networks, and so on. individuals respond to information in distinctive, often systematic, ways. for some, their forecasts amount to firm convictions and strong hopes or fears. for others, expectations are mere conjectures, colored by mood and made with little confidence. in this chapter, we discuss how individual investors, as well as experts, use expectations. we propose a simple model of expectation formation; and we highlight other factors that influence financial decision-making processes and outcomes. many of the studies that we review focus specifically on stock market forecasts, often for u.s. markets. the research fits into a broader program that explores how human psychology drives the economy (selten, 1998; akerlof and shiller, 2009). © cambridge university press 2008, 2018."
"in traditional finance theories and in the efficient market hypothesis, human beings are regarded as rational entities. it has been accepted that people exhibit rational behavior in investment decisions. however, various anomalies have been observed as a result of the inability of these theories to explain the change in the markets. these anomalies have led to criticism of traditional finance theories and have been regarded as the beginning of behavioral finance. behavioral finance theories and models argue that the definition of stock prices is influenced by psychological, cognitive and emotional factors of investors. the presence of investors, who do not act rationally on the stock market, and the fact that psychological and emotional factors are effective in the decision-making process distract the stock market from being effective. determining the investor behaviors that cause the anomalies detected in the stock market and putting out the possible reasons is important in terms of estimating the share price. in this study, information was given on traditional finance theories that accept individuals as rational. behavioral finance models and theories were examined to investigate irrational behavior. in addition, anomalies resulting from irrational behavior of investors and investor behavior were examined, and also the relationship between investor behaviors and anomalies was examined. © springer international publishing ag, part of springer nature 2018."
"the present paper is pursuing a new direction in the analysis of behavioral finance based on examining whether future performance of the firm is related to overconfidence displayed by the chief executive officer (ceo). we suggest two channels for this relationship, real earnings management (rem) and the mandatory ifrs adoption. first, examining the impact of ifrs adoption on firms’ future performance, we find that overconfident ceos who do not adopt ifrs exhibit poorer future performance. other interactions related to overconfidence and ifrs are not significant. second, examining the relationship between overconfidence and ifrs adoption on rem, we find that overconfident ceos indulge in higher rem than non-overconfident ceos. further, overconfident ceos who adopt ifrs display greater rem than do those who not adopt ifrs. therefore, we prove that the indirect effect of ceo overconfidence on the subsequent firm performance through rem is contingent on the mandatory ifrs adoption. © 2017 elsevier b.v."

"in the natural sciences “anomalies” contribute significantly to the development of new and ultimately more successful theories. the role of anomalies in financial economics, however, has been quite different. although at the beginning the word was used to show deviations from the efficient markets hypothesis/capital asset pricing model paradigm, lately it has been applied to a new literature that is also more accurately called behavioral finance. this paper argues that this misuse and misapplication of the word “anomaly” is not a simple coincidence. it is rather a sophisticated and accordant effort to imply that although there are some unresolved deviations from the norm, the reigning paradigm is irreplaceable, and its validity needs no empirical proof. in fact, an alternative paradigm such as behavioral finance is not only insignificant but also unnecessary and even impossible. © george m. frankfurter and elton g. mcgoun 2002."
"purpose formulating approaches to management of changes in the systems of various types. discussion functional system management is very complex. two groups of functions can be distinguished in it. from the point of view of realization of the managerial cycle, it is necessary to distinguish planning, organization, control, and regulation – though, there are other points of view. from the positions of management of functional sub-systems, the main components are the following: management of company, personnel, marketing, finance, and investments. one of the main rules of conduct of changes in organizations is that they are manufactured when organizations need new competences. new competences require new values, and managers of the organization (and any other system) have to ensure development of the corresponding processes and create a new organizational environment in which the necessary competences can be developed. results the main types of technologies of organizational changes management include the following: change of goals; change of results; management on the basis of needs and interests; management by constant verifications and orders; management on the basis of “artificial intellect”. the most popular mechanisms of management of organizational changes are the following: organizational design; functional and cost analysis; restructuring; behavioral transformations; reengineering; benchmarking; strategic approach; foresight. © 2018, springer international publishing ag."

"purpose: a salesman calls up to offer you a “much” better phone plan. before you know, you have changed to this new plan, which not only exceeds your needs, but also “procures” a six-month free subscription to an online music service. you needed neither and pay more: you have just been “phished” as akerlof and shiller would say in their recent book phishing for phools. furthermore, their phishing equilibrium dictates that if your company does not phish others will, so you phish to survive. the purpose of this paper is to present a formal analysis of phishing and phishing equilibria with surprising potential benefits to consumers rather than scamsters. design/methodology/approach: the paper provides a conceptual/formal (game theoretical) analysis of phishing in markets. findings: being an honest trader may actually, under certain circumstances, be an advantage in a market contrary to akerlof and shiller’s thesis phishing for phools. research limitations/implications: phishing for phools may have its limitations when viewed from an evolutionary game-theoretical perspective which has positive implications for behavioral finance and significance of a phishing equilibrium in markets populated by honest as well as dishonest traders. practical implications: the paper shows that phishing for phools may not always be a winning strategy contrary to many current business schemes from phone plans to selling pharmaceutical products. social implications: the paper reveals important differences between honesty, dishonesty, and trust between traders in a market. originality/value: this paper provides, to the authors’ knowledge, the first in-depth formal and conceptual analyses of phishing and phishing equilibria. © 2018, emerald publishing limited."
"recently, the field of artificial intelligence has made significant advances in building deep models of complex tasks. one area, however, that seems to have lagged behind is the domain of ""common sense reasoning."" much common sense reasoning research has defined the term in a way that requires deep models of everyday phenomena, making progress difficult. common sense reasoning does not in itself need to be a deep process. it can be limited to a single task-integrating the knowledge provided by other models and information sources, focusing only on the dominant conditions identified by each model. to remedy these shortcomings, we propose an approach based on an architecture that we refer to as cs+cm, for ""common sense plus constituent models"". in a cs+cm architecture, the common sense (cs) layer plays an integration role that only requires limited inferential capabilities. in addition, we propose concrete limits to representational and inferential capabilities, and identify the structural requirements for deeper models to support integration at the common sense layer. we illustrate this approach with examples in diverse areas of capital investment, team selection, and behavioral finance. © 2017 ieee."
"in this paper we compare and contrast modern finance (the de facto dominant paradigm of financial economics) with what is usually called “behavioral finance” and occasionally called “the anomalies literature”. those faithful to the dominant paradigm have in fact marginalized behavioral finance by making it the “anomalies literature”. but even the supposed proponents of behavioral finance are marginalizing themselves by clinging to the underlying tenets, forms, and methods of the dominant paradigm. they have allowed it to set the terms of the debate and made it the benchmark against which all finance is not only judged, but also labeled “finance”. but finance research itself is subject to the same “mistakes” that behavioral finance attributes to practitioners, and it is these same “mistakes”, perhaps more than the fierce attacks by the supporters of the ruling doctrine, that are preventing behavioral finance from emerging as a new paradigm. in effect, the failure of behavioral finance is proof of its veracity and legitimacy. © george m. frankfurter and elton g. mcgoun 2002."

"purpose: the purpose of this paper is to study and describe several biases in investment decision-making through the review of research articles in the area of behavioral finance. it also includes some of the analytical and foundational work and how this has progressed over the years to make behavioral finance an established and specific area of study. the study includes behavioral patterns of individual investors, institutional investors and financial advisors. design/methodology/approach: the research papers are analyzed on the basis of searching the keywords related to behavioral finance on various published journals, conference proceedings, working papers and some other published books. these papers are collected over a period of year’s right from the time when the most introductory paper was published (1979) that contributed this area a basic foundation till the most recent papers (2016). these articles are segregated into biases wise, year-wise, country-wise and author wise. all research tools that have been used by authors related to primary and secondary data have also been included into our table. findings: a new era of understanding of human emotions, behavior and sentiments has been started which was earlier dominated by the study of financial markets. moreover, this area is not only attracting the, attention of academicians but also of the various corporates, financial intermediaries and entrepreneurs thus adding to its importance. the study is more inclined toward the study of individual and institutional investors and financial advisors’ investors but the behavior of intermediaries through which some of them invest should be focused upon, narrowing down population into various variables, targeting the expanding economies to reap some unexplained theories. this study has identified 17 different types of biases and also summarized in the form of tables. research limitations/implications: the study is based on some of the most recent findings to have a quick overview of the latest work carried out in this area. so far very few extensive review papers have been published to highlight the research work in the area of behavioral finance. this study will be helpful for new researches in this field and to identify the areas where possible work can be done. practical implications: practical implication of the research is that companies, policymakers and issuers of securities can watch out of investors’ interest before issuing securities into the market. social implications: under the social implication, investors can recognize several behavioral biases, take sound investment decisions and can also minimize their risk. originality/value: the essence of this paper is the identification of 17 types of biases and the literature related to them. the study is based on both, the literature on investment decisions and the biases in investment decision-making. such study is less prevalent in the developing country like india. this paper does not only focus on the basic principles of behavioral finance but also explain some emerging concepts and theories of behavioral finance. thus, the paper generates interest in the readers to find the solutions to minimize the effect of biases in decision-making. © 2018, emerald publishing limited."

"intelligence, capability to understand and ability to achieve goals-the unique characteristics of human-beings have made them greedy and make money through irrationality. speculation and resorting to manipulation for pecuniary gains is not uncommon. irrational exuberance of investors escalates asset values unduly on the back of financial irrationality. but for markets to be efficient, investors need not be rational. efficient market hypothesis which considered competition will cause full effects of new information on intrinsic values on the average to be reflected ""instantaneously"" in actual prices did not last long. not taking the human behaviour into account in the investment process, the axiom of efficient market hypothesis that it is not possible to earn excess profits (more than the market) because the available information gets factored in instantaneously fell flat. the intersection of human behaviour and the investment decisions has since evolved as ‘behavioural finance.’ contemporary research demonstrates that investment decision making process is more human than analytical. human-beings resort to irrational behaviour owing to behavioural biases. key drivers of property investment decision and behavioural biases are unique feature of this paper. the present topic provides a comprehensive view of behavioral biases. the present study mainly focused on dependency of purchase decisions of residential property buyers on heuristic driven biases and prospect theory based behavioral biases. this study enriches the understanding of the role that behavioral factors play in residential property market, with specific reference to emerging capital markets. the results showed that representativeness bias and herding bias are influencing more on the decisions of residential property buyers. © 2018, institute of advanced scientific research, inc. all rights reserved."
"throughout its history, finance theory has made certain simplifying assumptions regarding human behavior and concerned itself with whether the implications of these assumptions were true and not with whether the assumptions themselves were. recently, however, more interest has been shown in experimental investigation of these assumptions, and the resultant behavioral finance has been presented as a significant departure from the current research paradigm. recent research in cognitive science, however, is finding that the mind can and does work differently than traditional finance assumes, and the differences between the behavioral assumptions of traditional finance and the supposedly more realistic ones of today’s behavioral finance are at best superficial. knowledge and knowing are likely to be profoundly different from the forms in which we have incorporated them in our extant models, both traditional and behavioral, and they differ in ways similar to those which, for example, have differentiated corporations from corporate images in marketing. to truly understand what is going on we must go beyond behavioral finance to address these differences. © george m. frankfurter and elton g. mcgoun 2002."

"predominant models of financial regulation based on representative agents - in both the public interest and public choice traditions - assume that competitive pressures in financial markets undermine prudential behavior by firms in the absence of regulation. one empirical expectation of these models is behavioral: firms should adjust their risk-taking behaviors in response to the regulatory environment they face but should not over-comply with regulations. that is, the central tendency of bank behaviors should hew closely to regulatory minima and the variance should be small. i first demonstrate that this expectation is not borne out by the empirical record and then advance a theoretical argument that does not rely on a representative agent model. i argue that firms face a range of incentives from markets and governments that condition their risk-taking behaviors, and firms choose a preferred habitat within a market structure. some of these incentives are towards greater risk-taking, while others are in the direction of greater prudence. this framework provides opportunities for examining financial market actors in a realistic context, and offers ways to unify micro-level and structural analyses of the political economy of global finance. copyright © v.k. aggarwal 2017 and published under exclusive license to cambridge university press."

"background and purpose: in recent years classic financial market theory based on decision makers' rationality has been challenged by repeated anomalies that became a 'new normal'. as a result, what we witness today is a considerable turn to behavioral concepts that can shed a new light on choices made by market participants. the astonishing development of social media accelerated scientific validation of such concepts, since the media opened new and capacious 'laboratory space' for testing behavioral hypotheses. the main purpose of the article is to examine whether financial market professionals believe that social media content can be useful in achieving additional financial market returns and to investigate the factors behind this belief. design/methodology/approach: we surveyed a sample of over 400 financial market professionals at institutions operating in poland, and analyzed the results using logit regression models. results: we established that almost 60% of the surveyed finance professionals recognized the potential of social media for achieving additional returns. we also found out that the differences in respondents' perception of this potential could be explained mainly by heterogeneity of their job experience and, to a lesser degree, by their job position. interestingly, more experienced individuals were less likely to recognize this potential. firm-specific factors did not have a significant effect on the dependent variable. conclusion: the opinions of financial market professionals regarding the link between social media and additional returns are mixed, which is consistent with the current body of evidence brought by sentiment-based research. our findings confirm the key role of previous experience in explaining attitudes towards novelties and innovations (such as social media), a phenomenon known from other fields and everyday experience. © 2017 andrzej cwynar et al., published by de gruyter open 2017."
"this paper introduces the concept of divergence of sentiment to the behavioral finance literature. we measure the distance between people with positive and negative sentiment on a daily basis for 20 countries by using data from status updates on facebook. the prediction is that a higher divergence of sentiment leads to more diverging views on prospects and risks, and thus to more diverging views on the value of a stock. in line with this prediction, divergence of sentiment is positively related to trading volume. we further predict and find a positive relation between divergence of sentiment and stock price volatility. the observed relations are stronger when individual investors are more likely to trade. we compare the effect of our country-specific measures to a global measure of divergence of sentiment. we find that the separate effects of country-specific and global divergence measures depend on a country's level of market integration. © 2017 elsevier b.v."
"objectives. to evaluate health impacts of drought during the most severe drought in california's recorded history with a rapid assessment method. methods. we conducted community assessments for public health emergency response during october through november 2015 in tulare county and mariposa county to evaluate household water access, acute stressors, exacerbations of chronic diseases and behavioral health issues, and financial impacts. we evaluated pairwise associations by logistic regression with pooled data. results. by assessment area, households reported not having running water (3%-12%); impacts on finances (25%-39%), property (39%-54%), health (10%-20%), and peace of mind (33%-61%); worsening of a chronic disease (16%-46%); acute stress (8%-26%); and considering moving (14%-34%). impacts on finances or property were each associated with impacts on health and peace of mind, and acute stress. conclusions. drought-impacted households might perceive physical and mental health effects and might experience financial or property impacts related to the drought. public health implications. local jurisdictions should consider implementing drought assistance programs, including behavioral health, and consider rapid assessments to inform public health action."
"stock market index as the composite of a series of representative stocks plays a very crucial role in the financial market. predicting the change of stock market index is vital for investors and stock holders to capture the trend of stocks which they are interested. recently research from behavioral finance suggests that emotions of market participates can influence stock market index. however, variable selection becomes a major challenge. normally, lots of key words related to emotions can be extracted from the social media, meaning that the number of predictor variables p for the data mining methods is very large. traditional variable selection methods require that the number of observations n is sufficient lager and regularization methods could select variables for high dimensional conditions. however, it is common that n is close to p when analyzing the emotions data within a specific time period. under this condition, both variable selection methods are applicable, but few research has been done on it. in this paper, we compare the traditional variable selection method with the regularization method under the condition that n is close to p. then we apply typical data mining methods to predict the sse composite index in china with the selected variables. the results show that the regularization methods give much better performance compared with traditional variable infliction factor (vif) analysis. © 2017 ieee."
"financial crises inflict significant human as well as economic hardship. this paper focuses on the human fallout of capital market stress. financial stress-induced behavioral changes can manifest in higher suicide and murder-suicide rates. we find that these rates also correlate with the gross domestic product (gdp) growth rate (negatively associated; a -0.25% drop [in the rate of change in annual suicides for a +1% change in the independent variable]), unemployment rate (positive link; 0.298% increase), inflation rate (positive link; 0.169% increase in suicide rate levels) and stock market returns adjusted for the risk-free t-bill rate (negative link; -0.047% drop). suicides tend to rise during periods of economic turmoil, such as the recent great recession of 2008. an analysis of centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) data of more than 2 million non-natural deaths in the us since 1980 reveals a positive correlation with unemployment levels. we find that suicides and murder-suicides associated with adverse market sentiment lag the initial stressor by up to two years, thus opening a policy window for government/public health intervention to reduce these negative outcomes. both our models explain about 73 to 76% of the variance in suicide rates and rate of change in suicide rates, and deploy a total of four widely available independent variables (lagged and/or transformed). the results are invariant to the inclusion/exclusion of 2008 data over the 1980–2016 time series, the period of our study. the disconnect between rational decision making, induced by cognitive dissonance and severe financial stress can lead to suboptimal outcomes, not only in the area of investing, but in a direct loss of human capital. no economic system can afford such losses. finance journal articles focus on monetary alpha, which is the return on a portfolio in excess of the benchmark; we think it is important to be aware of the loss of human capital as a consequence of market instability. this study makes one such an attempt. © 2017 agrrawal et al. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited."

"fiscal considerations may shift governmental priorities away from environmental concerns: finance ministers face strong demand for public expenditures such as infrastructure investments but they are constrained by international tax competition. we develop a multi-region model of tax competition and resource extraction to assess the fiscal incentive of imposing a tax on carbon rather than on capital. we explicitly model international capital and resource markets, as well as intertemporal capital accumulation and resource extraction. while fossil resources give rise to scarcity rents, capital does not. with carbon taxes, the rents can be captured and invested in infrastructure, which leads to higher welfare than under capital taxation. this result holds even without modeling environmental damages. it is robust under a variation of the behavioral assumptions of resource importers to coordinate their actions, and a resource exporter’s ability to counteract carbon policies. further, no green paradox occurs—instead, the carbon tax constitutes a viable green policy, since it postpones extraction and reduces cumulative emissions. © 2015, springer science+business media dordrecht."
"this research aims at analyzing factors affecting the use sharia cooperative application at a microfinance institution that implementing sharia system management in srengseng sawah sub district, south jakarta, indonesia. the services delivered by cooperative comprise of business finance (mudaraba), venture capital partnership (musharaka), sales and purchasing (murabaha), leasing (ijara), saving deposits (wadi’ah) and soft loans (al qordhul hasan). based on services offered, an information system namely sharia cooperative application has been developed and implemented to improve its business performances. technology acceptance model was used to analyze behavioral intention to use sharia cooperative application. accordingly, a valid and reliable questionnaire has been developed and distributed to 40 respondents comprises of the management as well as the cadres of the cooperative. a structural equation modeling (sem) was employed to measure the strength of hypothesized relationship among variables comprise of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and attitudes towards usage to behavioral intention to use. the results of the analysis reveals that the behavioral intention to use sharia cooperative application was positively affected by attitude toward usage. attitudes towards usage was positively affected by perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. perceived usefulness was not affected by perceived ease of use. © 2017 american scientific publishers. all rights reserved."
"this paper explores the problem of the global financial crisis of 2008–9, using a behavioral perspective to examine in some detail the issue of governance failures. these failures are evident in the inadequate oversight/regulation provided by us financial market regulators, as well as the inability of financial market participants to adequately judge and assign risk measures to key financial instruments. in total, five elements of behavioral finance are shown to characterize the crisis. the paper shows how specific adjustments in government policy (dealing with market structural imperfections) and company governance (dealing mainly with risk management) can respond to the key elements of the crisis. it also points out that future financial crises cannot be avoided, so that mitigation is the only remedy to deal with such phenomena. © 2017"

"in recent years, merger and acquisition has become the main means of expanding for chinese listed companies. meanwhile, the manager has played an increasingly important role when the company tries to make acquisitions. based on the viewpoint of behavioral finance, managers are more likely to become overconfident. therefore, it is very necessary to apply the theory of managerial overconfidence to the research on motivation of m&a. this paper selects company samples listed between 2013 and 2015 in shanghai and shenzhen stock exchange to do an empirical research about the effect of managerial overconfidence on mergers and acquisitions decision. the conclusion shows that managerial overconfidence significantly influences the mergers and acquisitions decision. in other words, overconfident managers are more inclined to implement mergers and acquisitions. © 2017 ieee."
"in this paper, we introduce a new bayesian approach to explain some market anomalies during financial crises and subsequent recovery. we assume that the earnings shock of an asset follows a random walk model with and without drift to incorporate the impact of financial crises. we further assume the earning shock follows an exponential family distribution to accommodate symmetric as well as asymmetric information. by using this model setting, we develop some properties on the expected earnings shock and its volatility, and establish properties of investor behavior on the stock price and its volatility during financial crises and the subsequent recovery. thereafter, we develop properties to explain excess volatility, short-term underreaction, long-term overreaction, and their magnitude effects during financial crises and the subsequent recovery. we also explain why behavioral finance theory could be used to explain many of the asset pricing anomalies, but traditional asset pricing models cannot achieve this aim. © 2017"

"listed companies' irrational investment behavior was widespread in china. traditional theory explain this phenomenon in the assumption of 'rational economic man'. with the development of behavioral finance theory, research indicates that over-confidence can lead to over-investment decisions. this paper used richardson's residual model to measure over-investment and creatively used shares' rises when roe fall as the measure of overconfidence. we introduced cross item to further study on free cash flow's effect. by analyzing data from 2010 to 2014, we conclude that: (1) managers' overconfidence is positively related to the over-investment. (2) when add the cross terms, the degree of overconfidence impose on over-investment is strengthen; (3) contrast to that in non-manufacture, in manufacture, managers' overconfidence are negatively related to excessive investment; (4) before 2015, the influencing factors contains overconfidence, cash flow, leverage, size and other factors. however, the influencing factors contains only overconfidence in 2015, corporate factors is no longer significant. © 2017 ieee."
"objective: this article reports findings from case studies of 4 states (illinois, louisiana, massachusetts, and tennessee) that used different approaches to coordinate medicaid services with temporary or permanent housing supports for individuals with psychiatric disabilities. method: data were collected through document review, telephone interviews with state officials and managed care organizations, and site visits to behavioral health and housing providers, and consumer organizations. qualitative analyses focused on identifying key features of each state's approach, including the strengths and limitations from multiple perspectives. results: all 4 states facilitated partnerships between behavioral health and housing providers. each state used managed care strategies to some degree and identified opportunities to use medicaid to finance the coordination of services with housing providers. these financing strategies included using flexible case rates to fund community support workers; using a 1915(i) state plan amendment to fund intensive medicaid behavioral health services for those in permanent supportive housing; funding new local entities to support local partnerships between health and housing organizations; and creating a medicaid supportive housing benefit. conclusions and implications for practice: these 4 states took advantage of the flexibility that medicaid offers to implement different service models in an effort to improve the coordination of behavioral health services and housing. the strategies used in these states may be useful to other states and communities seeking to strengthen coordination of care for individuals who require housing support. © 2017 american psychological association."
"we investigate the asymmetric relationship between returns and implied volatility for 20 developed and emerging international markets. in particular we examine how the sign and size of return innovations affect the expectations of daily changes in volatility. our empirical findings indicate that the conditional contemporaneous return-volatility relationship varies not only based on the sign of the expected returns but also upon their magnitude, according to recent results from the behavioral finance literature. we find evidence of an asymmetric and reverse return-volatility relationship in many advanced, asian, latin-american, european and south african markets. we show that the us market displays the highest reaction to price falls, asian markets present the lowest sensitivity to volatility expectations, while the euro area is characterized by a homogeneous response both in terms of direction and impact. these results may be safely attributed to cultural and societal characteristics. an extensive quantile regression analysis demonstrates that the detected asymmetric pattern varies particularly across the extreme distribution tails i.e., in the highest/lowest quantile ranges. indeed, the classical feedback and leverage hypotheses appear not plausible, whilst behavioral theories emerge as the new paradigm in real-world applications. © 2017 elsevier b.v."
"with the continuous progress and development of society and modern business environment, female have played a more and more important role in the corporate governance. as an important component of corporate social responsibility, corporate donation has attracted more and more academic attention. in this study, we shed light on the relationship between female executives' characteristics and corporate donation. with a sample of all a-share listed companies spanning from 2010 to 2016, we investigate the impact of three key characteristics of female executives on corporate donation: education, age and pay. the empirical results show that the education of female executives is significantly correlated with the corporate donation, but female executives' age and the executive pay for female contribute little to the donation. specifically, highly educated female executives are significantly associated with relatively low corporate donation levels. this paper enriches the branch of research of gender effects on corporate social responsibility, and our results carry practical implications for corporate governance, behavioral corporate finance, and human resources. © 2017 ieee."
"most applications of behavioral economics, finance, and accounting research to policy focus on alleviating the adverse effects of individuals' biases and cognitive constraints (e.g. through investor protection rules or nudges). we argue that it is equally important to understand how psychological bias can cause a collective dysfunction - bad accounting policy and financial regulation. we discuss here how psychological bias on the part of the designers of regulation and accounting policy (voters, regulators, politicians, media commentators, managers, users, auditors, and financial professionals) has helped shape existing regulation, and how an understanding of this process can improve regulation in the future. regulatory ideologies are belief systems that have evolved and spread by virtue of their ability to recruit psychological biases. we examine how several psychological factors and social processes affect regulatory ideologies.  copyright © cambridge university press 2017."
"purpose: the purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of the frequency of information acquisition on the frequency of stock trading. the authors also examined if the big five personality traits of investor influence the association between information acquisition and stock trading behavior. design/methodology/approach: the authors adopted neo five-factor inventory (costa and mccrae, 1989) inventory to measure the big five personality traits of investors and examined the data collected from 541 individual investors of the chinese stock market. to overcome the potential endogeneity bias, the authors followed two-stage least square method for estimating endogenous covariate by employing instrumental variable analysis. the authors performed probit regression to evaluate the moderating influence of investor personality traits on the association between information acquisition and stock trading behavior. the authors also performed several other tests to check the robustness of the key findings. findings: this research confirmed the previous findings that the more frequently investors acquire information, the more often they trade in stocks. moreover, the authors added to the existing literature by providing empirical evidence that the big five personality traits moderate the relationship of information acquisition with stock trading behavior. information acquisition tends to increase stock trading frequency in investors with conscientiousness, extraversion and agreeableness traits. on the other hand, it also has the tendency to decrease the intensity of stock trading in investors with openness and neuroticism traits. research limitations/implications: the theoretical model in this study seeks to explain that the psychological factor, namely, investor personality, influences the way an investor interprets signals from information which in turn influences the investor decision to trade in securities. this research suggests that psychological characteristics of investors can be of relevance for policy makers in their attempts to improve their business in the financial services industry. originality/value: this study combines both information search literature and behavioral finance literature to investigate whether or not the information acquisition that relates to investors’ asset allocation decisions is influenced by investor personality. the study offers new theoretical insights into investors’ behavior due to the characteristics of the chinese stock market which are uniquely different from other stock markets in the world. no previous study has been conducted so far in the chinese stock market to explore variations in the impact of investors’ information acquisition on their stock trading by the big five personality and this paper strives to fill this research gap. © 2017, © emerald publishing limited."
"according to behavioral finance, stock market returns are influenced by emotional, social and psychological factors. several recent works support this theory by providing evidence of correlation between stock market prices and collective sentiment indexes measured using social media data. however, a pure correlation analysis is not sufficient to prove that stock market returns are influenced by such emotional factors since both stock market prices and collective sentiment may be driven by a third unmeasured factor. controlling for factors that could influence the study by applying multivariate regression models is challenging given the complexity of stock market data. false assumptions about the linearity or non-linearity of the model and inaccuracies on model specification may result in misleading conclusions. in this work, we propose a novel framework for causal inference that does not require any assumption about a particular parametric form of the model expressing statistical relationships among the variables of the study and can effectively control a large number of observed factors. we apply our method in order to estimate the causal impact that information posted in social media may have on stock market returns of four big companies. our results indicate that social media data not only correlate with stock market returns but also influence them. © 2017 elsevier b.v."
"this article reviews the economic and analytical challenges of adaptation to climate change. adaptation to climate risks that can no longer be avoided is an important aspect of the global response to climate change. humans have always adapted to changing climatic conditions, and there is growing, if still patchy, evidence of widespread adaptation behavior. however, adaptation is not autonomous as sometimes claimed. it requires knowledge, planning, coordination, and foresight. there are important knowledge gaps, behavioral barriers, and market failures that hold back effective adaptation and require policy intervention. we identify the most urgent adaptation priorities, including areas where delay might lock in future vulnerability, and outline the decision-making challenges of adapting to an unknown future climate. we also highlight the strong interlinkages between adaptation and economic development, pointing out that decisions on industrial strategy, urban planning, and infrastructure investment all have a strong bearing on future vulnerability to climate change. we review the implications of these links for adaptation finance and what the literature tells us about the balance between adaptation and mitigation. © 2017 by annual reviews. all rights reserved."
"we quantify the effects of population aging on the u.s. healthcare system. our analysis is based on a stochastic general equilibrium overlapping generations model of endogenous health accumulation calibrated to match pre-2010 u.s. data. we find that population aging not only leads to large increases in medical spending but also a large shift in the relative size of private vs. public insurance. without the affordable care act (aca), aging by itself leads to a 40% increase in health expenditures by 2060 and a 9.6% increase in gdp which is mainly driven by the increase of the fraction of older higher-risk individuals in the economy as well as behavioral responses to aging and the subsequent expansion of the healthcare sector. aging increases the premium in group-based health insurance (ghi) markets and enrollment in ghi decreases, while the individual-based health insurance (ihi) market, medicaid and medicare expand significantly. the size of medicare will almost double by 2060 as the elderly dependency ratio increases. additional funds equivalent to roughly 2.7% of gdp are required to finance medicare and medicaid. the introduction of the aca increases the fraction of insured workers to almost 100% by 2060, compared to 82% without the aca. this increase is driven by the stabilization of ghi markets and the further expansions of medicaid and the ihi market. the aca mitigates the increase of healthcare costs by reducing the number of the uninsured who pay the highest market price for healthcare services. overall, the aca adds to the fiscal cost of population aging mainly via the medicaid expansion. our findings demonstrate the importance of accounting for behavioral responses, structural changes in the healthcare sector and general equilibrium adjustments when assessing the economy-wide effects of aging. © 2017 elsevier b.v."

"the behavioral agent-based framework of de grauwe and gerba (2015) is extended to allow for a counterfactual exercise on the role of corporate finance arrangements for monetary transmission. two alternative firm financial frictions are independently introduced: market-based and bank-based. we find convincing evidence that the overall monetary transmission channel is stronger in the bank-based system compared to the market-based. while the growth in credit is larger in the market-based system, uncertainty originated from imperfect beliefs produce impulse responses in macroeconomic variables that are, on average, half of those in the bank-based model. at the same time we find mixed results on the conditional effectiveness of monetary policy to offset contractions. conditional on being in a recession, a monetary expansion in a market-based system creates higher successive booms. that said, a monetary easing in the bank-based system is more effective in smoothening the financial-and business cycles. © 2017 banco de la república de colombia"

"this paper presents a performance evaluation of stock picking by merging several technical indicators. several fusion operators have been proposed either in the probabilistic or in the possibilistic framework. the latter fuzzy framework has been introduced to manage the uncertain information embedded in financial time series due to human biases as studied by behavioral finance. performances of portfolio resulting from the proposed systems are evaluated according to cumulative returns but also through a risk analysis point of view (sharpe ratio). two fusion mechanisms (one probabilistic, one possibilistic) aiming at discriminating common information from merged technical indicators, produce the higher portfolio performances. it also appears that selecting specific technical indicators affects the overall performances of the proposed stock picking systems. indeed, studying the technical indicators selection through a shared/nonshared information point of view reveals that possibilistic framework is more robust to redundant sources than probabilistic framework. effects of some parameters used in the fusion algorithms (amount of assets, window length analysis, ⋯ are also investigated. results from all these tests clearly show the high potentiality of technical indicators fusion to improve portfolio performances. however, these first promising results have to be further inspected within wider contexts, as discussed at the end of the paper. © 1993-2012 ieee."
"impulsivity is a multifaceted concept that captures an inability to wait, a preference for risky outcomes, a tendency to act without forethought, an insensitivity to consequences, and/or an inability to inhibit inappropriate behaviors. because it touches on so many different aspects of behavior, impulsivity connects to a number of other concepts including patience, self-control, delay of gratification, intertemporal choice, discounting, risky choice, risk taking, inhibitory control, and sensation seeking. therefore, researchers have created a taxonomy that carves up the concept into different types of impulsivity. a primary distinction divides impulsivity into impulsive choice (or decision making) and impulsive action (or disinhibition) based on both behavioral correlates across tasks and neural mechanisms. due to the many different varieties of impulsivity, this concept is of relevance to a large number of fields, including psychology, economics, biology, neuroscience, anthropology, nutrition, finance, and environmental sciences. the current volume reflects the scope of impulsivity by including contributors from a wide range of fields who work across levels of analysis, species, and timescales to understand the many faces of impulsivity. © springer international publishing ag 2017."
"stock investors are not fully rational in trading and many behavioral biases that affect them. however, most of the literature on behavioral finance has put efforts only to explain empirical phenomena observed in financial markets; little attention has been paid to how individual investors' trading performance is affected by behavioral biases. as against the common perception that behavioral biases are always detrimental to investment performance, we conjecture that these biases can sometimes yield better trading outcomes. focusing on representativeness bias, conservatism and disposition effect, we construct a mathematical model in which the representative trend investor follows a bayesian trading strategy based on an underlying markov chain, switching beliefs between trending and meanreversion. by this model, scenario analysis is undertaken to track investor behavior and performance under different patterns of market movements. simulation results show the effect of biases on investor performance can sometimes be positive. further, we investigate how manipulators could take advantage of investor biases to profit. the model's potential for manipulation detection is demonstrated by real data of well-known manipulation cases."
"objective: to explore the relationship between perfectionism and ego-depletion, and the mediating effect of lifestyle actual-ideal self-discrepancy between them. methods: by convenient sampling, the fmps(frost multidimensional perfectionism scale), srf-s(self-regulatory fatigue scale) and self-edited lifestyle actual-ideal self-discrepancy scale were administered to 266 university undergraduate students from renmin university of china and central university of finance and economics in november 2014 for investigating the level of perfectionism, ego-depletion and lifestyle actual-ideal self-discrepancy. the data were processed by spss 17.0.pearson linear correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between fmps scores and srf-s scores. with the fmps scores as independent variable, srf-s scores as the dependent variable, lifestyle actual-ideal self-discrepancy as intermediary variable, we analyzed the relation between the three by three-step mediation regression procedure. in terms of the total score of fmps, subjects who scored the top 27% and the bottom 27% were assigned to the high-score perfectionism group(n=76) and low-score perfectionism group(n=75). the scores of srf-s and lifestyle actual-ideal self-discrepancy were compared between the two groups. results: significant positive correlation was found between fmps and srf-s including its three subscales, cognitive subscale, behavioral subscale and emotional subscale in terms of scoring(p<0.05). results: of three-step mediation regression procedure showed that lifestyle actual-ideal self-discrepancy had a significant partial mediating effect on the relationship between perfectionism and ego-depletion(p<0.05). there were significant differences in srf-s, and its cognitive subscale, behavioral subscale and emotional subscale, ideal lifestyle, lifestyle actual-ideal self-discrepancy in scoring between the high-score perfectionism group and low-score perfectionism group(p<0.05). however, the difference was not statistically significant in score of actual lifestyle(p>0.05). conclusion: perfectionism may positively predict the degree of ego-depletion, in which lifestyle actual-ideal self-discrepancy has a partial mediating effect. copyright © 2017 by the chinese general practice."
"the unprecedented availability of large-scale human behavioral data is profoundly changing the world we live in. researchers, companies, governments, financial institutions, non-governmental organizations and also citizen groups are actively experimenting, innovating and adapting algorithmic decision-making tools to understand global patterns of human behavior and provide decision support to tackle problems of societal importance. in this chapter, we focus our attention on social good decision-making algorithms, that is algorithms strongly influencing decision-making and resource optimization of public goods, such as public health, safety, access to finance and fair employment. through an analysis of specific use cases and approaches, we highlight both the positive opportunities that are created through data-driven algorithmic decision-making, and the potential negative consequences that practitioners should be aware of and address in order to truly realize the potential of this emergent field. we elaborate on the need for these algorithms to provide transparency and accountability, preserve privacy and be tested and evaluated in context, by means of living lab approaches involving citizens. finally, we turn to the requirements which would make it possible to leverage the predictive power of data-driven human behavior analysis while ensuring transparency, accountability, and civic participation. © 2017, springer international publishing ag."

"money laundering is a crime that makes it possible to finance other crimes, for this reason, it is important for criminal organizations and their combat is prioritized by nations around the world. the anti-money laundering process has not evolved as expected because it has prioritized only the signaling of suspicious transactions. the constant increasing in the volume of transactions has overloaded the indispensable human work of final evaluation of the suspicions. this article presents a multiagent system that aims to go beyond the capture of suspicious transactions, seeking to assist the human expert in the analysis of suspicions. the agents created use data mining techniques to create transactional behavioral profiles; apply rules generated in learning process in conjunction with specific rules based on legal aspects and profiles created to capture suspicious transactions; and analyze these suspicious transactions indicating to the human expert those that require more detailed analysis."
"purpose: the purpose of this paper is to investigate which factors will affect the insurance claims adjusters’ attitude and behavior intention toward lenient claims handling practices. these factors include organizational justice, behavioral-based control, significant others, and customer complaints. design/methodology/approach: data are collected with questionnaires from full-time licensed insurance claims adjusters in taiwan. partial least squares method is used to test the hypotheses. findings: the main results show that significant others and organizational justice have significant effects on the claims adjusters’ attitude toward the lenient claims handling practices. significant others and attitude have significant effects on the behavioral intention. originality/value: the influence of claims management on insurance companies’ operation is quite considerable. poor claims management may not only harm insurance companies’ finance, but also affect the adjustment of future premiums. yet, in reality, some claims adjusters are found to make flawed claims decisions. very few studies discuss this problem. this study provides an initial step toward understanding this issue. © 2017, © emerald publishing limited."
"purpose: identify the relationship between the granting of payroll loans and macroeconomic aggregates, from 2004 to 2014, through an analysis of the influence of this type of credit on the aggregate economic activity in brazil. originality/gap/relevance/implications: payroll loans are very representative in the brazilian credit market, and the discussion on this topic is very extensive, because it is directly linked to the economic growth of a country. however, there is a gap in the literature on this subject, since most studies stress behavioral finances, or the legal aspects of contracts, and also because this type of credit is recent in the brazilian economy. key methodological aspects: this is quantitative approach performed through the estimation of the vector error correction model (vecm), which enabled the computation of impulse-response functions, the variance decomposition and the granger causality test. summary of key results: the results indicate that the granting of payroll loans causes an increase on macroeconomic aggregates in the short term, but over longer periods of time this increase tends to be eliminated. key considerations/conclusions: the granting of payroll loans influences the behavior of the economic activity. however, despite the fact that its concession provides leverage in the short term, this growth is not sustainable in the long-term. in this scenario, there is exponential growth in household consumption over the past decade; however, the industry productivity and the investments did not follow this evolution. it is inferred from this that the current growth model generates expansion, but its effects are limited. © 2017 mackenzie presbyterian university. all rights reserved."

"in the chapter we focus on the behavioral determinants of the decision-making process on financial markets. the aim of the research is to indicate and discuss an experiment as a method of identification of behavioral heuristics from the perspective of an investor’s attitude toward risk. the experimental studies are considered on the basis of such behavioral models as the lsv model, the bsv model and other. when the experiment has been completed, an appropriate method of analysis of the interrelations between identified factors is a structural equation model, which is rather rarely applied in behavioral finance but is widely known in empirical psychology. © 2017, springer international publishing ag."
"background: morbidity before retirement has a huge cost, burdening both public health and workplace finances. multiple factors increase morbidity such as stress at work, sedentary behavior or low physical activity, and poor nutrition practices. nowadays, the digital world offers infinite opportunities to interact with workers. the wittyfit software was designed to understand holistic issues of workers by promoting individualized behavior changes at the workplace. objective: the shorter term feasibility objective is to demonstrate that effective use of wittyfit will increase well-being and improve health-related behaviors. the mid-term objective is to demonstrate that wittyfit improves economic data of the companies such as productivity and benefits. the ultimate objective is to increase life expectancy of workers. methods: this is an exploratory interventional cohort study in an ecological situation. three groups of participants will be purposefully sampled: employees, middle managers, and executive managers. four levels of engagement are planned for employees: commencing with baseline health profiling from validated questionnaires; individualized feedback based on evidence-based medicine; support for behavioral change; and formal evaluation of changes in knowledge, practices, and health outcomes over time. middle managers will also receive anonymous feedback on problems encountered by employees, and executive top managers will have indicators by division, location, department, age, seniority, gender and occupational position. managers will be able to introduce specific initiatives in the workplace. wittyfit is based on two databases: behavioral data (wittyfit) and medical data (wittyfit research). statistical analyses will incorporate morbidity and well-being data. when a worker leaves a workplace, the company documents one of three major explanations: retirement, relocation to another company, or premature death. therefore, wittyfit will have the ability to include mortality as an outcome. wittyfit will evolve with the waves of connected objects further increasing its data accuracy. ethical approval was obtained from the ethics committee of the university hospital of clermont-ferrand, france. results: wittyfit recruitment and enrollment started in january 2016. first publications are expected to be available at the beginning of 2017. conclusions: the name wittyfit came from witty and fitness. the concept of wittyfit reflects the concept of health from the world health organization: being spiritually and physically healthy. wittyfit is a health-monitoring, health-promoting tool that may improve the health of workers and health of companies. wittyfit will evolve with the waves of connected objects further increasing its data accuracy with objective measures. wittyfit may constitute a powerful epidemiological database. finally, the wittyfit concept may extend healthy living into the general population. © frédéric dutheil, martine duclos, geraldine naughton, samuel dewavrin, thomas cornet, pascal huguet, jean-claude chatard, bruno pereira. originally published in jmir research protocols (http://www.researchprotocols.org), 13.04.2017. this is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work, first published in jmir research protocols, is properly cited. the complete bibliographic information, a link to the original publication on http://www.researchprotocols.org, as well as this copyright and license information must be included."
"background: although loss of loved ones is a universal experience, individuals who experience this loss grieve in different ways. complicated grief involves the development of trauma symptoms, such as flashbacks, anxiety, and fear associated with daily activities after a death that disrupts the healthy grieving process. daily activities such as eating, meal planning, grocery shopping, managing finances, and household maintenance can become painful and isolating for those experiencing complicated grief. cognitive behavioral therapy is used to address irrational beliefs, feelings of depression or anger, and avoidance or numbing behaviors with a goal of leading the individual to adapting to a life, which no longer includes the lost loved one. objective: as part of the bereavement counseling program in a hospice, a need was identified in individuals who had lost loved ones and were having difficulty with adjusting to meal planning, grocery shopping, and cooking for one. to address this need for grief counseling centered on meal planning, grocery shopping, meal preparations, and eating meals alone, ""culinary grief therapy: cooking for one series"" was developed with a local culinary arts program. design: partnering with a local community college culinary arts program, the cooking for one series provides an interactive venue for cognitive behavioral therapy centered on meal planning and meal times. along with demonstrations and hands-on experiences, participants are engaged in bereavement counseling with hospice staff. results: initial reactions to culinary grief therapy have been positive. many attendees have participated in multiple workshops, and the number of participants grows for each offering. conclusions: culinary grief therapy is a novel approach to the needs of those experiencing the loss of a loved one and may reduce or prevent complicated grief associated with meal planning, grocery shopping, and cooking for one. © copyright 2017, mary ann liebert, inc."
"investors’ responses to a firm’s name change and the determinants of their response are scantly explored areas in the field of behavioral finance. based on a sample of 415 indian firms from 2005 to 2014, this study suggests that investors respond positively to the announcement of firm name changes. furthermore, the study indicates that when firms do not indicate geographical specificity in the name and have a specific rather than generic name, then the firm will experience greater abnormal returns. also, when firm names are fluent and are associated with the owner’s family name, again, abnormal returns generated are positive. nevertheless, as a firm ages and investors gain more information about it, then abnormal returns due to name change decrease. © 2016 international journal of the economics of business."
"the purpose of this study is to analyze and critically review the role of credit rating agencies in financial markets. the remarkable disappointment of top-rated structured finance products in the subprime crisis has placed renewed attention on credit rating agencies. as a result of this development, the ongoing debate about whether market forces provide sufficient control of rating agencies or whether regulation is necessary has been rekindled. the discussion focuses on the argument that the reputation of a credit rating agency is sufficient to discipline them. this essay contributes to this debate by providing a behavioral perspective. the introduction provides a brief historical overview and examines the role of credit rating agencies in financial markets. the second section addresses the role of rating agencies in the subprime crisis by highlighting the conflict of interest problem, ratings quality and regulation. the next section analyzes the effects of us- and eu-based regulations. the main contribution of this paper is made in the last section, which points out the behavioral perspective on credit ratings. © springer international publishing ag 2017."
"this paper develops a conceptual map in the field of behavioral finance related to asset pricing, by a review and synthesis of the literature. we analyze the empirical evidence of financial market anomalies related with overreaction and underreaction and present an overview of the main psychological theories that describe irrational investor behavior: the representativeness heuristic and prospect theory. we go on to describe and classify the behavioral models based on overconfidence, loss aversion, herding and other irrational biases that explain the lack of correlation between risk and return in the financial markets. in order to contribute to further systematization in the field, we categorize behavioral models into three distinct groups and we draw a conceptual map showing the relationship between these models and the referred psychological theories. finally, we address the critics and alternative theories and identify issues for further research, introducing, among others, the concepts of rational irrationality and the time variable as the key factors in the analysis of irrational market behavior. © international economic society."
"challenges are faced by individuals in making financial decisions throughout their life to be financially well. managing risk such as health risks may incur high cost to remain healthy. individuals make decisions on having protection against health risks in the long run which depends on several factors. this study focused on the behavioral aspects of finance which attempts to assess factors predicting health insurance purchase among malaysian public sector employees. the likelihood of personality and health risks factors in predicting health insurance purchase were determined. multistage random sampling based on four zones in peninsular malaysia was utilized to sample 500 respondents from four states. selected departments in the states were contacted prior to the data collection for their consent. respondents identified by liaison officers in each department were given self-administered questionnaires resulting in 356 usable questionnaires. apart from socioeconomic characteristics and health insurance purchase, data on investment, personality and health status were collected. personalities measured were self-esteem, risk-averse and future-orientation, while health risks were measured through health status using sf-36. the primarily measures and the aggregate measures of health were analyzed in two separate binomial logistic regressions where both analyses revealed that income was the strongest predictor as compared to investment activity or self-esteem. none of the indicators for health risks was found to be significant in predicting health insurance purchase. both models were justified as fit by being moderately correctly classified and were more than 25% improvement over the chance accuracy rate. it is concluded that the decision on protection against health risks using health insurance is not based on their health risks instead the decision depends more on their income. as these are employees in the public sector, it may reflect high reliance on the government health service. nevertheless, the public sector is considered as a potential market for health insurance industry. © 2017, springer international publishing ag."

"a large literature in empirical public finance relies on “bunching” to identify a behavioral response to non-linear incentives and to translate this response into an economic object to be used counterfactually. we conduct this type of analysis in the context of prescription drug insurance for the elderly in medicare part d, where a kink in the individual's budget set generates substantial bunching in annual drug expenditure around the famous “donut hole.” we show that different alternative economic models can match the basic bunching pattern, but have very different quantitative implications for the counterfactual spending response to alternative insurance contracts. these findings illustrate the importance of modeling choices in mapping a compelling reduced form pattern into an economic object of interest. © 2016 elsevier b.v."

"with the exception of a few parts of chapters 9 and 10, everything we have discussed until now has assumed that people act and make decisions as utility-maximizing rational actors. that assumption provides a useful basis for doing analysis to help people make decisions, but it falls short when we are trying to anticipate how people perceive and remember things that are important to the formulation of public policy, or how they are likely to make decisions in the presence of uncertainty. these issues are in the domain of a special branch of empirical social science, largely developed by experts in psychology, that is now often called “decision science” or the science of “judgment and decision making.” i say empirical social science because this important understanding has grown out of a solid base of carefully designed experimental studies, studies whose results, like those in other fields of science, have been repeatedly replicated and verified. fischhoff (2010) explains: over the past 40 years, the study of judgment and decision making has spread widely, first to social psychology … then to application areas like accounting, health, and finance, finally penetrating mainstream economics under the banner of behavioral economics. that success owes something to the power of the approach, which liberated researchers previously bound by rational-actor models for describing behavior. it also owes something to the fascination of results that address a central aspect of the human condition, individuals’ competence to manage their own affairs. there is obviously no way to cover all the insights from this body of research in a single chapter, or, for that matter, in just a course or two. here i do four things: outline a few of the key experimental results, suggest a few original papers that i urge you to read to get a sense of what empirical studies in this field look like, suggest that you read some excellent summary accounts of key ideas written by robin dawes (1988), and recommend a few other books to which interested readers can turn for more detail. © m. granger morgan 2017."
"in financial decisions and markets, john campbell, one of the field’s most respected authorities, provides a broad graduate-level overview of asset pricing. he introduces students to leading theories of portfolio choice, their implications for asset prices, and empirical patterns of risk and return in financial markets. campbell emphasizes the interplay of theory and evidence, as theorists respond to empirical puzzles by developing models with new testable implications. the book shows how models make predictions not only about asset prices but also about investors’ financial positions, and how they often draw on insights from behavioral economics. after a careful introduction to single-period models, campbell develops multiperiod models with time-varying discount rates, reviews the leading approaches to consumption-based asset pricing, and integrates the study of equities and fixed-income securities. he discusses models with heterogeneous agents who use financial markets to share their risks, but also may speculate against one another on the basis of different beliefs or private information. campbell takes a broad view of the field, linking asset pricing to related areas, including financial econometrics, household finance, and macroeconomics. the textbook works in discrete time throughout, and does not require stochastic calculus. problems are provided at the end of each chapter to challenge students to develop their understanding of the main issues in financial economics. the most comprehensive and balanced textbook on asset pricing available, financial decisions and markets is an essential resource for all graduate students and practitioners in finance and related fields. • integrated treatment of asset pricing theory and empirical evidence • emphasis on investors’ decisions • broad view linking the field to financial econometrics, household finance, and macroeconomics • topics treated in discrete time, with no requirement for stochastic calculus • solutions manual for problems available to professors. © 2018 by princeton university press."
"capital and financing structure are considered of a crucial importance for the operational and financial sustainability of microfinance institutions (mfis). therefore, each decision making process is of the same importance for these institutions. the purpose of this study is to draw attentions toward the microfinance sector and to take into consideration the human factor and the role that managers play in funding and financing modalities and decision making process in microfinance institutions. in this context, this paper explores the differences between conventional and islamic mfis’ capital structure choices on one hand. and, reviews the insights provided by the literature examining capital structure decisions and managerial behavioral biases on the other hand. the theoretical and comparative analysis revealed the substantial differences between capital structure of both conventional and islamic mfis. furthermore, the empirical literature points that managers’ behavioral biases play an important role in explaining the capital structure choices. microfinance institutions still has not been subject of behavioral finance studies. thus, the discussion emphasizes the theoretical and empirical limitations on this field. in addition, the discussion stresses the importance of studying the behavioral traits of mfis’ managers and their role in explaining capital structure choices. © 2018 acrn oxford ltd. all rights reserved."
"the authors tested a leading theory of bubble formation, insufficient learning, in a laboratory asset market using a drug, naltrexone, which inhibits reinforcement learning. we found that asset price bubbles in naltrexone sessions were larger compared with placebo sessions, averaging 60% higher in amplitude and 77% larger in the deviation from fundamental value in the final 12-period trading round. there was no difference between conditions in understanding of the trading rules, overconfidence, or confusion. participants on naltrexone appeared unable to determine appropriate trading strategies as prices changed. the findings indicate that specific neural mechanism of reinforcement learning is involved in the formation of asset market bubbles. © 2017 the institute of behavioral finance."
"the relation between informed trading and volatility is analyzed using the change in the proportion of informed transactions calculated through the probability of informed trading variable. the analysis relates to the spanish market during 1997–2010, given that the spanish market covers a very diverse range of listed companies. some companies are comparable to companies listed on u.s. markets while others are smaller in size and have a lower trading volume and inferior quality of information. the methodology is based on a modification of the model proposed by avramov, chordia, and goyal [2006]. the authors’ proposal incorporates the change in the proportion of informed transactions, calculated with intraday data, into the volatility model. the results are also presented using a conditional volatility model in which the change in the proportion of informed transactions is incorporated. these results attest to the influence of informed trading as a price-stabilizing factor in heavily traded and highly capitalized stocks (familiar stocks). informed trading leads to a marked decrease in volatility for these particular stocks both in periods of calm and crisis. © 2017 the institute of behavioral finance."
"objectives of the paper are to explore the current state of business engagement in adaptation to climate change, identify hidden drivers and barriers of adaptation, and to find ways to accelerate the engagement process in a highly climate vulnerable developing country. based on behavioral perspective, the authors deployed a qualitative multiple case study research to investigate three significant business sectors in bangladesh namely telecom, real estate and garments manufacturing. findings show that their overall perception of climate change impacts on businesses is still unclear. their present engagements in adaptation can be termed as co-adaptation with other regular organizational changes. majority of adaptation decisions are reactive. businesses show more sensitivity to non-climatic factors (e.g. regulation, market-force) than direct climatic factors like extreme weather events. they follow ‘wait and see’ or ‘deferred’ adaptation approaches, and in some cases, also absorb risks or shift the risks to other businesses. there exist a number of internal and external drivers and barriers that are directly or indirectly determine adaptation decision. lack of awareness and wrong perception are the main barriers. however, unavailability of information and adaptation finance, costly adaptation technology, poor organizational leadership, corruption, political unrest, and unfavorable policy are significantly hampering their adaptation process. © 2017, universiti malaysia sarawak. all rights reserved."
"individual investors select high-fee index mutual funds despite the fact that the future payouts are nearly identical. the authors offer an explanation for this violation of the law of one price based on investor desire to diversify. while diversification in some settings may be beneficial, in the case of assets with identical payouts, fee minimization is the only rational strategy. the evidence confirms that investors diversify by selecting multiple higher fee funds rather than minimizing fees when investing in index mutual funds. © 2017 the institute of behavioral finance."
"this chapter describes the causes of housing bubbles, why they eventually burst, and the macroeconomic effects of bubbles. housing bubbles concentrate their impact in the home building, materials and furnishings, real estate sales, and mortgage businesses. there are three basic views of bubbles that are held by economists and the general public. the mainstream view does not believe in bubbles and attributes such changes in the economy to real factors such as technology shocks, and believes there is nothing the government can do to solve such real problems. the second view, which is espoused by keynesians and by proponents of behavioral finance, is that bubbles exist because of psychological factors such as those captured by the phrase “irrational exuberance.” the austrian business cycle (abc) theory incorporates real and psychological changes into a view where bubbles are caused by the policy manipulation of the federal reserve. © 2009 by the independent institute, oakland, california. all rights reserved."
"nonresponse in field surveys is the joint outcome of the decision of survey staff to apply effort to inform and persuade respondents, and the evaluation of such inputs by respondents. in most such surveys, the field staff are under great pressure to produce completed interviews. thus, they have an incentive to apply effort to cases that are most likely, in their view, to be completed with least effort. to the extent that interviewers' perceptions are unbiased, such behavior would tend to amplify latent patterns of nonresponse. when the characteristics of respondents that affect the likelihood of participation are correlated with variables of analytical interest in the survey, bias results, unless a means can be found of discovering and adjusting for the underlying behavioral structures. but, absent constraints on the behavior of interviewers, the observed outcomes are contaminated by the endogeneity of effort, and only strong a priori assumptions could disentangle the interviewer effects from the respondent effects. to address the problem of endogenous effort, the 2004 survey of consumer finances introduced a phased plan of sample management to make effort more nearly exogenous through the first two of three phases of field work. thus, nonresponse in these controlled stages should largely reflect respondent characteristics, not a mixture of respondent and interviewer characteristics. the dual frame design of the scf offers two classes of sample cases for modeling nonresponse. for the area-probability sample, tract-level data are available from the 2000 census of population. for the list sample, case-specific data based on statistical records derived from tax returns are available. for both set of cases, some interviewer observations are also available. this paper presents estimates of nonresponse models based on these data. © 2017 - ios press and the authors. all rights reserved."
"problem/condition: as a result of the 2010 patient protection and affordable care act, millions of u.s. adults attained health insurance coverage. however, millions of adults remain uninsured or underinsured. compared with adults without barriers to health care, adults who lack health insurance coverage, have coverage gaps, or skip or delay care because of limited personal finances might face increased risk for poor physical and mental health and premature mortality. period covered: 2014. description of system: the behavioral risk factor surveillance system (brfss) is an ongoing, state-based, landline- and cellular-telephone survey of noninstitutionalized adults aged =18 years residing in the united states. data are collected from states, the district of columbia, and participating u.s. territories on health risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, health care access, and use of clinical preventive services (cps). an optional health care access module was included in the 2014 brfss. this report summarizes 2014 brfss data from all 50 states and the district of columbia on health care access and use of selected cps recommended by the u.s. preventive services task force or the advisory committee on immunization practices among working-aged adults (aged 18-64 years), by state, state medicaid expansion status, expanded geographic region, and federal poverty level (fpl). this report also provides analysis of primary type of health insurance coverage at the time of interview, continuity of health insurance coverage during the preceding 12 months, and other health care access measures (i.e., unmet health care need because of cost, unmet prescription need because of cost, medical debt [medical bills being paid off over time], number of health care visits during the preceding year, and satisfaction with received health care) from 43 states that included questions from the optional brfss health care access module. results: in 2014, health insurance coverage and other health care access measures varied substantially by state, state medicaid expansion status, expanded geographic region (i.e., states categorized geographically into nine regions), and fpl category. the following proportions refer to the range of estimated prevalence for health insurance and other health care access measures by examined geographical unit (unless otherwise specified), as reported by respondents. among adults with health insurance coverage, the range was 70.8%-94.5% for states, 78.8%-94.5% for medicaid expansion states, 70.8%-89.1% for nonexpansion states, 73.3%-91.0% for expanded geographic regions, and 64.2%-95.8% for fpl categories. among adults who had a usual source of health care, the range was 57.2%-86.6% for states, 57.2%-86.6% for medicaid expansion states, 61.8%-83.9% for nonexpansion states, 64.4%-83.6% for expanded geographic regions, and 61.0%-81.6% for fpl categories. among adults who received a routine checkup, the range was 52.1%-75.5% for states, 56.0%-75.5% for medicaid expansion states, 52.1%-71.1% for nonexpansion states, 56.8%-70.2% for expanded geographic regions, and 59.9%-69.2% for fpl categories. among adults who had unmet health care need because of cost, the range was 8.0%-23.1% for states, 8.0%-21.9% for medicaid expansion states, 11.9%-23.1% for nonexpansion states, 11.6%-20.3% for expanded geographic regions, and 5.3%-32.9% for fpl categories. estimated prevalence of cancer screenings, influenza vaccination, and having ever been tested for human immunodeficiency virus also varied by state, state medicaid expansion status, expanded geographic region, and fpl category. the prevalence of insurance coverage varied by approximately 25 percentage points among racial/ethnic groups (range: 63.9% among hispanics to 88.4% among non-hispanic asians) and by approximately 32 percentage points by fpl category (range: 64.2% among adults with household income <100% of fpl to 95.8% among adults with household income >400% of fpl). the prevalence of unmet health care need because of cost varied by nearly 14 percentage points among racial/ethnic groups (range: 11.3% among non-hispanic asians to 25.0% among hispanics), by approximately 17 percentage points among adults with and without disabilities (30.8% versus 13.7%), and by approximately 28 percentage points by fpl category (range: 5.3% among adults with household income >400% of fpl to 32.9% among adults with household income <100% of fpl). among the 43 states that included questions from the optional module, a majority of adults reported private health insurance coverage (63.4%), followed by public health plan coverage (19.4%) and no primary source of insurance (17.1%). financial barriers to health care (unmet health care need because of cost, unmet prescribed medication need because of cost, and medical bills being paid off over time [medical debt]) were typically lower among adults in medicaid expansion states than those in nonexpansion states regardless of source of insurance. approximately 75.6% of adults reported being continuously insured during the preceding 12 months, 12.9% reported a gap in coverage, and 11.5% reported being uninsured during the preceding 12 months. the largest proportion of adults reported =3 visits to a health care professional during the preceding 12 months (47.3%), followed by 1-2 visits (37.1%), and no health care visits (15.6%). adults in expansion and nonexpansion states reported similar levels of satisfaction with received health care by primary source of health insurance coverage and by continuity of health insurance coverage during the preceding 12 months. interpretation: this report presents for the first time estimates of population-based health care access and use of cps among adults aged 18-64 years. the findings in this report indicate substantial variations in health insurance coverage other health care access measures; and use of cps by state, state medicaid expansion status, expanded geographic region, and fpl category. in 2014, health insurance coverage, having a usual source of care, having a routine checkup, and not experiencing unmet health care need because of cost were higher among adults living below the poverty level (i.e., household income <100% of fpl) in states that expanded medicaid than in states that did not. similarly, estimates of breast and cervical cancer screening and influenza vaccination were higher among adults living below the poverty level in states that expanded medicaid than in states that did not. these disparities might be due to larger differences to begin with, decreased disparities in medicaid expansion states versus nonexpansion states, or increased disparities in nonexpansion states. public health action: brfss data from 2014 can be used as a baseline by which to assess and monitor changes that might occur after 2014 resulting from programs and policies designed to increase access to health care, reduce health disparities, and improve the health of the adult population. post-2014 changes in health care access, such as source of health insurance coverage, attainment and continuity of coverage, financial barriers, preventive care services, and health outcomes, can be monitored using these baseline estimates."
"recent years have seen a large expansion in the use of rigorous impact evaluation techniques. increasingly, public administrations are collaborating with academic economists and other quantitative social scientists to apply such rigorous methods to the study of public finance. these developments allow for more reliable measurements of the effects of different policy options on the behavioral responses of citizens, firm owners, or public officials. they can help decision makers in tax administrations, public procurement offices, and other public agencies design programs informed by well-founded evidence. this article provides an introductory overview of the most frequently used impact evaluation methods. it is aimed at facilitating communication and collaboration between practitioners and academics by introducing key vocabulary and concepts used in rigorous impact evaluation methods, starting with randomized controlled trials and comparing them with other methods ranging from simple pre–post analysis to difference-in-differences, matching estimations, and regression discontinuity designs. © 2015, © the author(s) 2015."

"as a market-based mechanism which can actively promote energy efficiency, energy performance contracting (epc) is now universally accepted throughout china and has been incorporated into various business models. four of these business models are frequently adopted in china: the share savings model, the guaranteed savings model, the energy-cost trust model and the finance lease model. the choice of a suitable business model has been recognized as one of the most important factors in the effective implementation of epc projects. in this paper, the selection of epc business models is formulated as a multi-criteria decision making (mcdm) problem. when selecting an epc business model, it is natural for decision-makers (dms) to express their preferences/opinions in linguistic terms. given the characteristics of epc projects, taking dms' psychological behavior into account is of considerable and realistic significance. todim (an acronym in portuguese of interactive and multicriteria decision making) has been verified as an effective behavioral decision-making method. to address the problem of epc business model selection, an extended todim method based on multi-granularity linguistic terms and entropy measure is proposed. the sensitivity and comparison analyses show that dms' psychological behavior can affect the selection order with respect to the given epc business models. one case of a real-life campus epc project demonstrates that the validity and applicability of the proposed extended todim method for solving the epc business model selection problem. © 2017 elsevier ltd"
"the efficient market hypothesis (emh) has been around since 1962. it is a theory based on a simple rule, which states that the price of any asset must fully reflect all available information. yet, there is empirical evidence suggesting that markets are too volatile to be efficient. in essence, this evidence suggests that the reaction of market participants to information or events is the crucial factor, rather than the information itself. this highlights the need to include behavioral finance theory in the pricing of assets. this paper aims to analyze the efficiency of the greek, italian, portuguese and spanish (ie, gips) sovereign debt markets during crises: in essence, the recent global financial and sovereign debt crises. we use a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (garch)-based variance bound test to test the null hypothesis of the market being too volatile to be efficient. in general, our emh tests gave mixed results; this points to an acceptance of our null hypothesis that the market is too volatile to be efficient. interestingly, a number of observations also pointed to a rejection of the null hypothesis that the market is too volatile to be efficient. © 2017 incisive risk information (ip) limited."
"purpose: this paper aims to find alternative explanations for the use of long-term debt in the us restaurant industry from a behavioral perspective. the three-fold purpose of the present study is to examine the impact of ceo overconfidence on the use of long-term debt; explore how ceo overconfidence moderates the relationship between growth opportunities and long-term debt; and analyze the moderating role of ceo overconfidence based on cash flow levels in the context of the restaurant industry. design/methodology/approach: using a sample of publicly traded us restaurant firms between 1992 and 2015, this study used generalized methods of moments with instrumental variable technique to analyze the panel data. findings: the findings of this study highlight the importance of considering behavioral traits of ceos, such as overconfidence to better understand the us restaurant firms’ financing behaviors. this study found that overconfident ceos tend to use more long-term debt when firms have greater growth opportunities and low cash flow. practical implications: given that psychological and behavioral features of ceos are critical in understanding the variations in corporate financing decisions and capital structure, shareholders and boards of directors of growth-seeking restaurant firms should incorporate the behavioral aspects of overconfident ceos in the design of long-term debt contracts to mitigate liquidation risk while developing compensation practices that encourage overconfident ceos to finance growth. originality/value: despite its heavy reliance on long-term debt in the us hospitality industry, prior studies provided mixed findings for the determinants of long-term debt. this study makes a contribution to the literature by offering alternative approaches to examining long-term debt decisions among us restaurant firms. © 2017, © emerald publishing limited."
"a large volume of research has examined agent risk taking and the contracting problem of risk sharing - the sharing of performance risk across agent and principal - to advance our knowledge of mechanisms that can align the assumed divergent interests and risk preferences of the managerial agent and shareholder principal. this research has been undertaken in two streams - financial economics and behavioral science - that appear to have operated in silos, using different theoretical frameworks and methodological approaches. to identify opportunities for cross-fertilization and to advance future research in both streams, we review the theoretical paradigms and empirical findings deriving from both fields. we also make an assessment of how the combined research efforts of finance and behavioral scholars have progressed in developing our understanding of agent risk taking and mechanisms for achieving agent-principal incentive alignment. finally, we discuss how this research has influenced the corporate world for better or for worse. © academy of management perspectives."
"behavioral finance has captivated considerable importance in the last two decades. it is because investors rarely adhere to the assumptions put forward by the traditional and economic theories. behavioral finance is a study of psychological variables, which influence the investors' financial decisions. behavioral finance encompasses investigation that drops the traditional assumptions of logical investors in efficient markets that aim to derive maximum utility. the existent literature is bereft of any literature review based consolidated work on behavioral finance. relying on extant literature this paper unfolds the theoretical foundations of behavioral finance. it focuses on published international research on investor behavior from across the world. the paper deliberates upon the traditional behavioral theories and attempts to underpin the contemporary theories and models of behavioral finance. the paper is structured as a comprehensive literature review of behavioral finance, and includes both the seminal works as well as more recent papers. while the existing research work has helped in developing a good level of understanding in numerous issues pertaining to behavioral finance, but thereafter several research questions remain unanswered. further, no effort was made to consolidate and synthesize this stream of research. the study tries to present the key issues in current and emerging literature and propose important questions and directions for future research. © serials publications pvt. ltd."
"economic and social policies vary across countries, reflecting their cultures and shaping them. people in some countries are more loss averse than in others. people in some countries express stronger preferences for income equality than do people in others, and some countries offer stronger safety nets than others do. the cultural dimension of uncertainty avoidance expresses the degree to which people in a country feel uncomfortable with uncertainty and the way a country deals with the fact that the future can never be known. the author finds that uncertainty avoidance is associated with loss aversion. people are more loss averse in the domains of both portfolios and jobs in countries where uncertainty avoidance is high. moreover, people in countries where uncertainty avoidance is high express stronger preferences for income equality, and social spending in such countries is high. the cultural dimension of power distance expresses the degree to which the less powerful members of a society accept and expect that power is distributed unequally. the author finds that people in countries where power distance is high express weaker preference for income equality, and social spending in such countries is low. © 2016 the institute of behavioral finance."
"this paper investigates the motives, behavior, and characteristics shaping mutual fund managers' willingness to incorporate environmental, social and governance (esg) issues into investment decision making. using survey evidence from fund managers from five different countries, we demonstrate that this predisposition is the stronger, the shorter their average forecasting horizon and the higher their level of reliance on business risk in portfolio management is. we also find that the propensity to incorporate esg factors is positively related to an increasing level of risk aversion, an increasing importance of salary change and senior management approval/disapproval as motivating factors as well as length of professional experience in current fund and increasing significance of assessment by superiors in remuneration. overall, our evidence suggests that esg diligence among fund managers serves mainly as a method for mitigating risk and is typically motivated by herding; it is much less important as a tool for additional value creation. the prevalent use of esg criteria in mitigating risk is in contrast with traditional approach, but it is in line with behavioral finance theory. additionally, our results also show a strong difference in the length of the forecasting horizon between continental european and anglo-saxon fund managers. © 2016 by the authors."
"purpose: literacy represents one’s ability to process and produce materials related to a domain. one type of this higher-order, global individual difference variable is consumer financial literacy. it stems from one’s financial information processing capacity, prior financial knowledge, and proficiency in optimizing financial decisions and managing financial resources. the paper aims to discuss these issues. design/methodology/approach: the research matching perspective theoretically explains findings related to literacy, including those in this special issue. optimal processing arises as available and required processing resources correspond. thus, cognitive comprehension and behavioral application/decision-making outcomes following financial marketing communication exposure are optimized when consumer financial literacy matches the level needed for successful processing. insufficient or excess available resources harm outcomes. findings: the resource-matching perspective clarifies consumers’ increasing financial difficulties. consumers limit personal finance efforts because required resources overwhelm limited financial literacy. however, education or experience can expand consumer financial literacy. alternatively, financial service marketers may accommodate low consumer financial literacy by simplifying financial information presentation. consumers reward firms that show sensitivity to their domain-specific literacy limitations with stronger loyalty. research limitations/implications: construct definition is vital to advance research. yet, financial literacy has no generally accepted definition. this paper’s definitions should aid understanding of the psychological underpinnings of financial literacy’s components. originality/value: much has been written about consumers’ inability to manage personal finances. this paper provides a unified, theoretical explanation for consumers increasing financial literacy difficulties and suggests ways that consumers, financial service providers, and public policy makers can overcome these difficulties. © 2017, © emerald publishing limited."
"the value premium's persistence and magnitude run counter to the behavioral explanation of the value anomaly. how can investors continue to make the same widely recognized mistake? by examining the difference between mutual funds' reported buyandhold or timeweighted returns, and the average dollarweighted returns or irrs end investors earn, the authors quantify the consistently negative effect of value investors' markettiming decisions: from 1991 to 2013, value mutual fund investors underperformed the funds they invested in by 131 basis points. their analysis also reveals that investors in growth, largecap, and smallcap funds are similarly prone to unproductive allocation timing. they also find that less sophisticated investors tend to make poorer timing decisions. investors who hold funds with high expense ratios had larger return gaps than those who chose less costly funds, and investors in retail funds underperformed by a greater margin than those who qualified for institutional shareclass funds. the authors suggest that, by giving away the excess return, value investors themselves finance the value premium and ensure its continuance. financial education may help individual investors refrain from trading their funds in a counterproductive fashion. © 2015 institutional investor llc. all rights reserved."

"purpose: while previous research has developed unclear positions about the role of organizational resources on alliance formation, the purpose of this paper is to focus on financial slack resources to clarify the conditions that facilitate the formation of strategic alliances. building on the behavioral theory of the firm, this paper theorizes that internal and external financial slack resources, measured as cash holdings and financial leverage, incentivize managers to form alliances, because they protect them against the risk of alliance failure. design/methodology/approach: complete data were collected from 400 biotech public companies for the period from 2000 to 2015. the data set considered alliances among over 2,200 public and private companies. hypothesis testing relied on generalized estimating equations. findings: cash holdings positively impact alliance formation; financial leverage negatively impacts alliance formation; cash holdings and financial leverage interact in the prediction of alliance formation. research limitations/implications: while research in financial slack resources shows equivocal results, this study illustrates that they exercise a significant effect when it comes to the choice of forming strategic alliances. limitations include the focus on multiple forms of alliances, possible restrictions in the external validity of the findings, and a lack of measurement of explanatory mechanisms. practical implications: findings help managers understand the financial conditions in which they should choose to form or avoid alliances; findings help managers select alliance partners. originality/value: the study contributes by proposing a new outlook on alliances; identifying financial resources as alliance predictors when previous research focused on intangible resources; offering new insights into the often equivocal outcomes of financial slack; building an uncharted bridge between the finance and alliance literatures. © 2017, © emerald publishing limited."
"purpose: the purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of the key sources of information, namely, financial advice, word-of-mouth communication and specialized press, on trading behavior of chinese stock investors. the study also analyzed if the association between the key sources of information and trading behavior is influenced by investor personality. design/methodology/approach: the authors adopted the big five personality framework and examined the survey results of individual stock investors (n=541) in china. personality traits of investors were measured by the neo-five factor inventory (costa and mccrae, 1989). the authors performed probit regression analysis to evaluate the moderating influence of investor personality traits on the association between sources of information and stock trading behavior. findings: the results of the study confirm the previous findings that the key sources of information used by investors as a foundation of their financial choices have a significant influence on their trading behavior. the study also provides empirical evidence that investor personality traits moderate the relationship between the key sources of information and trading behavior. financial advisors tend to increase the frequency of trading in investors with openness, extraversion, neuroticism and agreeableness personality traits, and tend to decrease the intensity of trading in investors with conscientiousness trait. on the other hand, financial information acquired from word-of-mouth communication is more likely to enhance trading frequency in extraverted and agreeable investors, and is more likely to reduce trading frequency in investors with openness, conscientiousness and neuroticism traits. finally, the use of specialized press leads to more adjustment in portfolios of the investors with openness and conscientiousness traits than those with other personality traits. an alternative mediated model was not supported. originality/value: this research contributes to information search literature and behavioral finance literature and provides empirical evidence that the psychological characteristics of investors are significant predictors of the variations in information-trading link. the study offers new theoretical insights of investors’ behavior due to the characteristics of chinese stock market which are unique from other stock markets in the world. to the authors’ best knowledge, no previous study has been conducted so far in chinese stock market to explore variations with regards to the impact of the key sources of information on trading behavior by the big five investor personality and this paper seeks to fill this gap. © 2017, © emerald publishing limited."

"this paper summarizes, as of 2000, the history of the survey of consumer finances (scf) and the supporting structure for measuring household wealth with that survey. surveys are the large scientific measurement devices of the social sciences. each set of observations rests heavily on theories - statistical theories about sampling, missing data, inference, and other such formal issues, cognitive theories about how people perceive the data collection process and respond to it, behavioral theories that deal with the different incentives that operate on all parties in the data collection, and even social theories that address the ways that we interpret the process and its outcomes. each aspect of these theories has a role in characterizing the ""results"" of the cumulation of processes that make up a survey. for the scf, the most pressing issues are persuading respondents to participate and, given participation, to provide accurate data. many measurement problems are amplified by the fact that the distribution of wealth is highly skewed. © 2017 - ios press and the authors. all rights reserved."
"purpose: the purpose of this paper is to develop benchmarking standards for risk premiums in capitalization rates and commercial mortgage rates, to examine the impact of investor choice of property type and geographic markets on those risk premiums, and to supplement the quantitative analysis with historical and behavioral decision-making factors. design/methodology/approach: using data sets extending from 1q 1995 to 2q 2016, a range of risk premiums is calculated and norms established at the 65th and 35th percentiles by property type and investment position. relative levels of the risk premiums are compared to three defined categories of urban markets, to discover potential risks in yield-seeking market selection. a historical context is discussed to illustrate that prudential judgment is needed to supplement statistical measures of risk. findings: a stable range of risk premiums is identified for the pre-financial crisis period 1995-2003, the dislocations of risk pricing 2004-2007 leads to an extreme reaction 2009-2012. a period of “renormalization” is hypothesized thereafter. an important distinction is made between the transaction peak of 2007, and the numerically similar peak of 2015. taxonomy of urban property markets is adduced. practical implications: investment analyses and portfolio allocation decisions can benefit from a longitudinal examination of risk premiums hitherto unavailable. the proposed taxonomy of markets has been shown (elsewhere) to correlate to investment performance. city planners may wish to capture increased real estate value stemming from investor preferences among cities. originality/value: the risk premium benchmarking is not previously available in the scholarly literature. the historical context as a prudential element in evaluating risk is not often emphasized in the finance literature. © 2017, © emerald publishing limited."
"purpose: the house money effect is proposed to describe that people appear to consider large or unexpected wealth gains to be distinct from the rest of their wealth, and are thus more willing to gamble with such gains than they ordinarily would be. on the other hand, the availability heuristic describes that people tend to have a cognitive and systematic bias due to their reliance on easily available or associational information. the purpose of this paper is to employ these behavioral perspectives in an empirical model regarding the january anomaly to explore investor behavior in taiwanese stock market with bonus culture and well-known electronics industry. design/methodology/approach: this study uses the conventional and standard dummy variable regression model, as employed in prior studies, and further includes some control variables for firm, industry and macro-economic level factors. moreover, 19 industrial indices for taiwanese stock market over the period january 1990 to december 2014 are included in this study to examine the hypotheses, except for the 1997 asian financial crisis and the global financial crisis period of 2007-2009 to avoid the potential effect. on the other hand, the authors also use the entire sample period of 1990-2014 for understanding whether the magnitude of january effect is different. findings: the empirical results indicate that chinese bonus payments in january induce a strong january effect in the taiwanese stock market, especially when most listed firms have positive earnings growth in the preceding year, suggesting a house money effect. moreover, this study further provides some preliminary evidence that the higher january returns due to bonus culture are apparent only in the electronics industry when both chinese new year and bonus payments are in january, implying the role of availability heuristic based on the electronics stocks in investor behavior before the impending stock exchange holidays. some robust tests show qualitative support. research limitations/implications: the major contribution of this study is to extend the existing research by incorporating cultural and industrial factors with behavioral finance, thus enriching the literature on the causes of seasonality for asian stock markets. practical implications: this study also has behavioral implications of investments for investors in the taiwanese stock market, especially for foreign institutional investors which pay close attention to this market. originality/value: this study first applies and examines the culture bonus hypothesis with regard to how employees who receive culture bonuses in january can change their attitudes toward risk and induce the january effect from the concept of mental accounting. moreover, this study further proposes and examines the extended culture bonus hypothesis related to how the january effect due to culture bonus is different for the electronics and non-electronics industries when taking into account the stock market holidays from the concept of availability heuristic. © 2017, © emerald publishing limited."
"purpose: the purpose of this paper is to apply the strategic human resource management (hrm) perspective to investigate the schematic relationship between the dimensions of human resource (hr) capital information and intentions to use such information in individual investors’ decisions relating to investing equities in the banking industry. design/methodology/approach: a two-stage empirical study was conducted in 2010 using a four-part hr capital disclosure questionnaire, which was developed and validated in stage 1 (n=145) of the study. in stage 2 (n=157), current or previous shareholders in one of the australian banking sector corporations participated in the study. the collected data were analyzed using confirmatory factor and logistic regression analyses. findings: the findings of this explorative study highlight that the individual investors’ perception on the importance of performance management dimension of hr capital information has varied impacts on their intentions to use such information in investment decisions to buy, hold on to, or sell stocks. practical implications: this study has made an important contribution to the strategic hrm and behavioral finance literature that the human capital information facilitates the propensity to avoid regrets in selling shares too early (dispositional effect bias) to achieve utility benefits in future which is different from the findings of financial information disclosure study. originality/value: a recent critical review of hr disclosure indicated that most of the published articles on hr capital have used company annual reports for data source. however, this is the first study that attempts to understand the impact of hr capital disclosure information on investment intentions from individual investors’ schema rather than drawing data from company annual reports. © 2017, © emerald publishing limited."
"purpose: this paper aims to explore the relevance of bounded rationality to the practice of institutional investors in malaysia. understanding institutional investor behavior is important, as it can determine the asset prices and consequently the market behavior. design/methodology/approach: a set of questionnaires is used to solicit information regarding the understanding and practical application of behavioral finance theories and strategies among fund managers in the malaysian investment management practice. in the process, bounded rational theory is aimed to be validated. fund managers’ possible bounded rational behavior is assessed with reference to their investment management approaches and strategies right from individual beliefs and acquisition of information, as well as investment management and strategies used. findings: the findings lend support to the notion that institutional investors too, being normal human beings, are expected to think and behave in a boundedly rational manner as postulated in bounded rational theory. the sources of bounded rationality are individual, institutional and social forces. thus, portfolio trading and investment management strategies are exposed to wide varieties of behavioral risks. despite the notions that behavioral risks are real and the impact on fund performance could be pervasive, fund managers’ self-awareness regarding control and institutional readiness to govern behavioral risks in investment practices is still low. research limitations/implications: empirical evidence drawn in the current paper is subjected to small sample size and specific focus on malaysian context. despite this limitation, the sample is statistically sufficient and provides a fair representation, as well as quality opinions, of fund manager’s investment management behavior in malaysia. this research provides valuable implications to practitioners (fund managers) and regulators (investment management and capital market policymakers). in practice, the current study draws some practical ideas, especially for buy-side institutional investors, on the source and impact of behavioral biases on fund management practices and performance. for regulators, this research highlighted the needs and possible ways to regulate these behavioral risks. originality/value: the current paper provides new insights on the theory and practice of the institutional investor. in theory, this research provides evidence of bounded rationality of institutional investor behavior, practicing in the asset management industry in the emerging markets of malaysia. this evidence lends support to the validity of the bounded rationality theory in explaining institutional investor behavior. in practice, thisresearch provides new insights on the relevance of behavioral finance perspectives and strategies in the asset management industry practice and policy. © 2017, © emerald publishing limited."
"background context whiplash-associated disorders (wad) and neck pain and associated disorders (nad) are prevalent conditions that impact society and impose a significant economic burden on health-care systems. health economic evidence on wad and nad interventions has been sparse: only three economic evaluations of interventions for nad were identified by the bone and joint decade 2000–2010 task force on neck pain and its associated disorders (nptf). an updated overview is needed to inform health-care policy and guidelines. purpose this study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of interventions for grades i–iii wad and nad in children and adults. study design systematic review of health economic literature, best-evidence synthesis. methods we systematically searched cinahl, the cochrane economic databases (health technology assessment, nhs economic evaluation database), econlit, embase, medline, psycinfo, and tufts cea registry from 2000 to 2015 for economic evaluations of wad and nad interventions. we appraised relevant evaluations using the scottish intercollegiate guidelines network methodology criteria for economic evaluations. we extracted data, including mean costs (standardized to 2013 canadian dollars [cad]) and quality-adjusted life years (qalys), from studies with adequate methodological quality. we recalculated cost-effectiveness statistics based on the standardized currency using a willingness-to-pay of cad $50,000 per additional qaly. funding was provided by the ministry of finance. results our search identified 1,616 citations. six studies fulfilled our selection criteria, including three studies previously reviewed by the nptf. structured education appears cost-effective for adults with wad. for adults with nad, acupuncture added to routine medical care; manual therapy; multimodal care that includes manual therapy; advice and exercise; and psychological care using cognitive-behavioral therapy appear cost-effective. in contrast, adding manual therapy or diathermy to advice and exercise; multimodal care by a physiotherapist or physician; and behavioral-graded activity do not appear cost-effective for adults with nad. conclusions our review adds to the findings of the nptf. recent evidence suggests that structured education is cost-effective for wad, whereas advice and exercise and multimodal care that include manual therapy are cost-effective for nad. obtaining more robust health economic evidence for non-invasive interventions for wad and nad in children and adults remains an essential research priority. © 2015 elsevier inc."
"stock market is definitely one of the common choices for investment throughout the world. stock market index is well known as the composite of several representative stocks and reflects the trends of future stock market. predicting the change of stock market index becomes crucial for individual investor, companies and stock holders. recent research from behavioral finance implies that emotions of investors from social media can also influence stock market index in addition to the commonly used financial factors. taking the advantages from the development of modern network and the age of big data, we are able to obtain information from different sources. more specifically, accessing user data from social media is no longer a challenge. thus we apply data mining methods and propose to use the key words of emotions of market participates obtained from social media through text mining to predict the change of stock market index. compared with traditional methods, we are able to utilize full information from the social network. we apply the propose approach in a dataset collected from xueqiu forum, and the results show that linear discriminant analysis could give relatively good predictions of stock market index. © springer international publishing ag 2017."
"greater personal responsibility toward financial decision-making is being advocated on a global basis. individuals and households are encouraged to take a more active approach to personal finance. in this paper, we examine behavioral factors, which lead households toward savings and financial planning across a panel of 1253 dutch households. in line with the available literature, we find that an individual's propensity to save decreases with age and is higher among the financial literate. moreover, we find that saving behavior varies across generations, and is significantly dominant among baby boomers. this generation effect, however, weakens once we account for more individual specifics. our results offer evidence for parental influence, and for the effects of the psychological and behavioral metrics of numeracy, self-efficacy, locus of control and future orientation. a good understanding of these personality variables helps to explain why some take financial responsibility while others do not. © 2016 elsevier ltd"
"the authors' aim was to analyze the influence of analysts' recommendations on the activity of informed and uninformed traders and whether such influence produces changes in the price discovery process. the analysis was carried out in the spanish market, considered to be an ideal market given its characteristics. the authors' results indicate that although investors as a whole react to new information from analysts and their activity increases, this reaction is not independent of the type of stock. informed traders do not increase their activity with small stocks to the same extent as uninformed investors do. furthermore, the influence of these movements on price discovery is not significant. the results suggest that the interpretation role of analysts is more important for less accessible firms in terms of assessing their growth opportunities. this role may enhance the herding behavior of uninformed agents trading in those small titles for which they would otherwise need to invest extra time and extra money for taking profitable decisions. © 2016 the institute of behavioral finance."
"recently, investor sentiment measures have become one of the more widely examined areas in behavioral finance. they are capable of both explaining and forecasting stock returns. the purpose of this paper is to present a method, based on a combination of a naïve bayes classifier and the n-gram probabilistic language model, which can create a sentiment index for specific stocks and indices of the new york stock exchange. an economic useful proxy for investor sentiment is constructed from u.s. news articles mainly provided by the new york times. initially, a large amount of articles for ten big companies and indices is collected and processed, in order to be able to extract a sentiment score from each one of them. then, the classifier is trained from the positive, negative and neutral articles, so that it is possible afterwards to examine the sentiment of any unseen newspaper article, for any company or index. subsequently, the classification task is tested and validated for its accuracy and efficiency. the widely used baker and wurgler sentiment index [2] is used as a comparison measure for predicting stock returns. in a sample of s&p 500 index from 2004 to 2010 on monthly basis, it is shown that the new sentiment index created has, on average, twice the predictive ability of baker and wurgler’s index, for the existing time frame. © springer international publishing switzerland 2017."
"the applications of techniques from statistical (and classical) mechanics to model interesting problems in economics and finance have produced valuable results. the principal movement which has steered this research direction is known under the name of ‘econophysics’. in this paper, we illustrate and advance some of the findings that have been obtained by applying the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics to model human decision making under ‘uncertainty’ in behavioral economics and finance. starting from ellsberg's seminal article, decision making situations have been experimentally verified where the application of kolmogorovian probability in the formulation of expected utility is problematic. those probability measures which by necessity must situate themselves in hilbert space (such as ‘quantum probability’) enable a faithful representation of experimental data. we thus provide an explanation for the effectiveness of the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics in the modeling of human decision making. we want to be explicit though that we are not claiming that decision making has microscopic quantum mechanical features. © 2015 elsevier inc."
"big data benefits both internet finance and behavioral finance research; internet search frequency on stocks has been widely used to measure investor attention. in this study, we divide the search volume into news-driven and self-initiated by the online media coverage collected from baidu index. in a sample of csi 300 stocks from 2009 to 2013, we find that self-initiated (news-driven) search volume is more likely to generate buy (sell) pressure, and media coverage can negatively moderate the impact of search volume on stock prices, suggesting that distinguishing search environment for investors can help improve the measure for investor attention. © 2016 elsevier b.v."
"behavioral science in the field of finance and investment is among new topics raised in recent years. the relationship between financial sciences and other fields of social sciences such as financial psychology has caused researchers to do many researches regarding the behavior of investors in the financial markets and their reactions to different situations. based on the theories of financial behavior, shareholders' decision to buy and sell stocks is under the influence of internal and external psychological factors. through designing and experimental testing of the model of investors' financial behavior in the tehran stock exchange with an emphasis on brand, this study was an attempt to investigate the influence of these factors. to this end, financial, psychological and social factors were considered as the most important external factors influencing the behavior of investors and, considering the mediating role of brand awareness, their impact on perceived risk and perceived return as well as investment intention was tested. the research population consisted of all individual investors in the tehran stock exchange. in order to determine the sample size, considering unlimited population, cochran formula was used and hence the sample size was determined to be 145. for data collection, standard questionnaire was used. confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the reliability of the questionnaire and the research hypotheses were tested using path analysis. the results showed that psychological factors have a positive impact on perceived risk and returns. financial factors had a positive impact on perceived risk but no impact on perceived return. the impact of social factors on perceived risk and perceived return was not confirmed. moreover, the results showed that brand awareness has a moderating role in the relationship between social factors and perceived risk and return. however, its moderating role was not confirmed in the relationship between the psychological and financial factors and perceived risk and return. perceived risk had a positive effect on attitude toward the brand. however, the impact of perceived return on attitude toward the brand was not significant. finally, the attitude toward the brand had a positive effect on shareholders' investment intention."

"not enough is known about the responsiveness of individuals, in particular those who work under different incentives, to changes in marginal tax rates. we ask whether changes in tax rates are less distortionary for workers engaged in a contest. to examine this potential rationale for a more progressive tax code, we first model the effort decisions of workers faced with progressive taxation under tournaments and piece rates. because of the difficulty identifying any distortion that may be induced by the tax code in naturally occurring data, we then report on the results of a real-effort experiment based on this model. consistent with a behavioral approach to public finance, we find that competitive tournament workers are less sensitive and hint, in our discussion, at the possible welfare benefits of progressive taxation in tournament economies. © 2016 elsevier b.v."

"several approaches from the social and natural sciences take finance, and especially financial markets, as a domain of systematic inquiry. historians of economic thought have discussed extensively the emergence and evolution of some major, competing paradigms within finance, focusing on differences in their methodological and theoretical assumptions, as well as on the ways in which they have achieved dominant positions in the academia. however, how do these paradigms see the problem of their own value, in relationship to the value of their field of study? in other words, how do they present finance as a set of phenomena worth studying, and what is valuable about studying them from a particular angle? i examine here in this respect five significant scientific approaches to finance: financial economics, market microstructure, behavioral finance, social studies of science, and econophysics. i show how they represent the study of financial markets as a valuable, systematic endeavor, and how they represent their own value in providing a distinctive approach to the study of finance. i distinguish between internalistic and externalistic claims to value among these approaches. internalistic value claims make reference to data accuracy and to methodological adequacy, while externalistic claims make reference to investigating links between finance and other forms of social organization and institutions. © springer international publishing ag 2017."

"this paper explores how behavioral finance and complexity economics, along with imperfect information, faulty mental models and perverse incentive structures can cast light on the factors that generate the international capital flow surges and sudden stops that mckinnon described as the over-borrowing syndrome. while there has been a great deal of empirical research on this topic in recent years, there has been much less theoretical analysis of why these flows too often behave in such a volatile manner. developing a better understanding of the forces driving capital flows should help us identify situations where capital flow surges are particularly likely to end in costly sudden stops and help policy makers decide how best to respond to such flows. © 2016 world scientific publishing company."
"given the importance of non-economic considerations throughout the entrepreneurial life cycle, i aim to investigate the drivers of owner-managers’ ‘emotional pricing’ when they wish to sell their firms to successors. emotional pricing thereby denotes those elements of the owner-managers’ price expectations that cannot be traced to economic considerations. building on arguments from behavioral finance, i hypothesize that ‘emotional pricing’, which in this study reflects owner-managers’ willingness to sell the firm at a discount, is driven by the reluctance to lose access to information about the firm and to lose influence on the firm, and by an aversion to putting the firm’s future at risk. in particular, i argue that a long-term relationship between an owner-manager and a firm, a familiar relationship between an owner-manager and a successor, and situational contingencies – especially unsatisfactory firm performance – increase the owner-manager’s emotional-pricing component. i test the hypotheses using a sample of 1354 owner-managers of swiss small and medium-sized enterprises (smes), who provided their views on their exit intentions. i subsequently compare those results to 455 actual ownership transfers involving swiss smes. © 2016, © the author(s) 2016."
"rising population, income and urbanization are increasing urban passenger transport demand in india. energy and emissions intensities associated with conventional transport are no longer sustainable vis-a-vis energy security, air quality and climate change. cities are seeking transport roadmaps that jointly mitigate these risks. roadmaps vary across cities, but approach to delineate actions is common: (i) 'representative vision' that articulates long-term goals, (ii) methods for comparative scenarios assessment, and (iii) quantification of co-benefits to prioritize actions. this paper illustrates application of quantitative modeling to assess development and environmental co-benefits for ahmedabad city. the paper constructs two transport scenarios spanning till 2035. the bifurcating themes are: (i) business-as-usual (bau) and low carbon scenario (lcs). the quantitative assessment using extended snapshot (exss) model shows that transport activity shall result in four-fold increase in energy demand under bau from 2010 to 2035. three key contributors to co2 mitigation under lcs in merit order are: (i) fuel switch, including decarbonized electricity, (ii) modal shift, and (iii) substitution of travel demand. scenarios analysis shows that lcs improves energy security by reducing oil demand and also delivers air quality co-benefits - reducing 74% nox and 83% pm2.5 from the passenger transport sector compared to bau in 2035. finally, the paper argues that cities in developing countries can leverage carbon finance to develop sustainable and low carbon mobility plans that prevent adverse infrastructure and behavioral lock-ins and prompt low carbon development. © 2015 elsevier ltd."

"predicted to grow above 4.9 billion by 2030, with an overall spending capacity of $56 trillion, the rise of the middle class in emerging markets has attracted global practitioner and academic attention. how this new wealth will be invested is a central question; yet our understanding still remains fragmented. drawing on the literatures of international business, behavioral economics and finance and using high-frequency stock market data, we examine and map the trading behavior of the middle class in turkey, one of the fastest rising economic powers of the east. we find that middle class traders exhibit discernible differences to professionals, with respect to risk attitudes and stock preferences (e.g. prefer lower-risk, smaller-size and 'value' stocks). in addition, while they typically hold small portfolios and tend to realize lower gains than professionals, their role has become considerably influential to the direction of the entire market. © 2015 elsevier ltd."

"this paper presents an original essay that explains how managerial psychology affects the efficiency of transport firms. stochastic frontier analysis methods are applied to our sample over a 12-year period from 2000 to 2011, where we aim to detect the potential effect of a well-documented bias in behavioral economic and finance theory: the managerial optimism bias. we initiate a debate concerning the potential role of chief executive officers’ (ceo) irrationalities in explaining the inefficiency of public transport operators, such as the shortfall between the optimal production function and the observed production level. we find strong evidence of the negative impact of ceos’ optimism bias on transport firms’ technical efficiency, meaning that managerial optimism decreases transport firms’ technical efficiency. © 2014, springer-verlag berlin heidelberg."
"the gold standard in the sciences is uncovering causal relationships. a growing literature in economics utilizes field experiments as a methodology to establish causality between variables. taking lessons from the economics literature, this study provides an ""a-to-z"" description of how to conduct field experiments in accounting and finance. we begin by providing a user's guide into what a field experiment is, what behavioral parameters field experiments identify, and how to efficiently generate and analyze experimental data. we then provide a discussion of extant field experiments that touch on important issues in accounting and finance, and we also review areas that have ample opportunities for future field experimental explorations. we conclude that the time is ripe for field experimentation to deepen our understanding of important issues in accounting and finance. © 2016 the accounting research center at the university of chicago booth school of business."
"this short letter argues that insights from behavioral accounting are highly relevant for studies examining human aspects in finance. this is important because research focusing on the users of financial information and their characteristics often assumes that financial information in itself is neutral, unbiased and value-free. however, the information used by investors and capital markets participants for making economic decisions is prepared by accountants, who use their professional judgments by interpreting and applying accounting standards. © 2016 elsevier b.v.."

"the 2008-2009 global financial crisis and its subsequent ramifications on capital markets have led to an increasing attention on the importance of cognitive and behavioral issues in finance. the purpose of this study is to determine the ranking of the industry alternatives for portfolio investments based on individual investors' perceptions. accordingly, a hybrid analytic multi-criteria decision model (mcdm) - based on the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (fahp) and the fuzzy technique for the order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (ftopsis) methods along with sensitivity analysis - is developed to identify and rank-order the best performing industry options. the proposed model is applied to borsa istanbul stock exchange 100 index (bist 100) in turkey. the results indicate that (i) the investors' perceptions on market conditions and global financial situation influence their industry selection on company stocks; (ii) the investors' perceptions on portfolio investments rely heavily on performance and risk levels of individual asset/stocks, and (iii) traded stocks of financial industry (along with its sub-industries) have greater performance expectations than those of the ones in other industries such as technology, services and tourism. © 2016 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved."
"the transition to motherhood is stressful as it requires several important changes in family dynamics, finances, and working life, along with physical and psychological adjustments. this study aimed at determining whether some forms of coping might predict postpartum depressive symptomatology. a total of 1626 pregnant women participated in a multi-centric longitudinal study. different evaluations were performed 8 and 32 weeks after delivery. depression was assessed using the edinburgh postnatal depression scale (epds) and the structured diagnostic interview for genetic studies (digs). the brief coping orientation for problem experiences (cope) scale was used to measure coping strategies 2–3 days postpartum. some coping strategies differentiate between women with and without postpartum depression. a logistic regression analysis was used to explore the relationships between the predictors of coping strategies and major depression (according to dsm-iv criteria). in this model, the predictor variables during the first 32 weeks were self-distraction (or 1.18, 95 % ci 1.04–1.33), substance use (or 0.58, 95 % ci 0.35–0.97), and self-blame (or 1.18, 95 % ci 1.04–1.34). in healthy women with no psychiatric history, some passive coping strategies, both cognitive and behavioral, are predictors of depressive symptoms and postpartum depression and help differentiate between patients with and without depression. © 2015, springer-verlag wien."

"the link between measures of risk and return within the equity market has been very weak over the past 47 years. in the united states, returns on high-risk stocks have cumulatively fallen short of returns on low-risk stocks during a period when the equity market as a whole experienced high returns relative to treasury bills. the author takes seriously the idea that this evidence reflects a risk anomaly - a mispricing of risk for behavioral and institutional reasons - and revisits the associated implications for investing and corporate finance. the author examines asset allocation, high leverage in financial firms, and low leverage in industrial firms, as well as private equity, venture capital, and bank capital regulation along the way. © 2015 institutional investor llc. all rights reserved."
"non-professional investors face a series of complex decisions when considering environmental, social and governance (esg) issues for their investment activities. as such, this study sheds light on the question: what influences the use of sustainable information and the decision to invest in a sustainable company by non-professional investors? in order to answer the question, this article builds on the behavioral finance and information overload literature. we used an online survey carried out in germany and applied a structural equation model. the results show that the personal orientation toward sustainability issues is the most important factor in deciding to use a company’s sustainability information. furthermore, the study reveals that the decision to invest in a sustainable company is influenced by the personal sustainability orientation, identification induced by a good feeling, their willingness to waive returns for sustainability, their exposure to sustainability information, the investor’s age and information overload. the results show that non-professional investors do not distinguish between the different aspects of sustainability, that is, esg. the study contributes to research which explores decision-making of non-professional investors, specifically their perception of sustainability information. it identifies factors influencing the use of sustainability information and the decision to invest in sustainable companies. © 2016, © 2016 informa uk limited, trading as taylor & francis group."

"although international portfolio theory states that an optimal portfolio should be well diversified, in practice, investors tend to invest excessively in domestic assets. this tendency, which is commonly referred to in the finance literature as “home bias” (hb), has puzzled economists for many decades. this research develops and presents experiments designed to test the behavioral factors related to hb discussed in the literature. in particular, these experiments test whether the factors of “familiarity” and “fluency” (ease of pronunciation) affect hb. in addition, using a method of controlled experiments, we examine the willingness to take risk as a basic source of hb. we also examine hb under three different market conditions (normal, bear and bull markets). results indicate that subjects tended to take less risk with foreign, unfamiliar and nonfluent (difficult to pronounce) assets compared with local, familiar and fluent assets. this tendency increased significantly when the three factors were present together (foreign, unfamiliar and nonfluent assets) compared with when only one of the three factors was present. the results also revealed that hb increased during bear market periods. © 2016 the institute of behavioral finance."
"objectives: to determine the burnout effect on the quality of life of caregivers of people with dementia. methodology: systematic review of scientific articles that provide information on the quality of life and burnout of caregivers of people with dementia. the data sources used in this work are psycinfo, web of knowledge, scopus, pubmed and google schoolar. ten articles have been chosen with the selection and quality marked in table 1 and its main characteristics are found in table 2. results: have been grouped according to the statistics used in each study, the variables analyzed are those that reflect the relationship between caregiver burden and quality of life of caregivers of people with dementia. there is a negative and statistically significant correlation between burnout and quality of life. the quality of life depends on the burnout levels which in turn are related to the time they have caregivers for themselves, social support, behavioral problems of patients with dementia, self-esteem and finance. the health-related quality of life of the caregiver is inversely correlated with the level of dependence of subject and age of the caregiver. conclusions: a higher perception of burden involves a lower quality of life. so to improve the quality of life for caregivers of a person with dementia should influence the variables that affect caregiver burden."
"the behavioral finance view of anomalies suggests that mispricing stems from investor irrationality that could not easily be arbitraged away. we test the implications of this concept at the country level. this study examines whether market-wide measures of investor sentiment and arbitrage constraints affect the performance of cross-country stock market anomalies. thus, we first categorize and replicate at the country level a set of 50 parallels of stock-level anomalies documented in the academic literature. having determined 15 of them to be reliable and robust sources of return, we investigate their relationship to the limits on arbitrage and market-wide sentiment. we observe that variation in market sentiment plays an important role in returns on cross-country value strategies, whereas tight arbitrage conditions negatively influence momentum profits. © 2016 elsevier b.v."
"an extensive literature in economics and finance has documented home bias, the tendency that transactions are more likely to occur between parties in the same geographical area rather than outside. using data from a large online crowdfunding marketplace and employing a quasi-experimental design, we find evidence that home bias still exists in this virtual marketplace for financial products. furthermore, through a series of empirical tests, we show that rationality-based explanations cannot fully explain such behavior and that behavioral reasons at least partially drive this remarkable phenomenon. as crowdfunding becomes an alternative and increasingly appealing channel for financing, a better understanding of home bias in this new context provides important managerial, practical, and policy implications. ©2016 informs."
"from the aspect of behavioral finance, considering the loss aversion and fuzzy uncertainty of the asset mean return of investors, we research on distributional robust portfolio problem under the hypothesis that the distribution of asset return is unknown. we construct robust portfolio model based on loss aversion and ambiguity aversion character providing that mean return vector belongs to ellipsoidal uncertainty set. then, the optimal solution is derived which meets the worst possible distribution. furthermore, we empirically analyze the effect of dynamic loss aversion character and different degrees of initial loss aversion and ambiguity aversion on the model by use of numerical cases. the conclusions are that under both the ambiguity neutral and ambiguity averse conditions, active loss aversion investors outperform the conservative loss aversion investors from the aspect of optimal terminal wealth; the larger the loss aversion and ambiguity aversion coefficients are, the lower the optimal terminal wealth of investors would be. © 2016, editorial board of journal of systems engineering society of china. all right reserved."
"in this paper, we use data from the dcot report to test the usefulness of trader-position-based sentiment in explaining returns and volatility in 13 major futures markets. our main findings are that shifts in producer/merchant/processor/user sentiment are positively related to price volatility in the majority of the tested markets and tend to destabilize these markets, while shifts in money manager sentiment tend to stabilize futures markets by reducing market volatility. we further investigate the relevance of behavioral finance and noise trader theory in futures markets by allowing for asymmetry in the variance equation of the used egarch model. we find that producer/merchant/processor/user entities may behave like irrational investors and thus destabilize markets as they become bullish, while money managers may behave like rational traders and then tend to counterbalance price deviations from fundamental values caused by irrational trades. © 2016 elsevier b.v."
"a growing body of research and practical applications employ social media data as the proxy for a complex behavior of a society. this paper provides an overview of academic research related to a link between social media and capital markets. the theoretical rationale of this relationship is predominantly defined by behavioral finance. behavioral finance augments the standard model of efficient markets and considers less rational factors like investors' sentiment or public mood as influential for asset pricing and capital market volatility. in this context, social media is a novel tool enabling the collection of data about such less rational factors at the level of a society. the paper introduces social media data from a technical and economic point of view. in addition, it contributes to the theoretical construction of the transmission mechanism between social media and capital markets currently missing in the literature. subsequently, the paper summarizes the main findings in this field and outlines future challenges in this research. © 2016 elsevier b.v."
"this paper investigates behavioral biases among turkish individual stock investors during 2011. using transaction data, we analyze how common disposition effect, familiarity bias, representativeness heuristic, and status quo bias are, what factors affect these biases and how these biases relate to each other including overconfidence and return performance. we find that biases are common among investors. male, younger investors, investors with lower portfolio value, and investors in low income, low education regions exhibit more familiarity bias. female, older investors and investors with high portfolio values are more subject to disposition effect and representativeness heuristic. individuals in the opposite edge of overconfidence are subject to status quo bias. overconfidence is positively correlated with familiarity bias. representativeness heuristic deteriorates wealth while status quo bias results in higher trade performance. familiarity bias has a nonmonotonic effect on return; lower (higher) levels of familiarity bias have a negative (positive) effect on return. to the best of our knowledge, this is one of the few studies that focus on nationwide data and analyze the biases simultaneously. using a unique dataset, we extend the findings of the behavioral finance literature to emerging markets. besides, analysis of multiple biases helps us better understand the relationship among biases. © 2016."

"advertising for investment products has changed over the past 50 years. ads initially targeted investors as defined in standard finance: that is, as fact-seeking utility maximizers. ad portrayals gradually changed to target consumers, defined as people pursuing diverse life projects. verbal and factual appeals were supplanted by rhetorical, figurative, pictorial, and narrative appeals. standard finance views such advertising as problematic, because it may be deceitful and misleading. perspectives drawn from strategic marketing, in conjunction with behavioral finance, and also consumer culture theory, help to explain why mutual fund ads violate expectations from finance. a macromarketing perspective goes further, explaining investment advertising as a historically situated human action subject to social forces. finally, a societal marketing perspective uncovers moralistic underpinnings in the critique of mutual fund ads. © 2015, © the author(s) 2015."

"this paper examines how high-frequency trading decisions of individual investors are influenced by past price changes. specifically, we address the question as to whether decisions to open or close a position are different when investors already hold a position compared with when they do not. based on a unique data set from an electronic foreign exchange trading platform, oanda fxtrade, we find that investors' future order flow is (significantly) driven by past price movements and that these predictive patterns last up to several hours. this observation clearly shows that for high-frequency trading, investors rely on previous price movements in making future investment decisions.we provide clear evidence that market and limit orders flows are much more predictable if those orders are submitted to close an existing position than if they are used to open one. we interpret this finding as evidence for the existence of a monitoring effect, which has implications for theoretical market microstructure models and behavioral finance phenomena, such as the endowment effect. © 2015 taylor & francis. all rights reserved."
"this study combines the disciplines of behavioral finance and an extension of econophysics, namely the concepts and mathematical structure of quantum physics. we apply the formalism of quantum theory to model the dynamics of some correlated financial assets, where the proposed model can be potentially applied for developing a long-term prognosis of asset price formation. at the informational level, the asset price states interact with each other by the means of a ""financial bath"". the latter is composed of agents' expectations about the future developments of asset prices on the finance market, as well as financially important information from mass-media, society, and politicians. one of the essential behavioral factors leading to the quantum-like dynamics of asset prices is the irrationality of agents' expectations operating on the finance market. these expectations lead to a deeper type of uncertainty concerning the future price dynamics of the assets, than given by a classical probability theory, e.g., in the framework of the classical financial mathematics, which is based on the theory of stochastic processes. the quantum dimension of the uncertainty in price dynamics is expressed in the form of the price-states superposition and entanglement between the prices of the different financial assets. in our model, the resolution of this deep quantum uncertainty is mathematically captured with the aid of the quantum master equation (its quantum markov approximation). we illustrate our model of preparation of a future asset price prognosis by a numerical simulation, involving two correlated assets. their returns interact more intensively, than understood by a classical statistical correlation. the model predictions can be extended to more complex models to obtain price configuration for multiple assets and portfolios. © 2016 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved."
"in the past decade, financial markets have been hit twice by crisis, followed each time by recession (i.e., enron and the subprime mortgage crisis). i present three theories to explain the dynamics of share prices: rational expectations, behavioral finance, and an institution-oriented theory. institutional investors are the dominant actors on financial markets. they hold the majority of the share capital in big companies. they tend to drive financial markets to a higher level of risk (volatility). the greater the percentage of the share capital held by institutional investors in a company, the higher the volatility (variance) of the share price. the results of my multilevel analysis confirm this hypothesis (a sample of 1,369 firms in twenty-two oecd countries). there are also significant differences among the oecd countries. whereas both financial market crises originated in the united states, the country did not have the highest level of volatility in the period from 2000 to 2013. © 2016, journal of economic issues / association for evolutionary economics."
"this paper discusses the gambling contest introduced in seel and strack (2013, gambling in contests, journal of economic theory, 148(5), 2033–2048) and considers the impact of adding a penalty associated with failure to follow a winning strategy. the seel and strack model consists of n-agents each of whom privately observes a transient diffusion process and chooses when to stop it. the player with the highest stopped value wins the contest, and each player's objective is to maximize her probability of winning the contest. we give a new derivation of the results of seel and strack based on a lagrangian approach. moreover, we consider an extension of the problem to a behavioral finance context in the sense of regret theory. in particular, an agent is penalized when her chosen strategy does not win the contest, but there existed an alternative strategy that would have resulted in victory. © 2014 wiley periodicals, inc."
"risk and risk allocation have always been central issues in public utility regulation. unfortunately, the term ""risk"" can easily be misrepresented and misinterpreted, especially when disconnected from long-standing principles of corporate finance. this book provides those in the regulatory policy community with a basic theoretical and practical grounding in risk as it relates specifically to economic regulation in order to focus and elevate discourse about risk in the utility sector in the contemporary context of economic, technological, and regulatory change. this is not a ""how-to"" book with regard to calculating risks and returns but rather a resource that aims to improve understanding of the nature of risk. it draws from the fields of corporate finance, behavioral finance, and decision theory as well as the broader legal and economic theories that undergird institutional economics and the economic regulatory paradigm. we exist in a world of scarce resources and abundant uncertainties, the combination of which can exacerbate and distort our sense of risk. although there is understandable impulse to reduce risk, attempts to mitigate may be as likely to shift risk, and some measures might actually increase risk exposure. many of the concepts explored here apply not just to financial decisions, such as those by utility investors, but also to regulatory and utility decision-making in general. © 2016 michigan state university press. all rights reserved."
"purpose: this paper aims to investigate the impact of sources of information on trading behavior by analyzing the influence of investor personality in chinese futures market. design/methodology/approach: the authors adopted the big five personality framework and examined the survey results of individual investors (n = 333) in chinese futures market. personality traits of futures investors were measured by the neo-five factor inventory (costa and mccrae, 1989) which is a shortened version of revised neo personality inventory of the big five model (costa and mccrae, 1992). confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to assess the fitness of model. structural equation modeling was used to evaluate the moderating influence of investor personality traits on the association between source of information and trading behavior. findings: the results confirm the previous findings that the sources of information used by investors as a foundation of their financial choices have a significant impact on trading frequency. the authors also provide an empirical evidence that investor personality traits moderate the relationship between sources of information and trading behavior. financial advice from professionals is likely to increase trading frequency in investors with neuroticism and openness personality traits, and to reduce trading frequency in conscientious and extravert investors. similarly, financial information acquired via word-of-mouth communication results in more trading in extravert and agreeable investors. finally, information acquisition from specialized press causes more adjustment of conscientious investors’ portfolios. theoretical explanations, implications and recommendations for future research are discussed. originality/value: this study combines information search and behavioral finance literature to demonstrate that the impact of various sources of market information on asset allocation decisions is influenced by investor personality. no previous study has been conducted yet to explain variations in the impact of sources of information on trading behavior by the big five personality traits and this paper seeks to fill this gap in chinese futures market. © 2016, © emerald group publishing limited."
"purpose-i investigate the efficacy of adopting two mental aptitudes in the financial industry: mindfulness and compassion. methodology/approach-a conceptual link is drawn between the powerful mental acuteness obtained from practicing mindfulness (defined by jon kabat-zinn) and ruthless compassion (defined by chögyam trungpa rinpoché) and the pursuit of a noble purpose for finance, which is to channel resources into the most deserving social and/or economic activities that raise community and societal welfare. findings-these techniques allow decision-makers to reach new levels of awareness, giving them a competitive advantage for instance in terms of avoiding behavioral traps. making money remains an important byproduct of financial services, but not the overriding or sole criterion. an interview of solomon halpern, longstanding disciple of chögyam trungpa rinpoché, expert in buddhist meditation, and president of highlander wealth services, illustrates how these mental tools are applied for running a small us equity fund. research limitations/implications-the present study provides a starting point for further survey research on how these practices are becoming adopted in the industry. originality/value-this chapter is the first to analyze the impact of both ruthless compassion and mindfulness in the business of finance not only in terms of raised morality but also as an added tool to resolve informational asymetries proper to the finance business. © 2016 by emerald group publishing limitedall rights of reproduction in any form reserved."
"the securities and exchange commission (sec) mandates stock-listed companies in the u. s. to file regulated disclosures that should allow investors to make an informed decision before exercising ownership in stock. we thus hypothesize that investors do not rely solely upon the essential facts but are also impaired by unconscious and idiosyncratic characteristics in their perception. in fact, such affective processing is suggested by behavioral finance and information processing theory, while empirical evidence in large-scale settings remains rare. as a remedy, this paper statistically locates decisive words in financial news that reflect the complete bandwidth of drivers behind investment decisions. according to our results, the decision-making of investors is significantly influenced by emotionally-charged content and non-informative wording."
"purpose - this chapter discusses salient factors pertaining to the global financial crisis (gfc), also called the great recession, which gave rise to contagion effects that continue to reverberate across the global financial landscape. the gfc is linked to three primary negative themes: build-up of credit in a global credit super cycle, new financial architecture (nfa) and financialization under neoliberalism, and a distorted relationship between laissez-faire economics/finance and normative political imperatives. the conclusion is that we need to rethink understandings of key principles in economics and finance and reform governance mechanisms of the financial system. methodology/approach - the essay examines an empirical phenomenon - the gfc - and discusses themes based upon the author's insights gained from the vantage point of working in asset management during the crisis. in addition, the author draws upon material from the academic literature and financial press. he problematizes finance through the lens of the gfc and suggests that the three causal factors being highlighted are enduring sources of instability in the financial system. findings - the conclusion is that financial crises such as the gfc are not caused by unpredictable exogenous variables but instead pertain to identifiable recurring factors and human failures. structural, epistemological, and behavioral issues are aggravated by neoliberalism. finance is integral to economic activity. but under neoliberalism, the global financial economy rapidly assumed a particular form of financialization founded on market fundamentalism and political and regulatory capture. neo-liberal coöptation of finance, economics, and politics needs to be reversed to place financial and economic activity within more robust frameworks that take into account credit cycles, flaws, and instabilities inherent in the system while applying appropriate regulatory mechanisms to prevent crises. research implications - scholars and practitioners can draw upon claims made in this essay to propose more substantive reforms to the global financial system. these range from redesigning how finance and economics are understood and taught, to imposing circuit breakers to prevent credit cycles from becoming untenable bubbles. practical/social implication - neoliberalism is a political project that has distorted understanding of empirical truths while also effecting a paralysis with regard to fixing problems. the market fundamentalism that neoliberalism prescribes and promulgates results, time and time again, in financial crises that have disastrous consequences including massive wealth destruction. it is crucial to reform the system and create more sustainable, less volatile paradigms of financial and economic life. originality/value - arguments in this chapter are simple and straightforward but have significant implications for achieving more nuanced understandings of the financial system. claims are presented as distillations of how the system actually works, especially the way in which it tends toward conditions of crisis and stress. mainstream finance and economics are characterized as predicated upon certain erroneous propositions, particularly concerning efficient markets and rational agency, core tenets of the neo-liberal project. copyright © 2017 by emerald group publishing limited."
"administrative corruption in a simple definition is violation of a law for personal benefits by utilization of job position. it is a phenomenon within today's world as one of the most important obstacles on the way of societies' progress. the impact of different factors in forming corruption has given it a complicated nature. administrative corruption is a correlative issue and it is different according to value system of each society. this article is trying to present a solution in order to fight against administrative corruption through classification of staff with the help of explaining the relation of their perception, sensation and commitment towards corruption and corrupted situations. present study in terms of purpose is developmental-practical, and in terms of execution and based upon research purposes is a survey. the study population is the staff of ministry of economic affairs and finance in 2015. in order to explain perception, sensation and the behavior of staff, the questionnaire of administrative corruption is designed in three dimensions: perceptive aspect (cognitive) which includes items for assessing the status of awareness and recognition of staff from instances and consequences of administrative corruption; sensation aspect which includes items for assessing the vision and tendencies of staff towards corruption, and behavioral aspect which is formed from items for assessing the behavior of staff in facing with corruptive situations. in order to identify the reasons of corruption two questionnaires of ""national identity"" and ""organizational culture"" have been designed. the result of the research was that the perpetrators of corruption can be divided into three categories. first category is the staff that their perception is positive, it means that they have adequate cognition from manifestations and corruption consequences and their feeling about corruption is negative, it means that they consider it as an ominous phenomenon, but they are guilty of corruption. second category is the staff that their perception is positive, they don't see corruption as an ominous phenomenon. consequently, their feeling toward corruption is positive, and they perpetrate it. the third category is the staff whose perception is negative, their feeling is uncertain, and they perpetrate it. the behavior of these categories will be interpreted in form of related theories. the significant note is that despite the tendency average to practice administrative corruption among governmental staff is lower than assumed average and it indicates that there is a protection of corruption perpetration, but the rank of our country is not favorable the international organization report. this warning made the researchers to provide new solutions to help resolving this social issue by reviewing current solutions for prevention, and fighting against administrative corruption, regarding the richness of evaluating system in iran. © samieh darsareh, mehrdad bastanipour, 2016."

"analyses of users' digital footprints and online search history can provide valuable behavioral information. typically, online correlated searches for stock information can provide insights into revealing certain investor preferences and market phenomenon. prior research primarily focuses on mature stock markets such as those in the u.s. markets. the emerging chinese stock markets, which are characterized by unique investment features, are relatively unexplored. in this study, we explore the uniqueness of stock co-search networks in the chinese context and investigate whether we can identify some interesting investment patterns such as return comovement where returns of stocks within the same search clusters tend to move in the same direction. making use of network analysis, we construct search clusters from co-search data obtained from sina finance. we find some interesting behavioral patterns from online correlated searches. the empirical results provide evidence on the existence of within-cluster return comovement as well as a cluster-level factor that moderates return comovement in the context of the chinese stock markets. this research is of practical relevance for investors in an investment decision-making scenario. it also contributes to information systems (is) research in applying online correlated searches to revealing behavioral outcomes (i.e. return comovement) in an emerging market."
"most retail businesses operate in a non-contractual settings, and this relationship with the customers poses difficulties in differentiating between the customers who have attrited voluntarily and those who are in the middle of their long cycle transaction behavior. therefore, formulating an effective crm strategy in retail poses a significant challenge. this chapter proposes a dgp (data generating process)- based predictive strategy with the past purchase transaction data, which would help the business to improve the overall marketing performance with minimum data requirement. in contrast to many existing rfm (recency, frequency, and monetary value)-based models, a set of model with strong underlying behavioral model is proposed, thereby providing a greater insight into the customer decisions. the approach basically predicts a customer's future purchase money value by combining the three key transaction factors, viz. recency, frequency, and monetary value which is further combined into a more powerful single predicted value (prfm) for each customer. this represents an original contribution as many retailers are making decisions with rfm, but these are anchored on a static metric based on looking at past behavior and are not predictive in nature. furthermore, when they do try to render rfm predictive, the methods are often ad hoc, and therefore, they are usually difficult to implement in practice. the final and most important characteristic of this model is the extensibility. though the models depend only on three key customer attributes, r, f, and m, it can be easily extended to incorporate other customer attributes of interest by running the algorithm for each subsegment. suggestions for future research include the adaptation of these techniques to all types of general-purpose revolving credit cards which are being issued by most banks and consumer finance companies. © springer science+business media singapore 2016. all rights are reserved."
"in response to the demand for housing units which will cater to an increase in population, housing research in nigeria has generally benefitted from studies related to housing finance, mortgage, land acquisition, appropriate building materials and technology. comparatively less attention has been paid design and spatial requirements for future housing units, leading to the dearth of appropriate theories to inform future housing policies. this is an area academia through architecture education needs to adequately address. this paper explores the unique adequacy approach from construction management research through interdisciplinary methods from anthropology, sociology, behavioral studies and architecture in two stages. the approach was explored in tangale land, northeast nigeria to generate appropriate architectural theories and offer practical suggestions towards improving future housing policies. northeast nigeria is a region which has received little by way of intense architectural research in part due to mountainous terrain and a rise in insecurity and insurgency in the last four years. results from the first stage, an ethnographical survey reveals that external influences on the culture influenced the basic lifestyle of the community. architecturally, this is expressed in changing housing typologies. architecture conforms and reflects dynamic culture in a passive capacity. the second, a demographic and measured survey was instrumental in establishing the sustainability of cultural values in community-produced compounds. architecture serves as a mechanism of cultural resistance in an active capacity within the study area. an implication of findings from this paper is that architecture education plays an important role in training and equipping future architects to generate appropriate theories and data necessary to improve design and practice. this can be achieved through reviving awareness for original research during undergraduate training as well as pro-active interdisciplinary collaboration with allied disciplines of the built environment in postgraduate programs. © copyright 2016 iahs."
"returns predictability and cross autocorrelations is an important consideration in behavioral finance and is of considerable interest to investors and financial economists. this area gained much attention due to developments in behavioral finance during the last two decades. previously, lead-lag patterns were supported by argument of rational expectations, however, it lacked much empirical evidence. according to behaviorists' views, it is human inability to process all sorts of information and thus, information moves diffuse slowly from one market to another. in this study, we tested this slow diffusion of information using an extensive set of data over a period from 2004-2013. we found that the market was led by industry returns up to a period of four weeks. this predictive power of industries decreased as the prediction horizon increased. these findings are robust, even if we control for industry size and trading volume. thus, these findings add considerable support to the slow diffusion of information hypothesis."
"we suggest an original method of student cheating evaluation based on the comparison of students' grades in exams in class, home assignments and experimental homework. the data for the study is collected from the survey of 2012-2013 sophomores of the international college of economics and finance at the national research university higher school of economics in moscow, russia. at the end of the course in statistics in addition to standard assignments (homework and exams) students were given experimental homework with a ban on cooperation among them. the violation of this rule was qualified as cheating. the scale of cooperation is measured and then tested through the stochastic frontier technique; it reveals connection with the gpa level, students' expectations of the cheaters' share and students' moral norms. we also find different behavioral patterns for high and low performing students as well as country specific context of student cheating behavior."
"in order to promulgate effective consumer credit regulation, policy makers must understand the factors behind the supply of and demand for consumer credit as well as the economic and sociological benefits and detriments of consumer borrowing and lending. after an explanation of each of these factors and of the various types of consumer finance, this chapter suggests a regulatory approach that will reduce the damage but allow beneficial transactions to continue to occur. this inquiry includes the burgeoning field of behavioral economics which seeks insight into how and why individuals make the decisions we make. the chapter also sheds light on the macro and micro sociological and economic impacts of these choices. © springer international publishing switzerland 2016."
"this study empirically evaluates the pricing efficiency of several latin american exchange traded funds (etfs) regarding deviations of etf prices from their underlying net asset values (navs). a measure of these inefficiencies is made by implementing a trading strategy and running capm and fama-french regressions to determine the excess return of the trading. results do not conform to the efficient market hypothesis, but rather support aspects of behavioral finance. finally, it is addressed how these inefficiencies influence the decision for etf share creation and redemption via logit regression analyses. results highlight that etf authorized partners react to inefficiencies by trading within the etf primary market. © 2016, pontificia universidad javeriana. all rights reserved."
"purpose – the purpose of this paper is to systematically consolidate and analyze papers in behavioral finance in the past 20 years, and to provide an overall introduction to scholars and professionals in the industry who may be interested in behavioral finance in the future. design/methodology/approach – the research is based on searching keywords in databases of isi web of science (wos). survey data covers the period from 1995 to 2013, with 124 journals and 347 articles. the authors are committed to finding the number of publications and times cited in the field of behavioral finance to measure the contribution of active researchers. findings – more research papers in behavioral finance are emerging, making it a significant area of study. most of the papers can be classified as empirical or theory. the number of papers in the review class should be increased to assist scholars and professionals in understanding behavioral finance and its application. a number of personal and institutional main contributors have been making a considerable impact on the field of behavioral finance. with the vigorous development of financial markets all around the world, more and more scholars are becoming involved in behavioral finance research. research limitations/implications – articles published earlier than 1995 or not included in the wos database cannot be included in the research; however, this does not diminish the contribution of older scholars in any way. moreover, the research does not include non-sci/ssci articles. originality/value – unlike a traditional literature review, which classifies and elaborates different research paths (subrahmanyam, 2007), the research adopts the isi wos database as a tool for analysis. this new literature review methodology enables us to systematically consolidate and analyze papers in behavioral finance. © 2016, emerald group publishing limited."
"this study examines a measurement invariance of a second-order factor model of the behavioral biases in islamic banking and finance activities among muslims in malaysia. data elicited via a survey questionnaire was subjected to structural equation modeling analysis using the amos 23.0 software. the study revealed that behavioral biases as a second-order factor is indicated by herding, cognitive dissonance, anchoring, regret aversion and overconfidence of firstorder factors. measurement invariance was tested based on self-reported religiosity across a number of hierarchically structured invariance analysis models, including configural at the first-order level, metric, intercepts, and residuals at both the first-order and second-order levels. a significant variance was observed between the high and low self-reported religiosity groups. however, no difference was observed between the two groups and the 'moderate' self-reported religiosity groups. furthermore, based on the critical ratio score of statistical significance at alpha of 0.001, the latent mean difference tests of the second-order model indicates statistical significance across groups based on a path-by-path analysis."
"over the past several years, as the development of internet, social media websites such as twitter and weibo have received much attention due to their enormous users. a lot of research has been done on sentiment analysis and opinion mining in these websites. however the number of research on using the data in the social media websites to predict the stock market price movement is limited. behavioral economics and behavioral finance believe that public mood is correlated with economic indicators and financial decisions are significantly driven by emotions. this paper first presents a chinese emotion mining approach and discusses whether the public emotions or opinions in the chinese social media websites could be used to predict the stock market price in china. the experimental results demonstrate that the emotions automatically extracted from the large scale weibo posts represent the real public opinions about some special topics of the stock market in china. some public mood states extracted such as the ""happiness"" and ""disgust"" states are highly correlated with the change of stock price according to the granger causality analysis. finally, a nonlinear autoregressive model with exogenous sentiment inputs is proposed to predict the stock price movement. © 2016 - ios press and the authors."
"purpose: based on a thorough review and synthesis of the literature in behavioral finance, the purpose of this paper is to develop three measures of heuristics that tend to influence investment decisions of individual investors. design/methodology/approach: using perceptual data collected from a sample of 167 individual investors in the usa, the reliability and validity of heuristics measures are assessed by confirmatory factor analysis with structural equation modeling. then, the second-order model is executed in order to indicate the paths among the study’s constructs. finally, a multiple-group analysis is conducted to analyze the moderating effects of demographic factors on the relationship between the perceived level of heuristics and their constituent dimensions. findings: of the three groups of heuristics, salience is found to be the most important followed by mental accounting, while representativeness features as relatively less important. regarding the moderating effects, only investment experience is noted to have a significant moderating impact. research limitations/implications: the data utilized for testing and validating this instrument was acquired from a relatively small sample of individual investors in the usa, which makes the generalization of findings somewhat limited. practical implications: both researchers and practitioners in behavioral finance can use these measurement scales to better understand the impact of heuristics on individual investment decisions and also to develop models that relate the critical factors of heuristics to the performance of individual investment decisions. originality/value: to date, there has been no systematic attempt in the extant behavioral finance literature to develop a valid and reliable instrument on heuristics which would aid to improve the quality of decision making in investment analysis. © 2016, © emerald group publishing limited."
"objectives: the relevance of the article has been determined by the need to study the role of government in industrial modernization in terms of establishment of national design offices. methods/statistical analysis: the study of the industrial modernization causes, forms and financing was made on the basis of comparative analysis. irrational component of project selection was studied on the basis of the main provisions of behavioral finance theory, that in systemic terms provided the possibility to obtain an integrated assessment combining the investment views and the basic provisions of the theory of rational behavior. findings: the study of the market situation influence on decision-making regarding the technological development of industrial enterprises led to the conclusion that the biggest irrationality is related to the estimate of the timing of rapid growth or downward wave, when the majority of individuals make the specified time to fit for their own strategies, ignoring objective indicators of scientific and technological progress. analysis of reasons for the adoption of decisions on modernization, and features of its implementation, enabled to classify such decisions, which is necessary for the selection of modernization forms. a comparative analysis of utility maximization and choice alternatives when making decisions on industrial enterprise modernization made it possible to justify the need for descriptive rather than normative approach to modernization processes. the study of the behavior of the individual making decision on financing the modernization of industrial enterprises has shown that the traditional selection based on cost savings is not effective for modernization projects. application/improvements: the systemization of types and forms of industrial enterprise modernization has allowed proposing approaches and forms, countervailing the irrationality of the project selection, and practical recommendations for the national design office portfolio formation regarding the industry modernization."
"this unique volume presents new original research exploring factors that lead to investors behavioral biases. it discusses how features such as professionalism, sophistication, gender, media, and culture influence investors’ decision-making in general, and in particular, how they generate (or limit) behavioral and cognitive biases. the effects of these factors on capital markets are also discussed. the book is based on the discussions and presentations at the first israel behavioral finance conference, which took place in tel aviv in may 2015. it examines in greater detail some of the key issues discussed at the conference. this is an innovative book in behavioral finance: it is the first to present an extensive collection of papers which discuss a comprehensive array of factors that influence or define investor character and analyzes these factors’ effects on financial markets. the book is useful for readers interested in understanding the factors that influence investors’ profiles and thus their behavioral biases. the book will be of great interest to researchers and students seeking a reference book which contains timely research on these areas of behavioral finance. © 2017 by world scientific publishing co. pte. ltd."
"cross-border acquisitions play an important role in corporate strategic development and international expansion. during the past decades, mergers and acquisitions have been intensively researched through the lenses of strategic management, corporate finance, behavioral finance, etc. despite the intense effort, the progress made is still fragmented and lacks unifying theories that approach the entire acquisition process on the one hand, and in-depth research of critical factors on the other. the intent of the research paper is to establish a vital link between academic research and practice of mergers and acquisitions, especially regarding the pre-acquisition evaluation. in detail, the research paper investigates critical factors - and their inclusion in the pre-acquisition due diligence, before decision about acquisition is made. pre-acquisition due diligence theoretically conforms to organizational learning theory, which proposes the more the acquiring firm learns about the acquisition target, the higher the probability of a successful acquisition. the central hypothesis states that due diligence, including the critical factors, in the pre-acquisition phase is related to acquisition success. using a multidimensional measure of critical factors, the empirical evidence is based on 85 cross-border acquisitions that took place between 2007 and 2013 in the european automotive industry. the quantitative analysis finds positive association between the choice of strategic partner, business capabilities and hr knowledge, and financial factors and acquisition premium as critical factors of due diligence and acquisition success. the strongest relationship is between business capabilities and knowledge transfer as the main asset for realization of synergy values and successful acquisition. in this context, the valuation of the business capabilities of the acquisition targets is classified as the main challenge for reflecting suitability of the acquisition price and establishing value generation from the combined firms in the postacquisition phase. by studying acquisition risk and critical factors - both success and failure reasons - this research tested and proved theoretically sound framework for successful acquisition. from a practical standpoint, the research results provide acquisition management with a proven model for pre-evaluating acquisition candidates by means of comprehensive due diligence. copyright © 2017 by emerald group publishing limited all rights of reproduction in any form reserved."

"purpose – the purpose of this paper is to examine semi-strong market efficiency by observing the behavioral finance implications of jim cramer’s recommendations in bull vs bear markets. the authors extend the literature by analyzing investor reaction through the lenses of prospect theory, overreaction, and herding. design/methodology/approach – the authors test for abnormal returns in response to mad money buy and sell recommendations. the authors use a sample of buy and sell recommendations from madmoneyrecap.com from july 28, 2005 through february 9, 2009. the 3.5-year time period is the most recent and comprehensive set of mad money recommendations that has been tested to date. findings – the results indicate market inefficiency at the semi-strong level. furthermore, the findings highlight the loss aversion tendencies of investors in regards to prospect theory of kahneman and tversky (1979) as well as the disposition effect of shefrin and statman (1985). evidence also exists consistent with the herding and overreaction hypotheses. practical implications – the evidence suggests contrarian behavior in which investors respond positively to good news in bad times – perhaps, in effort to stay the course and at least break even. this behavior may suggest that losers tend to hold on to losses in hopes of recouping them. thus, positive information in bad times could further persuade market participants to hang on to or buy more of losers, while also persuading non-shareholders to buy in as well. originality/value – though other studies including kenny and johnson (2010) have estimated abnormal returns in response to analyst recommendations, to the knowledge, none has examined behavioral implications of investor reaction to buy and sell recommendations in both bull and bear markets. furthermore, the study captures a longer bull and bear market and covers two definitions of such markets. © 2016, emerald group publishing limited."
"government policies, marketing campaigns of banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions, and consumers’ protective actions all depend on assumptions about consumer financial behavior. unfortunately, many consumers have no or little knowledge of budgeting, financial products, and financial planning. it is therefore important that organizations and market authorities know why consumers spend, borrow, insure, invest, and save for their retirement - or why they do not. understanding consumer financial behavior provides a systemic economic and behavioral approach to the way people handle their finances. it discusses the different types of financial behaviors consumers may engage in and explores the psychological explanations for their behavior and choices. this exciting new book is essential reading for scholars of marketing, finance, and management; financial professionals; and consumer policy makers. © w. fred van raaij 2016."
"guided by a proactive coping theory, this online, cross-sectional study examined whether income, savings, debt service-to-income ratio, reluctance to think about finances, locus of control, and financial management competency were related to financial wellness. based on data from a united states sample (n = 1,039), results of hierarchical regressions indicated that financial management competency, internal locus of control, and savings were positively associated with financial wellness, explaining 43.5% of the 'variance. results suggest that, rather than resources themselves, resource allocation and perceived usefulness of financial actions are most critical to financial wellness. educators and practitioners can emphasize proactive coping through behavioral approaches to financial management that foster greater internal locus of control and financial wellness. © 2016 association for financial counseling and planning education®."

"whether the online social media,like twitter or its variant weibo,can be a convincing proxy to predict the stock market has been debated for years,especially for china. however,as the traditional theory in behavioral finance states,the individual emotions can influence decision-makings of investors,so it is reasonable to further explore this controversial topic from the perspective of online emotions,which is richly carried by massive tweets in social media. surprisingly,through thorough study on over 10 million stock-relevant tweets fromweibo,both correlation analysis and causality test demonstrate that five attributes of the stock market in china can be competently predicted by various online emotions,like disgust,joy,sadness and fear. specifically,the presented model significantly outperforms the baseline solutions on predicting five attributes of the stock market under the k-means discretization.we also employ this model in the scenario of realistic online application and its performance is further testified. © springer international publishing ag 2016."
"in this paper, the authors provide an explanation of the abnormal behavior of gold returns between the 1st of january 2008 and the 31st of december 2013. the authors suggest a behavioral finance foundation to the fact that gold returns exceed those of a wide range of other assets over this period. the approach rests on the safe haven (sh) motif for flights to gold during heavy financial stress periods. the prevailing baur-lucey-mcdermott paradigm on gold as a sh is shown to be insufficient, as it ignores the roles of volatility and risk preferences. the auhors suggest a formal sh definition, recovering those elements from behavioral finance. contrary to the previous paradigm, the approach is data-consistent, in the sample period. the authors find that gold is a sh for all stock markets considered, some exchange rates, and even euro area sovereign bonds (including german bunds). they estimate the sh risk premium in all cases. the authors find that investors perceive the distinction between good and bad volatility, and that they do not ask for excess returns when gold volatility is high for sh reasons. this is consistent with the literature on the low frequency of idiosyncratic shocks in the gold market. furthermore, the authors find evidence that, in a period of high financial uncertainty, fund managers building portfolios consisting only of gold might be acting rationally, contrary to the finance common sense for normal periods. in fact, in the sample period, gold is even strictly dominant in mean-variance terms, when compared to equity. © maria alberta oliveira, carlos santos, 2016."

"behavioral economics and behavioral finance believe that public mood is correlated with economic indicators and financial decisions are significantly driven by emotions. a growing body of research has examined the correlation between stock market and social media public mood state. however most research is conducted on english social media websites, the number of research on how public mood states in chinese social media websites affect the stock market in china is limited. this paper first summarizes the previous research on text mining and social media sentiment analysis. after that, we investigate whether measurements of collective public mood states derived from weibo which is a social media website similar as twitter but most posts are written in chinese are correlated to the stock market price in china. we use a novel chinese mood extracting method using two nlp (natural language processing) tools: jieba and chinese emotion words ontology to analyze the text content of daily weibo posts. a granger causality analysis is then used to investigate the hypothesis that the extracted public mood or emotion states are predictive of the stock price movement in china. our experimental results indicate that some public mood dimensions such as “happiness” and “disgust” are highly correlated with the change of stock price and we can use them to forecast the price movement. © springer international publishing switzerland 2016."
"in his celebrated work, arrow (1974) was the first to discover the optimality of deductible insurance under the expected utility theory; recently, kaluszka and okolewski (2008) extended arrow's result by generalizing the premium constraint as a convex combination of the expected value and the supremum of an insurance indemnity, with single layer insurance as the optimal solution. nevertheless, the expected utility theory has constantly been criticized for its failure in capturing the actual human decision making, and its shortcoming motivates the recent development of behavioral economics and finance, such as the disappointment theory; this theory was first developed by (1) bell (1985), and loomes and sugden (1986), that can successfully explain the allais paradox. their theory was later enhanced to the (2) disappointment aversion theory by gul (1991), and then (3) disappointment theory without prior expectation by cillo and delquié (2006). in our present paper, we extend the problem studied by kaluszka and okolewski (2008) over the three mentioned disappointment models, while the solutions are still absent in the literature. we also conclude with the uniform optimality of the class of single layer indemnities in all these models. © 2015 elsevier b.v."

"purpose – the purpose of this paper is to unravel the root causes as to why the boardroom independence–corporate performance linkage remains an elusive conundrum in the academic literature, and to propose practical recommendations for future research endeavors. design/methodology/approach – the probing of the underlying issues is made via an extensive review of the existing literature. a thoughtful analysis is conducted from a multi-disciplinary perspective by soliciting feedback from academics with corporate governance expertise in finance, accounting, economy, strategy, management and organizational behavior. findings – the lack of consensus on the economic value of an independent boardroom is attributed to three reasons. the first reason is ontological complexities inherent to the very nature of the corporation. the second reason is methodological complexities intrinsic to normative research with large archival data. the third reason is self-serving behavioral motive that cannot be factored in archival data. research limitations/implications – the infusion of complementary methodologies to the existing empirical dogmatism would provide the framework for a better understanding of corporate governance challenges and opportunities, particularly as it relates to making causal inferences on boardroom independence and corporate performance. practical implications – new insights on boardroom independence would directly influence corporate practices. social implications – the determination as to what constitutes optimum boardroom configuration has emerged as an issue of considerable importance to shareholders, policymakers and other stakeholders. originality/value – virtually no studies have been conducted in a comprehensive and systematic manner addressing the fundamental question as to why research pertaining to boardroom independence–corporate performance has not yielded unequivocal results in the relevant academic literature, thus the originality and value of this research. © 2015, emerald group publishing limited."
"individuals may seek and read others' opinions or may want to interact with others after participating in virtual communities. information, opinions, and advice in virtual communities may drive individuals to make decisions. however, the value of information may vary from person to person. individuals with different perceptions and experiences may differently evaluate the same information. our study thus investigates how individuals process others' opinions on stock message boards for their investment decisions when they have different levels of investment returns. the actual gain/loss of wealth may influence investors' information processing behaviors. the behavioral finance literature argues that self-attribution bias influences an investor's learning process. the self-attribution bias suggests that investors who use others' opinions for their decisions may lower the usefulness of opinions when losing money but increase opinions' investment-related abilities when making a profit from investments. in the context of online stock message boards, we investigate the influence of information valuation in virtual communities and start with an exploration of how they attribute their success or failure to either themselves or other investors on stock message boards. unlike other studies of continuous intention to use a virtual community, we consider the two paths using the factors of the online stock message board itself and individual factors for continuous intention to use the online stock message board. thus, our research is related to the information system literature and the finance literature. © 2015 copyright held by the owner/author(s). publication rights licensed to acm."
"our study adds to the literature by providing initial evidence on the interaction between short-horizon return predictability and investors' sentiment by traders' types on us commodity futures market. we find that the short-term contrarian profit is more associated with an increase rather than a decrease in hedgers' sentiment. however, the interaction between lagged return and past change in speculators' sentiment illustrates that the short-term contrarian profit is more associated with a decrease rather than an increase in sentiment. based on behavioral finance theories, we conclude that hedgers behave like irrational traders while speculators behave like rational ones. using chou et al. (2007) decomposition, our results confirm the obtained relations between change in trader's sentiment and the overreaction. by expanding this decomposition, we find that the winners' portfolio tends to more overreact with futures specific information. also, the cross-autocorrelation between winners and losers and between losers and winners can represent another source of contrarian profits. © 2015 elsevier b.v."
"deepening, extending, and more fully integrating the study of developmental psychopathology, school effects, and school adaptation is the goal of this chapter. the chapter first outlines the mutual interests of developmental psychopathologists and educators and points out theoretical and practice gains that could be the result of strategic exploitation of these interests. it discusses conceptual barriers to interdisciplinarity between developmental psychopathology and education and suggests an alternative, integrative perspective. next, the chapter presents a model of schooling and the factors related to school effects and adaptation. finally, it identifies integrative conclusions and future directions for further work. structural features such as finances and policies related to staffing and size; process features such as classroom qualities and supports, child-teacher relationships, and peer relations; and transitional points and shifts all intersect with the trajectories of children's social and behavioral adaptation both directly and indirectly as they affect academic and cognitive functioning. © 2006 john wiley & sons, inc. all rights reserved."
"background: compared with the fixed-price mechanism, the bookbuilding mechanism has not changed the chinese ipo high underpricing. how to develop scientific and reasonable ipo pricing, and reduce the high ipo underpricing has become a major challenge for china's securities market. methods: in this paper, using behavioral finance theory and game theory, we build the initial public offering (ipo) pricing and underpricing models with investors’ heterogeneity based on different issuing mechanisms and provide a comparative analysis. results: firstly, our models show that ipo underpricing will not be eliminated by using either fixed-price or bookbuilding mechanisms, but when the investors’ heterogeneity expectation is the same, lower ipo underpricing can be obtained by the issuing of bookbuilding compared with that of fixed price. secondly, the ipo underpricing may be larger than that under fixed price if the heterogeneity of investors under bookbuilding is larger than that under fixed price. thirdly, the numerical analysis results provide strong support for our model. conclusions: these findings further explains the cause of the high ipo underpricing long-standing in china. © 2015, zhang et al."
"this paper takes 533 operational risk loss events publicly announced by chinese commercial banks in the period of 1995-2012 as the sample, using peaks over threshold (pot) model to quantify the operational risk. the statistical data classification indicates the internal fraud is the main type of operational risk in chinese commercial banks. this paper explains its causes from the perspective of behavioral finance. the results are as follows: first, chinese commercial banks' operational risk loss events show an upward trend, then downward trend beginning in 2003 and currently an upward trend again; second, through the empirical analysis, this paper simulates the extreme value distribution function, finds the optimal threshold, and calculates the var and es of the operational risk of chinese commercial banks and compare them at different confidence levels; and third, in view of behavioral finance theory, overconfidence and loss aversion contribute to high internal fraud incidence. © 2015 elsevier inc."
"momentum has remained an unsettled anomaly in finance. in this paper, we examine the profitability of univariate and multivariate sorted momentum strategies based on prior returns, earnings surprises and revenue surprises using the data for 493 companies that form part of bombay stock exchange (bse) 500 index in india from january 2002 to june 2010. momentum profits are found to be persistent in the intermediate horizon (up to six months). price momentum winners provide higher returns vis-à-vis earnings and revenue momentum winners. on long-short basis, earnings momentum strategy is most profitable. earnings momentum is able to subsume price and revenue momentum. further, the informational content of revenue surprises is incrementally very small. triple sorted momentum portfolio using all the three criteria provides the highest return of 2.28% per month. the capital asset pricing model (capm) and the fama-french model fail to explain these returns. the post-holding analysis reveals strong overreaction patterns for both winners as well as losers, thus, supporting the behavioural explanation. momentum winners and losers perform better during market upturns. this study contributes to the asset pricing and behavioral finance literature especially for emerging markets such as india. © asian academy of management and penerbit universiti sains malaysia, 2015."

"while mainstream neoclassical finance ignores the role played by noise traders, a significant amount of empirical evidence is available to show that noise traders are active market participants and that their participation gives rise to market anomalies. unlike neoclassical finance, behavioral finance allows for market inefficiency on the grounds that market participants are subject to common human errors that arise from heuristics and biases. in this paper we review the literature on the behavior of noise traders and analyze the consequences of their presence in the market, starting with a distinction between neoclassical finance and behavioral finance. we identify the market anomalies that provide evidence for the tendency of markets to trade at irrational levels, demonstrate how noise trading is related to some market fundamentals, and describe the models used to quantify noise trader risk. © 2015 elsevier inc."
"given that the price limit hit is prominently displayed on the screen of the taiwan stock exchange (twse), we explore whether price limits occur in initial public offering (ipo) firms according to the assumption that the sentiments of investors tend to be aroused by firms issuing ipos and the price limit hit. results reveal that price limits often occur in ipo stocks. the above phenomena do not only occur during the ipo issuing year, but may also be extended to the following year. we infer that several ipo firms tend to manipulate share prices, especially for technology and high-underpricing ipo firms. the results of this study may be interpreted from the sentiments of investors via the viewpoint of behavioral finance. © 2015 the board of trustees of the university of illinois."
"older adults are a lucrative consumer market. in finance and health markets, considerable attention has been devoted to understanding their preferences and the factors that influence their decisions and behaviors. in a classical music concert context, older adults are extremely important; despite accounting for half of all attendees in most countries, little theory-based research explains classical music attendance in general and by these older adults in particular. using the model of goal directed behavior (mgb) as a foundation, we collected data from attendees and propose a revised model to capture the behavioral processes involved in the formation of positive word of mouth communication among these consumers. a modified version of the mgb predicted 57% of the variance in word of mouth and the model/data fit statistics were acceptable suggesting that the revised mgb is a robust and viable option when considering leisure behavior or engagement."
this study investigates the association between information acquisition and trading behavior by analyzing the influence of investor personality. we adopted the big five personality framework and examined the survey results of individual investors (n=333) in chinese futures market. results of this study indicated that information acquisition is directly proportional to trading frequency. we also add to the existing literature by providing empirical evidence that extraversion and conscientiousness positively moderate the relationship between information acquisition and trading frequency; and openness negatively moderates the relationship between information acquisition and trading frequency. this research combines both the information search literature and the behavioral finance literature to investigate that information acquisition that relates to asset allocation decisions is influenced by investor personality traits. © 2015 elsevier ltd.

"a series of stock prices typically shows a large trend and smaller fluctuations. these two parts are often studied together, as if parts of a single process; but they appear to be separately caused. in this paper, the two parts are analyzed separately, so that one does not distort the other, and some spurious interaction terms are avoided. this contributes a model, in which a wide range of features of stock price behavior are identified. with logarithms of stock prices, the two parts become of more comparable size. this is found to lead to a simpler additive model. on a logarithmic scale, the stock prices show the trend as a straight line (which can be extrapolated), with added fluctuations filling a narrow band. the trend and fluctuations are thus separated. the trend appears to be largely generated by a positive feedback process, describing investor behavior. the width of the fluctuation band does not grow with time, so positive feedback is not its cause. the movement of stock prices can be understood by analyzing the trend and fluctuations as separate processes; the latter considered as a stationary stochastic process with a scale factor. this analysis is applied to a historical dataset (s&p500 index of daily prices from february 1928). here, the fluctuations are autocorrelated over short time intervals; there is little structure, except for market crash periods, when variability increases. the slope of the trend showed some jumps, not predictable from price history. this approach to modeling describes many aspects of stock price behavior, which are usually discussed in behavioral finance. © 2015 world scientific publishing co."
"the benefit principle of public finance is regaining ground in the scientific and political arena. user-based financing for excludable public services plays an important role here. this becomes evident in the field of transport infrastructure for which a chronic underfunding has been claimed for a long time now in germany. however, road pricing policies introducing user charges for the first time face ubiquitous ""fee-resistance"" that expresses the unwillingness to see access to goods that were previously free of price obstacles now obstructed by individual payment obligations. thus, political involvement might turn out, from a public choice perspective, to be a real barrier to ppp projects in the case of user-charge financing rather than a driver as usually has been argued. for the case of transport infrastructure, missing political acceptance of road user charges and perceived lack of price fairness might be remedied though through an updating of reference prices determining the perceived fairness of market prices. thus, behavioral pricing might solve the dilemma of politicians trapped between the conventional tax resistance and the ""constitutional fee resistance"" occurring on the occasion of a transition of funding from general taxes towards specific road user charges. © springer international publishing switzerland 2016. all rights are reserved."

"motivated by insights from psychology, a growing body of behavioral finance research highlights the importance of investors’ attention constraints. collectively, this work suggests that time-series and cross-sectional variation in attention might not only materially affect the quality of market participants’ individual decision making, but eventually also matter for economic aggregates such as stock-level returns. while being notoriously difficult to measure, taking the role of human attention constraints into account might enable researchers to arrive at a better understanding of actual investor behavior as well as puzzling market phenomena, both of which are hard to reconcile with standard finance theory. against this background, the goal of this paper is twofold. first, and with a focus on empirical work, it aims at providing a (necessarily selective) review, assessment, and synthesis of the research on limited investor attention. second, it tries to identify gaps in the literature and to suggest fruitful directions for future research. © 2015, wirtschaftsuniversität wien, austria."
"in recent years, there has been rising interest in a field called behavioral finance, which incorporates psychological methods in analysing investor behavior. the aim of this chapter is to study the technical and the fundamental investing strategy of financial market participants dealing with assets. the motivation of the presented research is to simulate the financial market in the form of agent-based model and to investigate various impacts of risk and transaction costs on its stability. computational social science involves the use of agent based modeling and simulation to study complex social systems. it is related to a variety of other simulation techniques, including discrete event simulation and distributed artificial intelligence or multi-agent systems (mas). in practice, each agent has only partial knowledge of other agents and each agent makes its own decisions based on the partial knowledge about other agents in the system. for purposes of this chapter, a mas will be implemented as a simulation framework in jade development platform. the hypothesis was that transaction costs introduction will stabilize the financial market. the results obtained show that in the case of risk involvement into the system the hypothesis can be fulfilled only partially. © springer international publishing switzerland 2016."

"purpose – the purpose of this paper is to evaluate the profitability of investment strategies based on past price changes and trading volumes. design/methodology/approach – data are employed from january 1998 to december 2011 for select emerging markets. portfolios are formed on the basis of past information on prices and/or volumes. unrestricted and risk adjusted returns for sample portfolios are analyzed. the risk models employed in study are capital asset pricing model (capm), fama-french (f-f) model and fama-french augmented models. findings – price momentum patterns are observed for brazil, india, south africa and south korea, while there are reversals in indonesia and china. low-volume stocks outperform high-volume stocks for all sample countries except china. further, volume and price based bivariate strategies do a better job than univariate strategies in case of india, south africa and south korea. the past price and volume patterns in stock returns are not fully explained by capm as well as the f-f model. price and volume momentum factors do play a role in explaining some of these return patterns. finally, the unexplained returns seem to be an outcome of investor under or overreaction to past information. the sources of price and volume momentum seem to be partly risk based and partly behavioral. originality/value – the study analyzes combined role of price and volume in portfolio formation with post holding analysis. the work is useful for global portfolio managers, policy makers, market regulators and the academic community. the study contributes to asset pricing and behavioral finance literature for emerging markets. © 2015, emerald group publishing limited."
"this study examines strategic mortgage default on a neurological level. specifically, we test two mainstream behavioral finance/economic theories: sunk cost fallacy and cognitive dissonance. using fmri technology, we identify a number of substrates within the brain that provide a neurobiological explanation for why some homeowners exercise their mortgage put option while others do not. we find that borrowers rationally do not suffer from the sunk cost fallacy as it relates to strategic default in that they significantly prioritize their negative equity position over the amount of their initial down payment. we do, however, find neurological support that cognitive dissonance is relevant in homeowners’ thought processes as they toil with the hesitancy brought on by the believe that strategic default is immoral against the strong financial incentive to walk away from a substantially underwater mortgage. © 2014, springer science+business media new york."
"accurate information on how much the united states spends on public health is critical. these estimates affect planning efforts; reflect the value society places on the public health enterprise; and allows for the demonstration of cost-effectiveness of programs, policies, and services aimed at increasing population health. yet, at present, there are a limited number of sources of systematic public health finance data. each of these sources is collected in different ways, for different reasons, and so yields strikingly different results. this article aims to compare and contrast all 4 current national public health finance data sets, including data compiled by trust for america's health, the association of state and territorial health officials (astho), the national association of county and city health officials (naccho), and the census, which underlie the oft-cited national health expenditure account estimates of public health activity. in fy2008, astho estimates that state health agencies spent $24 billion ($94 per capita on average, median $79), while the census estimated all state governmental agencies including state health agencies spent $60 billion on public health ($200 per capita on average, median $166). census public health data suggest that local governments spent an average of $87 per capita (median $57), whereas naccho estimates that reporting lhds spent $64 per capita on average (median $36) in fy2008. we conclude that these estimates differ because the various organizations collect data using different means, data definitions, and inclusion/exclusion criteria-most notably around whether to include spending by all agencies versus a state/local health department, and whether behavioral health, disability, and some clinical care spending are included in estimates. alongside deeper analysis of presently underutilized census administrative data, we see harmonization efforts and the creation of a standardized expenditure reporting system as a way to meaningfully systematize reporting of public health spending and revenue. © 2016 wolters kluwer health, inc. unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited."
"nursing is known as a respected profession in society. nursing is also ranked as a leading career fostering unethical behavior amongst one another. historically, nurses are known to ""eat their young,"" meaning new graduate nurses may undergo a brief period of hazing conducted by the experienced nurse. in the past two decades, research demonstrates an increasing trend, often acceptable within an organization, of bullying, lateral violence and mobbing amongst nurses. this type of intentional repetitive harassment inflicts physical and psychological harm to nursing colleagues. it is important for nurses to be familiar with signs of bullying, feel confident in sharing the observation with leadership, and possess the knowledge to make an ethical decision. this type of aggression within an organization affects all employees, the organization's finances and reputation, and most importantly, the quality of patient care, all negatively. the culture of an organization reflects the leadership. transformational management style, open communication, behavioral expectations, policies and procedures, along with a zero-tolerance course of action for bullying behaviors, are necessary when developing a healthy workplace environment. laws and regulations in certain states are in place supporting healthy workplace environments. public awareness concerning bullying, mobbing, and harassment within the workplace has increased secondary to the media's publicity on the subject. nurses should reflect on the theoretical frameworks of the nursing profession and strive to role model virtues of integrity, ethics and civility within their personal and professional life. copyright © 2015 american society of plastic surgical nurses."

"in general, households use old technology for asset allocation decisions. targetrisk portfolio models are pervasive across the industry, and riskprofile questionnaires continue to form the foundation for strategic asset allocation decisionmaking. better technology would utilize liability relative optimization and a holistic balance sheet and incorporate behavioral finance considerations. however, these concepts have not been integrated into most practitioners' businesses, even though the core work on each was completed 20-30 years ago. the authors propose a scalable, total wealth model for integrating liability relative optimization into households' portfolios. the basis for the model is an asset segmentation approach that reflects the nuances of a households' balance sheet and future objectives and enables liability relative optimization and total wealth considerations to be applied appropriately. © 2015 institutional investor llc. all rights reserved."

"this paper studies the optimization problem with both investment and proportional reinsurance control under the assumption that the surplus process of an insurance entity is represented by a pure diffusion process. the company can buy proportional reinsurance and invest its surplus into a black-scholes risky asset and a risk free asset without restrictions. the authors define absolute ruin as that the liminf of the surplus process is negative infinity and propose absolute ruin minimization as the optimization scenario. applying the hjb method the authors obtain explicit expressions for the minimal absolute ruin function and the associated optimal investment strategy. the authors find that the minimal absolute ruin function here is convex, but not s-shaped investigated by luo and taksar (2011). and finally, from behavioral finance point of view, the authors come to the conclusion: it is the restrictions on investment that results in the kink of minimal absolute ruin function. © 2015, institute of systems science, academy of mathematics and systems science, cas and springer-verlag berlin heidelberg."
"introduction: to better understand the documented link between mindfulness and longevity, we examine the association between mindfulness and conscious avoidance of secondhand smoke (shs), as well as the association between mindfulness and physical activity. method: in shanghai university of finance and economics (sufe) we surveyed a convenience sample of 1516 college freshmen. we measured mindfulness, weekly physical activity, and conscious avoidance of secondhand smoke, along with demographic and behavioral covariates. we used a multilevel logistic regression to test the association between mindfulness and conscious avoidance of secondhand smoke, and used a tobit regression model to test the association between mindfulness and metabolic equivalent hours per week. in both models the home province of the student respondent was used as the cluster variable, and demographic and behavioral covariates, such as age, gender, smoking history, household registration status (urban vs. rural), the perceived smog frequency in their home towns, and the asthma diagnosis. results: the logistic regression of consciously avoiding shs shows that a higher level of mindfulness was associated with an increase in the odds ratio of conscious shs avoidance (logged odds: 0.22, standard error: 0.07, p < 0.01). the tobit regression shows that a higher level of mindfulness was associated with more metabolic equivalent hours per week (tobit coefficient: 4.09, standard error: 1.13, p < 0.001). discussion: this study is an innovative attempt to study the behavioral issue of secondhand smoke from the perspective of the potential victim, rather than the active smoker. the observed associational patterns here are consistent with previous findings that mindfulness is associated with healthier behaviors in obesity prevention and substance use. research designs with interventions are needed to test the causal link between mindfulness and these healthy behaviors. © 2015 by the authors; licensee mdpi, basel, switzerland."
"weather effect is a financial research field demonstrating that changes in weather conditions have an effect on asset yields. moreover, weather effect is one of the leading anomalies in behavioral finance and it has been checked by various tests for different countries and time zones in literature. in this study, whether weather effect anomaly exists in basic stock markets in turkey, belgium, france and greece was analyzed by using time varying bootstrap causality test. time varying bootstrap causality test is able to identify causality in time zones instead of presenting absolute judgments about series beyond the traditional tests. in the study, daily temperature, humidity and stock market data belonging to these 4 countries between 2001 and 2013 were used. the findings obtained indicate that weather effect anomaly is valid not in the entire data period but in some periods in the stock market. within this context, it was established that for all country wise stock markets, efficient market hypothesis is valid in some periods whereas weather effect which is one of behavioral finance anomalies also applies in some periods as well. © international economic society."
"models which consider behavioral aspects of the investors have attracted increasing interest in the finance and econophysics literature in the last years. different behavioral profiles (imitation, anti-imitation, indifference) were proposed for the investors, which take their decision based on their trust network (neighborhood). results from agent-based models have shown that most of the features observed in actual stock market indices can be replicated in simulations. here, we present a deeper investigation of an agent based model considering different network morphologies (regular, random, small-world) for the investors' trust network, in an attempt to answer the question raised in the title. we study the model by considering four scenarios for the investors and different initial conditions to analyze their influence in the stock market fluctuations. we have characterized the stationary limit for each scenario tested, focusing on the changes introduced when complex networks were used, and calculated the hurst exponent in some cases. simulations showed interesting results suggesting that the fluctuations of the stock market index are strongly affected by the network morphology, a remarkable result which we believe was never reported or predicted before. © 2014 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved."
"the first and only encyclopedia to focus on the economic and financial behaviors of consumers, investors, and organizations, including an exploration of how people make good-and bad-economic decisions. traditional economic theories speculate how and when people should spend money. but consumers don’t always behave as expected and often adopt strategies that might appear unorthodox yet are, at times, more effective than the rule prescribed by conventional wisdom. this groundbreaking text examines the ways in which people make financial decisions, whether it is because they are smart but atypical in their choices … or just irrational decision makers. a leading authority on behavioral economics, morris altman and more than 150 expert contributors delve into key concepts in behavioral economics, economic psychology, behavioral finance, neuroeconomics, experimental economics, and institutional economics to help inform economic models based on reality, not theory. through 250 informative entries, the book explores various aspects of the subject including decision making, economic analysis, and public policy. in addition to introducing concepts to readers new to the subject, the book sheds light on more advanced financial topics in a manner that is objective, comprehensive, and accessible. © 2015 by abc-clio, llc. all rights reserved."
"this chapter examines the applications of key concepts of behavioral finance within the context of the financial planning process. in financial planning, applications of behavioral finance are gaining acceptance in three major dimensions. first, an understanding of some of the key concepts of behavioral finance such as mental accounting, loss aversion, and decision heuristics can help financial planners in better understanding their clients. second, the example of the save more tomorrow program shows that beneficial knowledge from behavioral finance can be successfully integrated into practice to help people’s financial behavior be more consistent with their financial goals. third, research from emerging fields such as psychophysiological economics shows that in clinical settings reducing stress can help improve individual decision making. this holds promise for potential future possibilities when stress-reduction techniques can be integrated within the client communication process to further improve the outcome of financial planning recommendations for clients. © 2015 by certified financial planner board of standards, inc. all rights reserved."
"wavelet based multi-scale analysis of financial time series has attracted much attention, lately, from both the academia and practitioners from all around the world. the unceasing metamorphosis of the discipline of finance from its humble beginning as applied economics to the more sophisticated depiction as applied physics and applied psychology has revolutionized the way we perceive the market and its complexities. one such complexity is the presence of heterogeneous horizon agents in the market. in this context, we have performed a generous review of different aspects of horizon heterogeneity that has been successfully elucidated through the synergy between wavelet theory and finance. the evolution of wavelet has been succinctly delineated to bestow necessary information to the readers who are new to this field. the migration of wavelet into finance and its subsequent branching into different sub-divisions have been sketched. the pertinent literature on the impact of horizon heterogeneity on risk, asset pricing and inter-dependencies of the financial time series are explored. the significant contributions are collated and classified in accordance to their purpose and approach so that potential researcher and practitioners, interested in this subject, can be benefited. future research possibilities in the direction of ""agency cost mitigation"" and ""synergy between econophysics and behavioral finance in stock market forecasting"" are also suggested in the paper. © 2015 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved."

"real-world financial dynamics daily do challenge the credibility of the efficient market hypothesis, the pillar of the whole martingale-based modern financial theory stating that at any time asset prices discount all past information. as a matter of fact, the empirical evidence accumulated so far indicates that current models cannot explain the complexity of financial market movements, to the extent that a strand of skeptical thought, the behavioral finance, has been booming. the question whether a model exists which is able to make consistent the two paradigms is a living matter that financial markets demand to address. the paper deals with a parsimonious stochastic model able to include as special cases both market efficiency and ""psychological"" phenomena such as the underreaction and the overreaction, peculiar features of the behavioral finance. the great readability of the model, its capability to agree the controversial results provided by literature on efficient markets and the simplicity of the financial intuition it offers are discussed. © 2015 world scientific publishing company."
"although researchers have studied the annuity puzzle for years, it has only recently been analyzed from a behavioral finance standpoint. this paper adds to this new stream of literature by using experimental methods to investigate how market performance affects the decision to annuitize. using a large-scale, controlled laboratory experiment, this paper finds evidence that excessive extrapolation may be influencing this decision. in addition, we find that past market performance influences subsequent portfolio allocation decisions. this paper serves as a useful complement to recent studies using administrative data. our experimental approach allows us to more cleanly test the role of past market performance by carefully controlling for many factors that may confound the analysis of administrative data. © 2015, copyright © the institute of behavioral finance."
"behavioral economics is the combination of psychology and economics that investigates what happens in markets in which some of the agents display human limitations and complications. we begin with a preliminary question about relevance. does some combination of market forces, learning, and evolution render these human qualities irrelevant? no. because of limits of arbitrage, less than perfect agents survive and influence market outcomes. we then discuss three important ways in which humans deviate from the standard economic model. bounded rationality reflects the limited cognitive abilities that constrain human problem solving. bounded willpower captures the fact that people sometimes make choices that are not in their long-term interest. bounded self-interest incorporates the comforting fact that humans are often willing to sacrifice their own interests to help others. we then illustrate how these concepts can be applied in two settings: finance and savings. financial markets have greater arbitrage opportunities than other markets, so behavioral factors might be thought to be less important here, but we show that even here the limits of arbitrage create anomalies that the psychology of decision making helps to explain. since saving for retirement requires both complex calculations and willpower, behavioral factors are essential elements of any complete descriptive theory. © 2015 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved."
"existing empirical work looking at the effects of parental income on iq, schooling, wealth, race, and personality is only able to explain about half of the observed intergenerational income elasticity. this paper provides a possible behavioral explanation for this elasticity in which heterogeneous agents in sequential generations choose their education levels in the face of loss-averse preferences and weak borrowing constraints. these borrowing-constrained agents make education investment choices in part to avoid consumption losses rather than to maximize lifetime resources. the model generates a positive intergenerational income elasticity even when there are functioning capital markets to finance education investments. i find empirical support for the j-shape education decision rule generated by the model and show that it is mostly successful in matching the asymmetric intergenerational transition rates between income quintiles of white families. © 2013 taylor & francis."

"in the modern age of the digital world, gigantic amounts of data have been recorded or collected. it remains a great challenge to process and analyze the ""big data"". many neurophysiological, physiological, clinical and behavioral data are dynamic by the nature of the experiments or the way they are collected. these signals could be complex, noisy, and often multivariate and multimodal. how to develop efficient statistical methods to characterize these data and extract information that reveals underlying biological or physiological mechanisms remains an active and important research topic. in recent years, numerous advanced computational statistics, signal processing, and machine-learning methods have been developed and there is rapidly growing interest in applying these methods to data analysis in neuroscience, physiology and medicine. the state space model (ssm) is referred to a class of probabilistic graphical models (koller & friedman 2009), which describe the probabilistic dependence between the latent state variable and the observed measurement. the state or the measurement can be either continuous or discrete. the term ""state space"" originated in 1960s in the area of control engineering (kalman 1960). ssm provides a general framework for analyzing deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems that are measured or observed through a stochastic process. the ssm framework has been successfully applied in engineering, statistics, computer science and economics to solve a broad range of dynamical systems problems. the most celebrated examples of ssm include the linear dynamical system and the associated inference algorithm: kalman filter (kalman 1960), and the hidden markov model (hmm) (rabiner 1989). despite plenty of successful examples applying state space analyses to neural and clinical data, there remain many challenges in data analysis, for either developing new mathematical theories and statistical models, or developing efficient algorithms tuned for large-scale data sets, or catering for highly complex (multimodal or multiscale) and nonstationary data. in order to pave the way for further advancement in these research areas, it is important to recognize these challenges and exchange new ideas among researchers and practitioners. it is important to point out that the modeling and analysis principles discussed in this book are general and equally valuable for time series analyses in many other disciplines, such as climatology, politics, finance, chemical engineering, consumer marketing and computer networking. © cambridge university press 2015"
"the purpose of this chapter is to examine if even the simplest trading rules could take advantage of the market's inefficiency and lead to profitable trading decisions. for this reason, this study examined the profitability of the simplest trading rules, using only the simple moving averages (sma) rules that even an amateur investor could apply. in order to examine the specific issue a data sample from the greek stock market during the period 2002-12 was used. the results suggest that even if one takes into account the most expensive transaction fees, the trading rules signal profitable investment decisions; therefore, even an amateur trader and/or investor who does not have a significant amount of money to invest (which may lead to reduced transaction costs) could take advantage of the market's inefficiency. behavioral finance theories may provide some useful and alternative explanations regarding some of the reasons that contribute to the greek stock market's inefficient environment. © 2015, igi global. all rights reserved."
"this chapter introduces the role of psychological factors in behavioral finance, thus explaining the theory of behavioral finance, the application of behavioral finance theory, the empirical achievement in behavioral finance, the utilization of psychological factors in behavioral finance regarding beliefs (i.e., overconfidence, too much trading, optimism and wishful thinking, representativeness bias, conservatism bias, belief perseverance, anchoring, and availability bias) and preferences (i.e., prospect theory and ambiguity aversion). behavioral finance is a comparatively new management field that seeks to combine behavioral and cognitive psychological theory with conventional economics and finance to provide descriptions for why people make unreasonable financial decisions. psychological factors in behavioral finance hold out the expectation of a better understanding of financial market behavior and scope for investors to make better investment decisions. applying psychological factors in behavioral finance will tremendously enhance financial performance and achieve strategic objectives in global finance. © 2015, igi global. all rights reserved."

"the increasing prevalence of obesity together with projected increases in diabetes over the next 20-30 years will put a substantial strain on the finances and resources of the us healthcare system. the best opportunity for broad scale treatment of obesity may lie in the primary care setting. this review assesses the evidence on the efficacy of treatment for obesity delivered in primary care in the united states. it summarizes an earlier systematic review, recent obesity treatment guidelines, and subsequent us based trials with a minimum follow-up of six months in which at least one member of a primary care team helped deliver comprehensive behavioral obesity treatment to adults with overweight or obesity. overall, the evidence suggests that obesity treatment delivered in primary care has limited effectiveness. questions remain about the optimal role of the primary care provider in the treatment of obesity and the prevention of weight gain, as well as potential systems approaches to the treatment of obesity."
"purpose – recent studies in the field of behavioral finance have highlighted the importance of investor sentiment in the return-generating process for general equities. by employing an asset pricing framework, this paper aims to evaluate the performance of european real estate equities, based on their degree of sentiment sensitivity. design/methodology/approach – using a pan-european data set, we classify all real estate equities according to their sentiment sensitivity, which is measured relative to the economic sentiment indicator (esi) of the european commission. based on their individual sentiment responsiveness, we form both a high- and low-sensitivity portfolio, whose returns are included in the difference test of the liquidity-augmented asset pricing model. in this context, we analyze the performance of sentimentsensitive and sentiment-insensitive real estate equities with a risk-adjusted perspective over the period july 1995 to june 2012. findings – while high-sensitivity real estate equities yield significantly higher raw returns than those with low sensitivity, we find no evidence of risk-adjusted outperformance. this indicates that allegedly sentiment-driven return behavior is in fact merely compensation for taking higher fundamental risks. in this context, we find that sentiment sensitive real estate equities are exposed to significantly higher market risks than sentiment-insensitive ones. based on these findings, we conclude that a sentimentbased investment strategy, consisting of a long-position in the high sensitivity portfolio and a short-position in the low-sensitivity one, does not generate a risk-adjusted profit. research limitations/implications – although this study sheds some light on investor sentiment in european real estate stock markets, further research could usefully concentrate on alternative sentiment proxies. originality/value – this is the first study to disentangle the relationship between investor sentiment and european real estate stock returns. © 2015, emerald group publishing limited."
"behavioral finance depends intimately on the notion of subjective probability, which has been universally treated as one of the two forms of probability. a substantial body of work and recent experimental results show conclusively that this approach is invalid: subjective and objective probabilities cannot be treated as two sides of the same coin. this raises serious questions about calculations based on that assumption, decisions based on those calculations, and what to do if assigning numerical values and calculating expected values based on subjective probabilities is invalid. this paper presents a radical re-formulation of subjective probability, showing that what have been called “subjective probabilities” are properly formulated as uncertainty appraisals, re-descriptions of states of affairs carrying tautological implications for action. a novel formulation of the decision maker's field-of-view, based on the concept of actor, observer, and critic roles, combined with the uncertainty appraisal formulation, is used to develop new methods for evaluating data, finding patterns in data, and integrating probabilities and uncertainty appraisals, that is, those aspects that have, until now, been called “subjective probabilities.” © 2015, copyright © the institute of behavioral finance."
"in this essay, we reflect on difficulties that may constrain the achievement of substantive change in areas of public policy. our focus is the discipline of finance - as a field of practices and a field of research - in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. our exploratory analysis indicates difficulties in concretizing substantive change in both fields, although difficulties do not imply absolute inertia and structural inalterability. in particular, we found indications that, apart from a few exceptions, the core of finance research has largely failed to invest in the promotion of paradigmatic diversity, and continues to resist the idea. yet, the stakes involved are significant, since finance's lack of diversity in research paradigms arguably translates into a body of knowledge that presents important limitations when trying to make sense of important phenomena, not least of which are infrequent but highly significant events unfolding in the political economy. although we are aware of the underlying obstacles, we maintain that there is a need for finance academics to increase their commitment to research diversity and engage more thoroughly in the examination of finance in action. while the development of behavioral finance constitutes an interesting intellectual ramification, which allows the field to experiment in relaxing the assumption of investor rationality, a stronger engagement in diversifying knowledge, paradigmatically and methodologically, is needed for richer and grounded understandings of finance in action to concretize. © 2013 elsevier ltd."
"this paper investigates overconfidence among individual stock investors. we focus on turkey in order to use a unique nationwide dataset and study how common overconfidence is, what factors affect overconfidence and how overconfidence relates to investor return performance. our findings show that overconfident behavior is common among individual stock investors. male, younger investors, investors with a lower portfolio value, and investors in low income and low education regions exhibit more overconfident behavior. moreover, we find that overconfidence has a negative effect on portfolio wealth. to the best of our knowledge, our study is one of the few studies in the literature and the first in turkey focusing on nationwide data to analyze overconfidence. we extend the findings of the behavioral finance literature to the turkish market based on this dataset. © 2015 elsevier b.v."
"it is widely accepted that a large proportion of acquisition strategies fail to deliver the expected value. globalizing markets characterized by growing uncertainty, together with the advent of new competitors, are further complicating the task of valuing acquisitions. too often, managers rely on flawed valuation models or their intuition and experience when making risky investment decisions, exposing their companies to potentially costly pitfalls. playing at acquisitions provides managers with a powerful methodology for designing and executing successful acquisition strategies. the book tackles the myriad executive biases that infect decision making at every stage of the acquisition process, and the inadequacy of current valuation approaches to help mitigate these biases and more realistically represent value in uncertain environments. bringing together the latest advances in behavioral finance, real option valuation, and game theory, this unique playbook explains how to express acquisition strategies as sets of real options, explicitly introducing uncertainty and future optionality into acquisition strategy design. it shows how to incorporate the competitive dynamics that exist in different acquisition contexts, acknowledge and even embrace uncertainty, identify the value of the real options embedded in targets, and more. rooted in economic theory and featuring numerous real-world case studies, playing at acquisitions will enhance the ability of ceos and their teams to derive value from their acquisition strategies, and is also an ideal resource for researchers and mbas. © 2015 by han smit and thras moraitis. all rights reserved."

"purpose - a brief critical review of the existing literature on the topic of integrity opens up the scope for a detailed approach to the meaning of social integrity, or integrity in its social relational sense. the tenor of explanation of this concept is then taken up as a subspace of the meaning of the supreme good and therein the concept of goodness. the paper aims to discuss these issues. design/methodology/approach - all such concepts are studied in the relational sense of epistemic origin of values. such ethical values arise from the epistemic ontology of the moral law. they are contrasted with the contrary meanings under the episteme of rationalism. findings - rationalism as philosophy of mind and matter devoid of a substantive acceptance of the divinely inspired functional ontology of the moral law is also critically and formally studied. research limitations/implications - more empirical work needed and which indeed can be done both statistically as well as by quantitative mathematical models. the scope for this extension remains wide open in the paper. practical implications - the paper presents an immense import in the study of cognitive economics, behavioral finance, and decision making in the area of ethical finance and organizational behavior as a conscious institution. an example is provided. many more areas are indicated. altogether a vast scope of conception and applications in the area of endogenous ethics and socio-scientific field remains open. originality/value - the paper is truly original crossing the boundaries of social cybernetics and systems into mathematical algorithmic treatment exemplified by a game-theoretic example of the imminent place of the meanings of the good, goodness, and the trait of integrity in social behavior. all these are together embedded in the study of embedded social system and cybernetic study. this is a foundationally original field of research investigation playing out its analytical part in the study of social system and cybernetic. © emerald group publishing limited."

"one reason for unsatisfactory public service delivery in indian cities is that city finances are in poor condition. recent research shows that given the fragmented institutional arrangements for land in india's cities, there is a case for transferring revenues from land leasing and sales to cities. in this paper, the author determines whether such transfer of revenues to india's cities from the state governments is justified. the author uses stochastic frontier analysis to determine the efficiency of indian cities, taking the case of roads. the author has found india's cities to be highly efficient in the provision of roads and there is only one percent inefficiency in the provision of roads by city governments. hence transfer of finances to cities in a phased manner is recommended. thus this paper shows a direct link between behavioral economics and concrete, practical applications at the organizational level. © 2015, igi global."

"investors are rational, in the sense that they make decisions according to axioms of expected utility theory, they have stable preferences, and their forecasts about the future are unbiased. financial markets are effective given that nobody is able to systematically beat the market, and security prices reflect only utilitarian characteristics (see statman 1999a). these two assumptions of investors’ rationality and market efficiency have dominated, like a charm, the standard theory of finance. economic models of human behavior based on the two assumptions are simple and elegant, but more and more data show that they are incomplete or unrealistic. results from the growing field of behavioral finance, which applies psychology to economic models, seem to indicate neither that investors are rational nor that markets are effective (at least in the sense of prices’ rationality). the importance of psychosocial factors in economic interactions is also revealed in the experimental economists’ work on financial markets. smith showed, using experimental methods, that the behavior of individuals participating in trust games is sensitive to reciprocity (see smith 2000 for a review). this means that traders tend to accept a reciprocal exchange even if this is not rational from an economic point of view. © 2006 taylor & francis. all rights reserved."

"behavioral finance brings psychological and sociological considerations to bear on the analysis of financial decision-making. when considering decision-making, the behavioral influences can be classified as heuristic simplification, self-deception, affect, and social influence. this chapter explains and illustrates some of the behavioral finance concepts and shows their relevance to the practice of financial planning and advice. heuristic simplification becomes necessary because of bounded rationality, which is rationality that is limited by intellectual capacity. the heuristics produce psychological biases that appear to be universal and hard-wired into our brains. some have even been found in other primates, indicating a distant evolutionary origin. it has been suggested that there may be as many as 150 psychological biases arising from heuristic simplification. the chapter considers three applications of behavioral finance to decision making in relation to personal finance: portfolio evaluation, annuity purchase, and saving for retirement. © 2015 by certified financial planner board of standards, inc. all rights reserved."

"background: behavioral economics studies have found that individuals with more patient time preferences (ie, greater willingness to forgo current costs for future benefits) are more likely to save money. although research has observed significant relationships between time preferences and health-promoting behaviors, scant evidence exists with physical activity as an outcome. methods: we examined the association between monetary saving behaviors and physical activity among adults of low-income who reside in an urban community. specifically, we assessed the relationship between saving behaviors (checking/saving account, monthly savings, and planning family finances), and future orientation to physical activity as a dichotomous (meeting guidelines) and continuous (total and domain specific) endpoint. results: in multivariable regression, being future-oriented and having a checking/saving account were related to a 1.3 and 2.1 times higher (respectively) likelihood of meeting physical activity guidelines (p < .05). when examining physical activity continuously, all measures were significantly related to leisure-time activity (p < .05). conclusions: our study findings establish a relationship between future time preferences and increased levels of physical activity among low-income adults. future research should prospectively explore the efficacy of various schemes that help individuals overcome impatient time preferences to determine a causal relationship. © 2015 human kinetics, inc."
"in all aspects of financial planning, an understanding of both the client and planner’s attitudes, values, and biases is needed to effectively gather client information and communicate recommendations. the field of behavioral finance has provided insights and tools that aid in this process. the financial planner must be able to identify the client’s risk tolerance and be able to communicate effectively so as to keep the client’s risk perception aligned with reality. understanding a client’s learning style is crucially important for the financial planner when developing and communicating recommendations. it is also important when gathering information about goals, objectives, and preferences. a client’s cultural and religious background will often influence attitudes toward financial decisions as a consequence of varying beliefs related to such things as borrowing and debt or acceptable investment categories. cultural and religious background can also influence how competing financial goals are prioritized. © 2015 by certified financial planner board of standards, inc. all rights reserved."
"purpose – the purpose of this paper is to investigate how fund managers in a non-western country like malaysia follow investment processes developed in the west and taught in the finance departments of universities. design/methodology/approach – this convergent interview research investigates how fund managers in malaysia actually make their decisions, and develops a framework about their investment process. findings – understanding the economy was important for the managers but was an ongoing learning process. their analyses sometimes started bottom-up or top-down, but all followed a four-layer process. the managers did not believe the investment process could be quantified. research limitations/implications – convergent interviewing is meant to be a first step in a complete research program. so, future researchers could consider extending the research to different periods, different research settings in other countries like singapore, india or indonesia, different types of investors and different methodologies like surveys. practical implications – practitioners should build on their experience, and understand principles of behavioral finance. students in business schools should be taught in an experiential way, and school staff should use qualitative methods like convergent interviewing in their research projects. originality/value – contributions centre on the article’s behavioural finance findings that experience and non-quantitative methods are the core of malaysian investment managers’ decision-making, and on its detailed description of the unusual research methodology in finance of convergent interviewing. © 2015, © emerald group publishing limited."
"since the 2008 financial crisis, consumer regulators have closely supervised sellers of credit cards and home mortgages to stamp out anticompetitive practices. supervision programs give financial regulators ongoing access to sophisticated firms' internal data outside the litigation process. this often enables examiners to identify and correct harmful conduct more rapidly and effectively than would be possible using publicly available information and cumbersome legal tools. consumers spend four times more on retail goods than on financial products. the retail sector's dominant firms - such as amazon, walmart, unilever, and kraft-employ large teams of quantitative experts armed with advanced information technologies, huge volumes of data, and in-store experimentation to develop behavioral economics-related practices analogous to those seen in consumer finance. the empirical data suggest those practices in the aggregate may significantly harm all households, costing even a family at the poverty line hundreds of dollars annually. yet unlike in consumer finance, regulators have declined to supervise sellers of retail goods. this article argues for wider adoption of the financial sector's emerging - though largely unarticulated - paradigm that views regulatory supervision of firms as central to consumer protection. that paradigm suggests the consumer goods sector needs the inverse of what consumer finance needed in the wake of the 2008 crisis. then, congress created the consumer financial protection bureau to provide more consumer protection because regulators had previously focused excessively on supervising financial institutions to ensure firms' safety and soundness. in contrast, the consumer goods sector has a regulatory body - the federal trade commission's (ftc) bureau of consumer protection - that focuses solely on consumer protection but does not supervise firms. fortunately, congressional action would not be required for the ftc to develop a supervision program. the agency's leadership would simply need to exercise the authority that congress long ago granted. © 2015, university of pennsylvania law school. all rights reserved."
"connecting suicidal individuals to appropriate mental health care services is a key component of suicide prevention efforts. this review aims to critically discuss the extant literature on help-seeking and mental health service utilization among individuals at elevated risk for suicide, as well as to outline challenges and future directions for research in this area. across studies, the rate of mental health service use for those with past-year suicide ideation, plans, and/or attempts was approximately 29.5% based on weighted averages, with a lack of perceived need for services, preference for self-management, fear of hospitalization, and structural factors (e.g., time, finances) identified as key barriers to care. studies also revealed facilitators to care, which include mental health literacy, positive views of services, and encouragement from family or friends to seek support. to address these low rates of help-seeking and barriers to care, a number of interventions have been developed, including psychoeducation-based programs, peer and gatekeeper training, and screening-based approaches. despite these efforts, it appears that work is still needed to gauge the impact of these interventions on behavioral outcomes and to more rigorously test their effectiveness. additional implications for future research on help-seeking among suicidal individuals are discussed. © 2015 elsevier ltd."
"crowdfunded journalism is a new model for funding journalism in which reporters solicit micropayments from readers to finance their reporting. in the present study, we seek to identify the major motivations behind readers' donations to a pioneering crowdfunded journalism website, spot.us. under the theoretical framework of collective action, we explore a total of 9 motivations: altruism, fun, belief in freedom of content, social, community, self-esteem, understanding, image, and family and friends. combining self-reported survey data (n = 344) with behavioral data on readers' complete donation records obtained from the spot.us server, we found that belief in freedom of content, altruism, and contributing to one's community were self-reported to be highly valued by donors, but fun and family and friends motivations were the only positive predictors for actual donation levels. we discuss the implications of these findings on the sustainability of crowdfunding as a business model for news. © 2015, mass communication & society division of the association for education in journalism and mass communication."
"baker and wurgler [2007] take a ""top down"" approach to behavioral finance and the stock market. investor sentiment is taken to be exogenous, and the focus is on its empirical effects. sentiment is measurable and its waves have clearly discernible, important, and regular effects on individual firms and the stock market as a whole. stocks that are hardest to arbitrage or value are the ones most affected by sentiment. other studies discussed in the article relate to aspects of investor sentiment and sentiment indexes, seeking to help with forecasting stock returns and trade volume and providing a rigorous analysis of the predictive power of investor sentiment."
"behavioral finance researchers have shown that the stock market can be driven by emotions of market participants. in a number of recent studies mood levels have been extracted from social media applications in order to predict stock returns. the paper tries to replicate these findings by measuring the mood states on twitter. the sample consists of roughly 100 million tweets that were published in germany between january, 2011 and november, 2013. in a first analysis, a significant relationship between aggregate twitter mood states and the stock market is not found. however, further analyses also consider mood contagion by integrating the number of twitter followers into the analysis. the results show that it is necessary to take into account the spread of mood states among internet users. based on the results in the training period, a trading strategy for the german stock market is created. the portfolio increases by up to 36 % within a six-month period after the consideration of transaction costs. © 2015 springer fachmedien."
"wealth management is a profession that bridges the art and a science of the discipline and practice. it is argued that wealth management must be built upon a solid theoretical and empirical foundation, similar to that used in the medical profession, that guides practitioners to implement evidence-based wealth management recommendations. a client presenting the same financial/ wealth management data to two wealth managers should generally be given a similar set of recommendations. public trust and the credibility of the wealth managementprofession depends upon a core body of knowledge, assessment of competency, upholding the ethics of the profession, and increasingly utilizing theory and empirical evidence from the academic literature of wealth management, financial planning, finance, economics, behavioral finance, communication, and other related disciplines, given the interdisciplinary nature of wealth management. after reading and reflecting upon this article, the reader should be able to articulate the case that wealth management is a profession and not simply a trade or craft; to define evidence-based wealth management andoffer an example; to list the characteristics of evidence-based wealth management; to differentiate between data and opinion; to identify the levels of analysis; and to differentiate between two wealth management practice models.in conclusion, the decision to practice evidence-based wealth management is not a matter of personal preference, but is an ethical choice that can also serve as the basis for an effective business model. © 2015, institutional investor, inc. all rights reserved."
"unwinding mass incarceration will neither  be cheap nor easy, and to be done responsibly will require a new infrastructure of coordinated community-based facilities and services that can meet evidence-based incarceration needs while also ensuring public safety. it is not easy for former inmates to disentangle themselves from the system or to extricate themselves from the relationships that the system will be monitoring. many of them resume relationships with individuals in communities with high crime rates whose actions attract police attention. even for those with the resolve to change behavior, past relationships can haunt them well into the future. some correctional systems have responded to this research by offering cognitive behavioral programming. through a dissection of past decisions and role-playing scenarios involving criminal activity, participants learn how to slow down impulsive tendencies and to develop more reflective thinking processes. the community correctional residential facilities aim to help soon-to-be released inmates find and secure private-sector employment, reengage with their families, and develop individualized reentry plans that address treatment, housing, finances, and other areas of need. they also require the inmates to pay program fees, taxes, restitution, and child support orders. moving individuals from incarceration to community liberty without proper support and accountability can jeopardize not only the entire reform agenda, but also individuals and communities that are already fragile."
"in the context of the financial management of an organization, there are behavioral patterns that can bias the decision-making process, making the financial manager unable to achieve his/her goal of maximizing value in activities related to financial decisions, particularly those related to investments. one of these biases is called status quo. according to samuelson and zeckhauser (1988), this bias indicates that individuals tend to maintain the current state of their portfolio and have difficulty in changing their financial position. this research examined whether there is a relationship between status quo bias, risk profile and quantitative skills in graduate studentsof economics, accounting, and management. for this purpose, a survey was conducted through questionnaires administered to 330 graduate students at the university of porto (portugal) and federal university of santa catarina (brazil). for the calculation and presentation of indicators that point to the presence of the status quo bias the methodology used was based on samuelson and zeckhauser (1988). in addition, a regression analysis was conducted to find a relationship between the risk profile of the participants and the status quo bias, including some control variables. the results showed that risk-seeker respondents seem to have been less affected by the status quo bias in their decisions, unlike the others. as for the participants who have studied behavioral finance in their undergraduate courses (a proxy for prior knowledge of the studied bias), it was found, on average, an increase of answers on alternatives to the status quo. however, the presence of the status quo bias was still dominant in the total responses. this shows that respondents who had studied behavioral finance opted for alternative options more than other respondents, but, even these individuals showed the status quo bias. thus, we emphasize the importance of understanding the influence of behavioral biases in decision making, because these biases may impair important decisions within an organization. © 2015 mackenzie presbyterian university. all rights reserved."
"the bounded rationality of human behavior has become the most prominent issue nowadays for the researchers of applied economics and finance. a lot of evidence is available that shows the psychological and social patterns merging with individuals' capital markets investing behaviourthat nullifies the well established theories and models of modern finance. the modern financial models like capm argue that the investors are fully rational, and the market is fully efficient as no individual can take the advantage of arbitraging. studies advocating behavioral finance have confirmed social influences and psychological biases which deviate individual investors from their calculated and predetermined decisions, and reject the hypothesis of individuals being fully rational while taking decisions related to stock markets. through this review paper, the concepts related to behavioral finance were illustrated by using various studies, and a conceptual framework showed the influential factors related to behavioral changes impacting the individual investors' decision making, that is, creating irrational investors and inefficient markets. through the review of various studies, we observed that social factors like herding, emotional contagion, imitation, and information cascades along with psychological patterns like representativeness availability and anchoring heuristics are the basic key factors that determine individual decisions. this paper highlighted the common decisional errors made by investors, and the study will be useful for investors and portfolio managers as it will aid them in making their choices keeping the discussed behavioral biases in mind."
"modern general system theory proposed a holistic integrative approach based on input-state-output dynamics as opposed to the traditional reductionist detail based approach. information complexity and uncertainty required a fuzzy system theory, based on fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic. while successful in dealing with analysis, synthesis and control of technical engineering systems, general system theory and fuzzy system theory could not fully deal with humanistic and human-like intelligent systems which combine technical engineering components with human or human-like components characterized by their cognitive, emotional/motivational and behavioral/action levels of operation. such humanistic systems are essential in artificial intelligence, cognitive and behavioral science applications, organization management and social systems, man-machine systems or human factor systems, behavioral knowledge based economics and finance applications. we are introducing here a “postmodern fuzzy system theory” for controlled state dynamics and output fuzzy systems and fuzzy rule based systems using our earlier postmodern fuzzy set theory and a kabbalah possible worlds model of modal logic and semantics type. in order to create a postmodern fuzzy system theory, we “deconstruct” a fuzzy system in order to incorporate in it the cognitive, emotional and behavioral actions and expressions levels characteristic for humanistic systems. kabbalah offers a structural, fractal and hierarchic model for integrating cognition, emotions and behavior. we obtain a canonic deconstruction for a fuzzy system into its cognitive, emotional and behavioral fuzzy subsystems. © 2014 by the authors; licensee mdpi, basel, switzerland."

"subject area: social innovation and entrepreneurship. study level/applicability: the case is suitable for graduate (msc, mba) and advanced undergraduate (bsc, bas) students and applicable for course material focusing on social entrepreneurship, social ventures, strategic management, sustainable development and emerging markets. case overview: this case explores nuru international, a non-profit enterprise established in 2008 with the mission to “end extreme poverty throughout the world”. jake harriman, the founder and ceo of nuru, together with his team are on the onset of diversifying crop offerings among kenyan farmers in an attempt to alleviate challenges stemming from severe climatic changes and low-crop quality. as 2014 is the first year for kenyan farmers to grow alternative crops, the nuru team faces the challenging task of convincing farmers to embrace diversification. additionally, as part of its proof of concept philosophy, nuru is establishing operations in ethiopia. there, nuru has to identify best marketable crops and promote these among ethiopian farmers while empowering and engaging local leaders in the process. finally, the team is looking for financing opportunities for nuru's entrepreneurial mission. their funding opportunities come from the private markets, the philanthropic market and the impact investing space. they are carefully analyzing these options and looking for alternatives in capital markets. pondering on nuru's rewarding experience with kiva, a web-based lending platform, the team wonders if crowdfunding may be a viable option to finance nuru's operations in ethiopia. they are interested in equity crowdfunding but are not sure what might be the associated opportunities and risks. they, therefore, need to assess the merits of the practice and decide on how compelling it is for nuru's expansion plans to ethiopia. expected learning outcomes: the case aims to help students comprehend the role of hybrid organizational designs in meeting broad societal issues such as extreme poverty; evaluate collective impact initiatives in addressing strategic and behavioral changes for organizations operating in contexts of extreme poverty where partnerships are the key for success; assess diverse capital steams for social entrepreneurs and understand how these relate to the stages of evolution of a social venture; and elaborate on crowdfunding as a nascent source of capital for social enterprises. supplementary materials: teaching notes are available for educators only. please contact your library to gain login details or email support@emeraldinsight.com to request teaching notes. © 2014, emerald group publishing limited."
"background: caregivers play a major role in the care of patients with dementia and are themselves at higher risk of disease. objectives: we investigate which factors are associated with caregivers burden of outpatients visiting a memory clinic and how functional autonomy and behavioral and psychological symptoms can influence caregiver burden. methods: the study population was chosen from outpatients with progressive cognitive complaint. the caregiver burden was measured with the short version of the zarit burden interview (zbi). the relationship was assessed between the zbi and the patients characteristics, including neuropsychiatric inventory (npi), instrumental activities of daily living scale (iadl), the mini-mental state examination (mmse), etiology, and stage of the cognitive impairment. results: in a population of 548 patients, iadl, npi, antidepressant drugs, and mmse were found to be related to zbi, while diagnosed etiology and disease stage were not significant: zbi decreased by 0.34 point for every unit of iadl, and by 0.03 point for every unit of mmse; zbi increased by 0.03 point for every unit of npi. from the iadl scale, the ability to handle finances, food preparation, responsibility to take medications, mode of transportation, and ability to use the telephone increased the zbi. five areas of the npi increased the zbi: apathy, agitation, aberrant motor behavior, appetite disorders (p < 0.001), and irritability (p = 0.03). conclusion: caregivers experience a higher burden due to disease symptoms such as impairment of functional autonomy and behavioral and cognitive impairment, whatever the etiology of the cognitive decline. © 2015 -ios press and the authors. all rights reserved."
"permanent supportive housing can be an integral part of new models of integrated care for people with complex health and social needs who experience homelessness or institutionalization, producing better outcomes and ending homelessness for vulnerable people, while also contributing to the more appropriate and less costly use of health care services. the expansion of medicaid eligibility in most states and other changes in health care finance and delivery systems increase opportunities to pay for some of the costs of supportive housing services, but this will require overcoming challenges related to federal and state policies. medicaid benefits may include behavioral health services that can help people with mental health disorders get and keep housing and achieve recovery goals. primary care and behavioral health services can be integrated through partnerships that rely on two different medicaid payment mechanisms. medicaid managed care plans face incentives to invest in care coordination services that control hospital costs. some states are exploring other ways to use medicaid financing to pay for innovative supportive housing programs that can achieve offsetting savings. copyright © taylor & francis group, llc."
"the classical economic theory propounds that human beings are completely rational decision makers who carefully evaluate all facts and evidences before taking decisions that aim at maximizing outcomes. however it has been found that in real life people are not totally rational, rather they are influenced by various behavioral factors while making decisions. this has led to the emergence of the behavioral finance that studies the influence of psychology on financial decisions. the losses or suboptimal outcomes resulting from the irrational decision making of individuals serve as a learning tool for market participants. but, many of the unexplainable behaviour, classified as market anomalies remains questionable. the traditional finance theories have not been quite helpful to answer many questions. behavioral finance and neuro finance are quite successful in answering many of these questions. research is being conducted at a staggering pace in the area of neurofinance and behavioral finance. © 2014 ieee."
"recent work in behavioral finance showed how investors' perceptions (i.e., return expectations, risk tolerance, and risk perception) affect hypothetical trading and risk-taking behavior. however, are such perceptions also capable of explaining actual trading and risk-taking behavior? to answer this question, we combine monthly survey data with matching brokerage records to construct a panel dataset allowing us to simultaneously examine investor perceptions and behavior. we find that investor perceptions and changes therein are important drivers of actual trading and risk-taking behavior: investors with higher levels of and upward revisions of return expectations are more likely to trade, have higher turnover, trade larger amounts per transaction, and use derivatives. investors with higher levels of and upward revisions in risk tolerance are more likely to trade, have higher buy-sell ratios, use limit orders more frequently, and hold riskier portfolios. investors with higher levels of risk perception are more likely to trade, have higher turnover, have lower buy-sell ratios, and hold riskier portfolios. © 2015, copyright © the institute of behavioral finance."
"the basic mission of finance is to set up arrangements whereby people may pursue risky opportunities without themselves being destroyed by this risk, and arrangements that incentivize people to behave in a socially constructive manner. robert shiller (2012) introduction the quote by robert shiller highlights the conflict inherent in financial innovation: on the one hand, it provides opportunities to save and to borrow in order to achieve household objectives and help them manage risks; on the other hand, it creates the possibility that households will be destroyed by the risks entailed in these new and often complicated instruments. finance should guide financial firms in their production of instruments. regulation should be brought in to protect households from the excesses of the financial sector that ultimately cause exploitation of household ignorance or behavioral biases, but also to protect households from using new financial instruments in counterproductive ways. this chapter starts by describing, in “opportunities offered by financial innovation,” some of the opportunities that financial innovation offers for managing risks households face. the third section, “getting into financial trouble,” takes up the issue of how households can get into trouble, in view of recent findings in the household finance literature. “why is regulation needed?” discusses why regulation is needed. “how to regulate?” presents criteria on which regulation can be based. “challenges with different forms of regulation” analyzes challenges with different forms of regulation and presents some recent developments on the regulatory front that relate to the points raised in the chapter. the final section offers concluding remarks. opportunities offered by financial innovation modern households face a number of challenges in financial behavior, some of which are new, but they also have access to innovative financial instruments with which to face these challenges. surprisingly, many of these instruments are heavily underutilized. © cambridge university press 2015."

"do women exhibit greater financial risk aversion than men? we answer this question using attitudinal and behavioral specifications of risk aversion drawn from the 2010 survey of consumer finances (scf). to approximate attitudinal specification of risk aversion, we use individuals' self-reported financial risk tolerance. we use individuals' relative risk aversion, that is, the effect of wealth on the proportion of assets categorized as risky as behavioral specification of risk aversion. we find that while women display greater attitudinal risk aversion, gender difference in behavioral risk aversion depends upon individuals' marital status and role in household finances. single women exhibit greater behavioral risk aversion compared to single men. however, this gender difference does not exist when we compare behavioral risk aversion of married women and men in charge of household finances. copyright © 2015 by emerald group publishing limited. all rights of reproduction in any form reserved."

"conventional theories are based on the assumption that investors are rational beings. all their decisions are logical and judgments fair and rational. based on this assumption, they have derived all their financial models. the capital asset pricing model assumes that investors are rational beings and they have the same expectations. this assumption contradicts behavioral theories, which assume that investors under uncertainty behave in a not-so-rational or irrational manner. the phenomenon of behavioral finance was noticed post-2000, when it bubble was built up and finally busted. during this time period, investors showed herd mentality, and they preferably invested in companies having “.com” attached to them. the market prices of it companies rose much above their intrinsic value or fair value. it also happened in the subprime crisis when real estate prices in the usa started rising much above their fair value. after a certain time period, the bubble collapsed leading to the fall of stock prices, wiping off the hard-earned money of investors. the history of irrational behavior can be traced to the sixteenth century in holland. the tulip bulbs were imported to holland from constantinople. these bulbs became very popular with dutch elite class. trading of these bulbs started on major stock exchanges in europe. the prices rose to great heights and people started trading in bulbs in a big way. after a certain time period, people started selling these bulbs and the prices began falling. people started defaulting on their tulip contracts. this bubble finally collapsed leading to huge losses. therefore, it was realized that there was something which these conventional models were unable to explain. these softer issues were never addressed and recognized by traditional theorist before. it was kahnman and smith who for the first time brought insights from behavioral sciences into the field of finance and economics. they stated that under uncertainty investors do not behave ideally but rather behave normally. the present paper describes the relationship between personality traits and investment pattern of investors. a survey of about 100 investors, who have invested in the stock market, has been conducted. the investors have been classified into various demographic profiles such as gender, age group, income level, number of dependents, profession, and marital status. the data for the study has been collected from both primary and secondary sources. convenience sampling method is used to select the sample of 100 investors. the big five personality test has been incorporated to assess the personality of investors, and its correlation with their investment behavior is being evaluated in the study using various statistical tools. the paper attempts to rate the personality of investors on parameters such as extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness. the study relates the personality of investors with stock market investment, type, objective, factors influencing the investments, and so on. the findings can be useful for portfolio managers, fund managers, and wealth managers to understand the mindset and behavior of their clients. this will facilitate them to construct a portfolio which may be less than optimal and which can be adhered to by the advisor and the client amicably. this is especially significant in the context of managing portfolios in these recovering markets post-recession which the global economies have witnessed in recent times. the concept of behavioral finance is one such emerging area which if incorporated well in the hard-core finance, based on fundamentals, can yield dividends for portfolio managers and equity analyst and also on the wealth generation of the overall economies emerging in the aftermath of the recession. © 2015, springer india."
"the giving of tips – the discretionary payments customers make to certain occupations over and above the price of what they purchase – involves, for any one transaction, small amounts of money. yet, while tips are perceived as a marginal disbursement of little consequence for individual finances, collectively considered, in some countries and for some occupations, tips redistribute large amounts of money and form a sizeable percentage of service workers’ income. mark starbuck, for instance, estimates that in 2006, “british consumers provided no less than 1.9 billion in tips to restaurant waiters alone.” jon elster, who has a short discussion on “the norm of tipping” in explaining social behavior, writes that in the united states “estimates of the fraction of income that waiters derive from tips range from 8 percent (the internal revenue service assumption) to 58 percent for waiters serving full course meals.” ofer azar says that “tips in the us food industry alone amount to about $42 billion annually.” once we add all other occupations which are tipped in the united states – hairdressers, taxi drivers, casino croupiers, beauticians, bartenders, hotel staff, shoe shine, and more – the sums involved become comparable to the total size of charity donations in the united states, estimated, for 2007, at $306 billion. tipping decisions are also an interesting phenomenon per se, eminently suitable for investigating behavioral theories. in many countries, tips are perhaps the only sizeable area of market transactions to be formally unregulated, and furthermore tipping can be easily observed across different types of occupations and transactions. they lose interest where the discretionary element is removed by fiat: this is the case in the few countries in which tips are legally banned, as in angola, singapore; in some communist countries, such as china and north korea; and in establishments in which managers discourage the tipping of staff. conversely, tipping decisions also lose interest once tips are institutionalized into a service charge and become part of the price of a service. although i will not address it here, it is of course an interesting question to ask under what conditions these mandatory states of affairs emerge. © cambridge university press 2014."

"the great monetary experiment designed and administered by the federal reserve under the obama administration unleashed strong irrational forces in global asset markets. the result was a 'monetary plague' which has attacked and corrupted the vital signalling function of financial market prices. this book analyses how quantitative easing caused a sequence of markets to become infected by asset price inflation. it explains how instead of bringing about a quick return to prosperity from the great recession, the monetary experiment failed in its basic purpose. bringing about economic debilitation, major financial speculation, waves of mal-investment in particular areas, and a colossal boom in the private equity industry, the experiment instead produced monetary disorder. brendan brown puts the monetary experiment into a global and historical context, examining in particular japanese 'folklore of deflation' and the federal reserve's first experiment of quantitative easing in the mid-1930s. the author couples analysis from the austrian school of monetary economics and chicago monetarism with insights from behavioral finance, and concludes with major proposals for the present and the future, including ideas for monetary reform in the united states, and suggestions for how investors can survive the current market 'plague'. © brendan brown and alex j. pollock 2015."
"microfinance institutions' (mfis) preference for women borrowers varies internationally and the mfi focus on women borrowers is generally attributed to two reasons: women borrowers are more trustworthy and have greater social impact. however, the role of social trust with regard to this gender preference has not been adequately investigated. we document that mfis favor women more in low trust countries and in countries where social trust formation is primarily behavioral. we interpret these findings as consistent with gender targeting being used as a substitute for social trust. our results should be of considerable interest to policy-makers, managers, and scholars. © 2014 elsevier ltd."
"the article presents a broad and comprehensive guide to personal finance that the author uses to teach financial planning to advisors working for banks and insurance companies. this is an attempt to create a holistic approach to financial planning, managing the risks that could damage the different forms of individuals' wealth: mortality risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, property risk, standard of living risk, and aspirational risk. the main idea is that financial advice should be concerned about the global wealth of individuals. for example, in addition to financial wealth, people who work have the socalled human wealth that derives from their specific ability to generate income. the risks pyramid presented here is an organized process to treat personal finance with a rigorous yet simple method. to achieve it, many insights from behavioral finance are used. © 2015 institutional investor llc. all rights reserved."
"we investigate why investors may be willing to participate in active management, notwithstanding expectations for negative average alpha after fees across all managers. our approach involves modeling the expected outcome from investing in a portfolio of active managers, for investors who believe they have ability to select good managers and may anticipate benefits from replacing managers when alpha expectations fall. numerical calibrations using inputs consistent with the literature find that certain investors can credibly invest through active managers at observed fee levels, most notably institutions. however, participation in active management at fees paid by some retail investors can only be explained by allowing for behavioral biases. our analysis suggests that the wide use of active management reflects a diversity of investors who form expectations based on information other than expected alpha for the average manager, some of which entails cognitive error. © 2015, copyright © the institute of behavioral finance."

"we find that several factors explain an individual investor's style, i.e., the value versus growth orientation of the investor's stock portfolio. first, we find that an investor's style has a biological basis and is partially ingrained in an investor from birth. second, we show that an investor's hedging demands as well as behavioral biases explain investment style. finally, an investor's style is explained by life course theory in that experiences, both earlier and later in life, are related to investment style. investors with adverse macroeconomic experiences (e.g., growing up during the great depression or entering the labor market during an economic recession) or who grow up in a lower socioeconomic status rearing environment have a stronger value orientation several decades later. our research contributes a new perspective to the long-standing value and growth debate in finance. © 2015 elsevier b.v."
"this study examines the effect of firm investment on stock returns by using data on the chinese stock market. we find that stocks with higher investment experience lower future returns and there is an obvious investment effect in the chinese stock market. the investment effect is stronger for firms that have higher cash flows, lower debt or for state-owned firms. we further explore the relation between investment and returns over the 3. years around portfolio formation. the results show that the high investment firms earn higher returns than low investment firms before portfolio formation; however the high investment firms earn lower returns than low investment firms after portfolio formation, such evidence is supportive of investor's overreaction explanation. additionally, the stock returns don't necessarily decrease after investment, and the stock returns don't significantly positively correlate with firm profitability or book-to-market, so the result don't support risk-based explanation. overall, both our portfolio sort and two-stage cross-sectional regression analysis show that behavioral finance theories are better than risk-based theories in explaining the investment anomaly. evidence from the chinese stock market provides a useful perspective to understand the debate on the investment anomaly. © 2014 elsevier b.v."
"recent years have witnessed a growing interest in behavioral trends in both economic theory and practical applications. as a science with vast potential for explaining complex market behaviors, behavioral economics is drifting away from the classical model of homo oeconomicus deployed by mainstream economics. this paper discusses the significance and role of the homo oeconomicus model in light of behavioral economics. it analyzes the direction of changes affecting homo oeconomicus, examines the definition of anomalies within the context of behavioral economics and discusses the anomalous status of homo oeconomicus. the paper proposes a hypothesis that the attitude characterizing homo oeconomicus is unique and incidental. the presented interdisciplinary analysis relies on economics, behavioral economics, economic psychology, behavioral finance and the methodology of science to discuss the homo oeconomicus model. the paper reviews change trends in economics, which are largely propelled by advancements in behavioral economics. the key methodological tools deployed in this paper are theoretical analysis and a compilation of extensive research findings. the results were used to formulate new theories advocating the development of a modern approach to the homo oeconomicus model, recognizing its significance and the growing importance of behavioral economics. © 2014 wyzsza szkola finansow i zarzadzania w warszawie. all rights reserved."
"purpose - this paper aims to use lean six sigma (lss) and consumption mapping concepts to develop a disciplined methodology for a self-directed investor so that adverse decision-making behaviors are avoided. classical financial theories assume that individuals maximize expected utility by arriving at financial decisions in a rational manner. but, over time, investor performance has lagged behind corresponding market performance. despite these results and research on their causes, investors continue to repeat systematic mistakes leading to suboptimal financial outcomes. design/methodology/approach - consumption maps are developed based on behavioral finance research that shows why investors make predictable and costly errors in their decision making. the authors show that the contemporary methodologies within lss, used successfully in the manufacturing and service sectors, can be used to enforce rationality in investing. findings - the approach proposed herein provides a new framework that researchers should be able to test in practice. by applying a structured, disciplined approach based on the design- measure-analyze-improve-control (dmaic) methodology of lss, it is posited that the gap between financial theory and actual results can be bridged. originality/value - rather than hoping to avoid irrational behavior through self-awareness of behavioral biases, the dmaic approach will standardize self-directed investor decision-making so that discipline is enforced. © emerald group publishing limited."
"the aim of this paper is to present a critical review of the most relevant theories for portfolio selection built on the behavioral finance approach, in which the influence of emotional and psychological factors over financial decisions is analyzed. the traditional modern portfolio theory approach is contrasted with behavioral models such as safety first, security-potential/aspiration (sp/a), behavioral portfolio, and maslowian portfolio, to conclude that the optimal mean-variance allocation does not necessarily correspond to those found under behavioral assumptions. this article provides conceptual elements for a better understanding of the profiles and interests of the investor, as a basis for future applied research oriented to support the investment advice process in financial institutions. © 2015, pontificia universidad javeriana. all rights reserved."

"ramping tricks of trade-based stock manipulation have evolved greatly in the fight with stricter market regulation, and can be extremely complicated nowadays. despite the rigidity and soundness, theoretical models proposed in extant literature can hardly be applied directly to real market data, due to their assumptions being far away from reality. on the other hand, empirical studies of ramping manipulation still lack guidance and support from theories that can better reflect ramping details in practice. this paper addresses this gap by constructing a theoretical model that is closely linked to practical detection, in the framework of behavioral finance. new insights into concrete ramping manipulation tricks are also contributed to the literature. the potential of the model for manipulation detection is demonstrated by applying it to the two most infamous manipulation cases in the history of chinese stock market. © 2013, springer science+business media new york."

"the goal of this research was to develop a model to predict which students with disabilities will drop out before graduation and to investigate the drop out pattern of students with disabilities. to accomplish this we evaluated potential predictors of persistence and drop-out among 611 college and university students with various disabilities and developed a prediction model. we tested this model in a retrospective study using an independent sample of actual graduates (formula presented.) and premature leavers (formula presented.). results show that the best predictors of academic persistence and drop-out are the three theory of planned behavior scales. these predicted 25 % of the variance in intention to graduate and correctly classified 83 % o f participants who were no longer in school (86 % of graduates and 74 % of premature leavers). path analysis showed linkages between demographic, academic performance, personality, self-efficacy, and college experience measures and the three theory of planned behavior predictors. key reasons for dropping out were: disability, health, finances, career direction uncertainty, inadequate disability accommodations, and lack of interest/motivation. a one-page questionnaire based on the theory of planned behavior (i.e., attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control) can add to the literature on predictors of intention to graduate, graduation and drop-out among college and university students with disabilities; this is enclosed in the “appendix”. © 2014, springer science+business media dordrecht."
"current evidence on the predictability of technical analysis largely concentrates on price-based technical indicators such as moving averages rules and trading range breakout rules. in contrast, the predictability of widely used technical market indicators such as advance/decline lines, volatility indices, and short-term trading indices has drawn limited attention. although some market indicators have also become popular sentiment proxies in the behavioral finance field to predict returns, the results generally rely on using just one or a few indicators at a time. this approach raises the risk of data snooping, since so many proxies are proposed. we review and examine the profitability of a wide range of 93 market indicators. we give these technical market indicators the benefit of the doubt, but even then we find little evidence that they predict stock market returns. this conclusion continuously holds even if we allow predictability to be state dependent on business cycles or sentiment regimes. © 2014 elsevier b.v."

"since the attribution of the nobel prize in 2002 to kahneman for prospect theory, behavioral finance has become an increasingly important subfield of finance. however the main parts of behavioral finance, prospect theory included, understand financial markets through individual investment behavior. behavioral finance thereby ignores any interaction between participants. we introduce a socio-financial model (vitting andersen j. and nowak a., an introduction to socio-finance (springer, berlin) 2013) that studies the impact of communication on the pricing in financial markets. considering the simplest possible case where each market participant has either a positive (bullish) or negative (bearish) sentiment with respect to the market, we model the evolution of the sentiment in the population due to communication in subgroups of different sizes. nonlinear feedback effects between the market performance and changes in sentiments are taken into account by assuming that the market performance is dependent on changes in sentiments (e.g., a large sudden positive change in bullishness would lead to more buying). the market performance in turn has an impact on the sentiment through the transition probabilities to change an opinion in a group of a given size. the idea is that if for example the market has observed a recent downturn, it will be easier for even a bearish minority to convince a bullish majority to change opinion compared to the case where the meeting takes place in a bullish upturn of the market. within the framework of our proposed model, financial markets stylized facts such as volatility clustering and extreme events may be perceived as arising due to abrupt sentiment changes via ongoing communication of the market participants. the model introduces a new volatility measure which is apt of capturing volatility clustering and from maximum-likelihood analysis we are able to apply the model to real data and give additional long term insight into where a market is heading. copyright © epla, 2014."

"behavioral finance is under construction as a solid structure of finance. it incorporates parts of standard finance, replaces others, and includes bridges between theory, evidence, and practice. behavioral finance substitutes normal people for the rational people in standard finance. it substitutes behavioral portfolio theory for mean-variance portfolio theory, and behavioral asset pricing model for the capm and other models where expected returns are determined only by risk. behavioral finance also distinguishes rational markets from hard-to-beat markets in the discussion of efficient markets, a distinction that is often blurred in standard finance, and it examines why so many investors believe that it is easy to beat the market. moreover, behavioral finance expands the domain of finance beyond portfolios, asset pricing, and market efficiency and is set to continue that expansion while adhering to the scientific rigor introduced by standard finance. © 2014 borsa istanbul anonim şirketi."
"this paper presents an original essay that explains the correlation between transport firms' technical efficiency and managerial optimism. we initiate a debate concerning the potential role of chief executive officers' (ceo) irrationalities in explaining the inefficiency of public transport operators, such as the shortfall between the optimal production function and the observed production level. stochastic frontier analysis (sfa) methods are applied to our sample over a twelve-year period from 2000 to 2011, where we aim to detect the potential effect of a well-documented bias in behavioral economic and finance theory: the managerial optimism bias. using two proxies of managerial optimism based on the 2005 work of malmendier and tate as well as following recommendations of cognitive psychology and using an sfa approach, we find strong evidence of the negative impact of ceos' optimism bias on transport firms' technical efficiency, meaning that managerial optimism decreases transport firms' technical efficiency. © 2014 elsevier b.v."
"one of the main arguments of behavioral finance is that some properties of asset prices are most probably regarded as deviations from fundamental value and they are generated by the participation of traders who are not fully rational, thus called noise traders. noise trader theory postulates that sentiment traders have greater impact during high-sentiment periods than during low-sentiment periods, and sentiment traders miscalculate the variance of returns undermining the mean-variance relation. the main objective of this research is to construct a model to evaluate the returns and conditional volatility of various stock market indexes considering the changes in the investor sentiment by measuring the effects of noise trader demand shocks on returns and volatility. egarch model is used to determine whether earning shocks have more influence on the conditional volatility in high sentiment periods weakening the mean-variance relation. this paper takes an international approach using weekly market index returns of u.s., japan, hong kong, u.k., france, germany, and turkey. weekly trading volumes of these indexes are regressed against a group of macroeconomic variables and the residuals are used as proxies for investor sentiment and significant evidence is found that there is asymmetric volatility in these market indexes and earning shocks have more influence on conditional volatility when the sentiment is high. © 2013 springer science+business media dordrecht."
"infrastructure comprises a very large and diverse set of physical systems and social services, and financial strategies inevitably reflect the breadth of the concept. infrastructure systems are essential to urban sustainability, and can resonate with urban and natural environments depending on their design. over more than a century, for example, the water supplies of urban areas have been supplemented and supported by water sources often located many hundreds of miles away from where they are used (zimmerman 2009, p. 229), and this practice is often not without conflicts. energy resources including fuels have been similarly drawn from long distances to serve cities and their regions. new technologies and behavioral changes have been emerging to promote sustainability, supplementing and, in some cases, replacing traditional infrastructures that rely on distant resources, and these new approaches will present challenges to infrastructure finance. the extent to which infrastructure finance reflects urban sustainability goals will require public buy-in. public opinion polls have shown that infrastructure categories tend to rank low as a priority; however, the areas that infrastructure impacts either directly or indirectly tend to rank higher. © daniel a. mazmanian and hilda blanco 2014. all rights reserved."

"there is substantial scientific research suggesting the physical and psychological health benefits of a physically active lifestyle. consequently, governments worldwide prioritize policies, finances, and resources in healthcare, education, and sports sectors to increase mass participation in physical activity. however, practices in physical activity promotion are often not underpinned by evidence-based standardization that is requisite in other domains of epidemiology. the aim of this article is to examine critically the available scientific research on promoting life-long physical activity participation and to propose an evidence-based model for implementation in school physical education. reasons are discussed as to why programs that integrate physical, psychological, and behavioral skills have been long acknowledged in physical education and physical activity domains but remain lacking in empirical validation. finally, future directions are suggested that are required to examine the application of this approach to practice in primary-level physical education. © , copyright © national association for kinesiology in higher education (nakhe)."
"we adopt the classical fama and french (1992) [e.f. fama, k.r. french, the cross-section of expected stock returns, the journal of finance, 47 (1992) 427 - 465.] approach to investigate the effect of beta, size, leverage, book value to market value (b/p), and earnings to price (e/p) ratio on the average monthly returns in the china stock market (csm) from july 1998 to june 2011. the phenomenon of concept drift was found in this research. our results indicate that the b/p has a significant negative correlation with the monthly average returns during this period, in contrast to the positive correlation found by a previous study by wang and di iorio (2007) [y. wang, a. di iorio, the cross section of expected stock returns in the chinese a-share market, global finance journal, 17 (2007) 335 - 349.] that covered from july 1996 to june 2002. meanwhile the small-firm effect remains significant. thus, while the behavioral or institutional factors may account for the counter-intuitive finding of the effect of value in the transitional economy, the relationship between fundamental characteristics and stock returns is more complex in china and warrants more rigorous investigation. further, we suggest that autonomic and cloud computing system has a number of potential applications in stock market concept drift mining. © 2014 ieee."
"whereas the 1970s saw the dominance of the spatial analytical tradition in urban geography challenged by the emergence of behavioral, humanistic, phenomenological, and historical materialist approaches, the 1980s forced many urban geographers to consider afresh both the nature of their subject matter and their theoretical and methodological approaches to it. all of us were grappling with the empirical consequences and theoretical implications of a sea change in economic, political, and cultural life in the worldsleading economies. the pivotal point had been the system shock to the international economy that had occurred in the mid-1970s. the eurodollar market, swollen by the u.s. governments deficit budgeting and by the huge reserves of u.s. dollars resulting from the quadrupling of crude oil prices in the wake of an opec embargo, quickly evolved into a new, sophisticated system of international finance, with new patterns of investment and disinvestment, contributing to new and modified geographies at every scale. toward the end of the decade, amid a phase of deindustrialization, thatcherism and reaganomics propagated a climate of privatization based on theidea that welfare states not only had generated unreasonably high levels of taxation, budget deficits, disincentives to work and save, anda bloated class of unproductive workers, but also that they fostered soft attitudes toward problem groups in society: disadvantaged households and individuals (whose numbers were increasing as a result of the new spatial divisions of labor associated with the onset of globalization). the u.s. presidents commission for a national agenda for the eighties accepted the inevitability of a nearly permanent underclass, but nevertheless there was a marked shift away from collective consumption and keynesian economic management toward deregulated capital accumulation. new social formations were emerging as part of post-industrial societies in most oecd countries. new urban forms were beginning to emerge in response to socioeconomic polarization and to the recentralization of high-order producer services. meanwhile, the transnational material culture associated with the new economy was accelerating the attenuation of the meaning of place in peoples lives. © 2005 by taylor & francis group, llc. all rights reserved."
"we are looking for the agent-based treatment of the financial markets considering necessity to build bridges between microscopic, agent based, and macroscopic, phenomenological modeling. the acknowledgment that agent-based modeling framework, which may provide qualitative and quantitative understanding of the financial markets, is very ambiguous emphasizes the exceptional value of well defined analytically tractable agent systems. herding as one of the behavior peculiarities considered in the behavioral finance is the main property of the agent interactions we deal with in this contribution. looking for the consentaneous agent-based and macroscopic approach we combine two origins of the noise: exogenous one, related to the information flow, and endogenous one, arising form the complex stochastic dynamics of agents. as a result we propose a three state agent-based herding model of the financial markets. from this agent-based model we derive a set of stochastic differential equations, which describes underlying macroscopic dynamics of agent population and log price in the financial markets. the obtained solution is then subjected to the exogenous noise, which shapes instantaneous return fluctuations. we test both gaussian and q-gaussian noise as a source of the short term fluctuations. the resulting model of the return in the financial markets with the same set of parameters reproduces empirical probability and spectral densities of absolute return observed in new york, warsaw and nasdaq omx vilnius stock exchanges. our result confirms the prevalent idea in behavioral finance that herding interactions may be dominant over agent rationality and contribute towards bubble formation. © 2014 gontis, kononovicius."

"investment decision making focuses on how investors make decisions to buy or sell securities. what guides their choices among alternatives, what are their investment objectives, constraints, and risk profile; and ultimately, what influences their decision making during the stock selection process. behavioural finance deals with the psychology of the investor. it tries to explain how an investor makes an investment decision and how behavioural and other factors influence the decision making of an investor. behavioural factors primarily include behavioural biases and personal characteristics of an investor, that is, personality, attitude, risk tolerance, and demographic factors, while other factors include external contextual factors like accounting information, market situations, brand image, and so forth, which have a bearing on decision making. the present paper provides an in-depth review of literature of prominent studies in the area of behavioural finance. the first part of the paper explains the concept of behavioral finance, the second part gives a detailed discussion on the classification of behavioural biases, and the third part discusses the effect of behavioural biases on the trading behaviour of the investors and the feelings of investors after experiencing the outcomes of investment. towards the end, a comprehensive framework has been formulated representing the influence of behavioural biases on investment behaviour of an investor. the paper concludes that behavioural biases play a significant role in the decision making of the investors, and these biases not only shape the current investment decisions, but also influence investors' future decision making."
"this paper explains the need for supplementing traditional financial and economic factors with softer cultural and institutional measures in explaining the determinants of firm financing. the theoretical arguments are based on the incompleteness of contracts and therefore the important role of ethics and behavioral norms in the need and cost of enforcing such contracts. the practical argument is simply that adding these soft factors to traditional economic factors provides a better and more complete explanation of firm financing. this paper notes the lack of such literature in mainstream finance journals in spite of these demonstrated needs. finally, this paper introduces the papers in this issue and their contributions. © 2013 elsevier b.v."

"in this paper, making use of the methods of empirical analysis and monte carlo simulation, we study the relationship between top managers’ confidence level and firm value. the empirical study is based on panel data of a shares on shanghai stock exchange, and the results show that the overconfidence of top managers has a significant negative effect on firm value, and this influence is more outstanding in state controlled companies; while top managers’ appropriate confidence has a positive effect on firm value, but ultimate controller type has no significant moderate effect on it. by monte carlo simulation system, we simulate the investment and financing decisions of top managers of different confidence levels, and come along with the conclusion that with the enhancements of top managers’ confidence, the firm value increment would firstly increase and then decrease. this trend shows top managers’ appropriate confidence is conductive to enhance firm value, however overconfidence will cause damage to the firm value. the simulation not only further validates the correctness of our assumptions, but also is a bold attempt to the behavioral corporate finance theory. © 2014 pakistan journal of statistics."
"we build on the robust quantitative literature on behavioral responses to the earned income tax credit (eitc) by using in-depth qualitative interviews with 115 eitc recipients to examine how they understand and respond to its incentive structures regarding earnings, marriage, and childbearing. we find that respondents consider their tax refund as a whole, without differentiating the portion from the eitc; as a result, they cannot predict how their eitc refund would change if they altered their labor supply or marital status. incentives for childbearing are better understood, but are not specific to the eitc; rather, parents respond to a combination of tax deductions and credits as a whole. respondents would like to maximize their refunds, but most cannot or would not alter their behavior due to structural constraints they face in the labor and marriage markets. rather than adjust work hours, defer marriage, or have additional children, respondents exhibit a different type of behavioral response to the incentive structure of the eitc: they alter their tax filing status in order to maximize their refunds. they routinely claim zero exemptions and deductions on their w-4s, file their tax returns as head of household rather than as married, and divide children among the tax returns of multiple caregivers. although some of these behaviors qualify as tax noncompliance, they emerge because the intricacies of the tax code conflict with the complexity and fluidity of finances and family life in low-income households. © 2013 by the association for public policy analysis and management."
"in this paper we examine what the study of asset pricing owes to the latter nobel 2013 laureates' seminal contributions. we mainly refer to the efficiency of the financial markets in transmitting information through the prices and, more specifically, to the predictabilty of asset returns. we first recall the concept of market efficiency formulated by fama in 1970 and we give an overview of the numerous empirical studies about this concept during the ten years after this contribution and more precisely on the predictability in short run returns. typically these methods find very modest predictability. then we recall how shiller questioned the efficiency property in 1981, by pointing out the ""excess volatility"" of prices compared to the one of the fundamentals and how this finding inspired many empirical studies on the predictability in long run returns. both fama and shiller and many others discovered that such predictability becomes an important and even the dominant influence on longer-run movements in asset prices. two main strands of research have thus followed. broadly speaking, fama believes that asset price movements can be understood using economic models with rational investors, whereas shiller does not. indeed the first strand advocated by fama consists in improving the models explaining the pricing of financial assets while maintaining the rational expectation hypothesis; using the econometric method of gmm introduced by hansen [1982] is thus decisive to test the non linear constraints implied by these models. on the other side, shiller helped to launch the strand of resarch related to behavioral finance, and investigated, as well as hansen and others, deviations from rational expectations."
"purpose – the purpose of this paper is to suggest that in the arena of human capital, risk-mitigation may overshadow risk-optimized decisions, and show how a more balanced approach can be achieved by understanding and applying frameworks from behavioral decision theory, as well as framing human capital risk using tools and frameworks that have a long history in other management arenas, such as finance. design/methodology/approach – review risk-optimization frameworks in human resource and general management, distill key connections, suggest ways to enhance risk optimization for human capital, and offer suggestions for future research and practice. findings – for human capital, risk-mitigation may overshadow risk-optimization, a balanced approach can be achieved by applying behavioral decision theory and by using frameworks from other management arenas, such as finance. practical implications – organizations must acknowledge and skillfully manage the connections between human capital and competitive strategy in this emerging arena of human capital risk, or they will miss key strategic opportunities. originality/value – attention to human capital risk has largely emphasized minimizing or controlling unwanted outcomes, but the paper proposes that risk-optimization requires balanced attention to risk-taking as well. © 2014, emerald group publishing limited."

"this paper provides an analysis of revenue and welfare effects associated with a vat exemption of financial services, which is common among oecd countries. we follow a general equilibrium approach that considers effects of repealing the vat exemption not only on consumer demand and intermediate-input demand for financial services, but takes account also of the vat distortion of labor supply. we derive formal expressions for revenue and welfare effects, which can be quantified with a minimum of information about behavioral effects. using vat statistics as well as national accounts, we provide quantitative estimates of the effects of repealing the vat exemption in germany. our baseline estimate indicates that tax revenues would increase by some €1.7 billion or 1.3 % of vat revenues (excluding import turnover tax). provided these revenue gains are used to finance a reduction in the vat rate or in other distortive labor taxes our results indicate a modest welfare gain of about €1 billion, or 0.04 % of gdp. © 2013, springer science+business media new york."

"the stock market represents the mood of the society which is unpredictable, unstable, and irrational in nature, outcomes of this fickle mood cannot be predicted merely on the basis of fundamental model of financial economic. behavioral finance demonstrates the reasons behind this phenomenon. individual investors behavior is based on the notion of bounded rationality, the psychological and socio-cultural factors are the key determinants of their investment decision in stock market. number of literature has been advocated the behavioral biases and those biases deviates them from rational decision making and reject the hypothesis of fully efficient market which is the foundation of traditional finance. in this review paper the limitation of traditional finance and the most citing behavioral aspects have been illustrated through a conceptual framework which shows the factors of behavioral changes and the result thereon that is the presence of irrational investors and inefficient market. through the various literatures it is found that social factors like age, income, education, gender, peers participation in stock market and the psychological patterns like representativeness availability and the anchoring heuristics are the basic key factors to determine the individual decisions."
"using a behavioral finance approach we study the impact of behavioral bias. we construct an artificial market consisting of fundamentalists and chartists to model the decision-making process of various agents. the agents differ in their strategies for evaluating stock prices, and exhibit differing memory lengths and confidence levels. when we increase the heterogeneity of the strategies used by the agents, in particular the memory lengths, we observe excess volatility and kurtosis, in agreement with real market fluctuations - indicating that agents in real-world financial markets exhibit widely differing memory lengths. we incorporate the behavioral traits of adaptive confidence and observe a positive correlation between average confidence and return rate, indicating that market sentiment is an important driver in price fluctuations. the introduction of market confidence increases price volatility, reflecting the negative effect of irrationality in market behavior. © 2014 bertella et al."

"traditional mainstream financial theories usually focus on the assumption of rational man. many scholars often suppose that stock market is the efficient market and security price fully reflects information gained by investors from stock market. but with financial anomalies emerging, many new subjects related to physics, psychology and computer science etc., are rising and forming behavioral finance, financial physics and network finance. this paper using fractal analysis method studies fractal properties of china's stock price fluctuation and arrives at a conclusion that market trend would be slightly overturned in the case of hurst index value lower than a critical point. then bp neural network is used for fitting the trend of china's stock price fluctuation. we construct a three-layer neural network that is applied to weight adjustment between neurons located in different layers. experiment results show that the prediction curve of network outputs has a better fitting with the real curve of original sample data, so bp neural network in this paper has the preferable predication performance. © 2014 ieee."

"in 2009, europe was hit by one of the worst debt crises in history. although the eurozone crisis is often depicted as an effect of government mismanagement and corruption, it was a consequence of the 2008 u.s. banking crisis which was caused by more than three decades of neoliberal policies, financial deregulation and widening economic inequities. evidence indicates that the eurozone crisis disproportionately affected vulnerable populations in society and caused sharp increases of suicides and deaths due to mental and behavioral disorders especially among those who lost their jobs, houses and economic activities because of the crisis. although little research has, so far, studied the effects of the crisis on health inequities, evidence showed that the 2009 economic downturn increased the number of people living in poverty and widened income inequality especially in european countries severely hit by the debt crisis. data, however, also suggest favorable health trends and a reduction of traffic deaths fatalities in the general population during the economic recession. moreover, egalitarian policies protecting the most disadvantaged populations with strong social protections proved to be effective in decoupling the link between job losses and suicides. unfortunately, policy responses after the crisis in most european countries have mainly consisted in bank bailouts and austerity programs. these reforms have not only exacerbated the debt crisis and widened inequities in wealth but also failed to address the root causes of the crisis. in order to prevent a future financial downturn and promote a more equitable and sustainable society, european governments and international institutions need to adopt new regulations of banking and finance as well as policies of economic redistribution and investment in social protection. these policy changes, however, require the abandonment of the neoliberal ideology to craft a new global political economy where markets and gross domestic product (gdp) are no longer the main national policy goals, but just means to human and health improvements. © 2014 de vogli; licensee biomed central."
"risk taking is central to human activity. consequently, it lies at the focal point of behavioral sciences such as neuroscience, economics, and finance. many influential models from these sciences assume that financial risk preferences form a stable trait. is this assumption justified and, if not, what causes the appetite for risk to fluctuate? we have previously found that traders experience a sustained increase in the stress hormone cortisol when the amount of uncertainty, in the form of market volatility, increases. here we ask whether these elevated cortisol levels shift risk preferences. using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over protocol we raised cortisol levels in volunteers over 8 d to the same extent previously observed in traders. we then tested for the utility and probability weighting functions underlying their risk taking and found that participants became more risk-averse. we also observed that the weighting of probabilities became more distorted among men relative to women. these results suggest that risk preferences are highly dynamic. specifically, the stress response calibrates risk taking to our circumstances, reducing it in times of prolonged uncertainty, such as a financial crisis. physiology-induced shifts in risk preferences may thus be an underappreciated cause of market instability."
"behavioral finance is under construction as a solid structure of finance. it substitutes normal people for rational people in standard finance, behavioral portfolio theory for mean-variance portfolio theory, and behavioral asset pricing models for the capm and other models where expected returns are determined only by risk. behavioral finance also distinguishes rational markets from hard-to-beat markets in the discussion of efficient markets and examines why so many investors believe that beating the market is easy. peter bernstein encouraged and guided the author of this article as he contributed to the construction of behavioral finance in the pages of the journal of portfolio management (jpm). the jpm's fortieth anniversary, the first ten-year anniversary without peter, is an opportunity for the author to express his gratitude to peter once more and describe his work published in jpm. © 2014, institutional investor, inc. all rights reserved."
"a large body of literature claims that corporate sustainable development is a cross-functional challenge, which requires all functional units to be involved. however, it remains uncertain to what extent and in which way different corporate functions are actually involved in corporate sustainability management. to bridge this research gap, our paper draws on a concept of involvement introduced in the field of consumer behavior. based on this previous research, our paper distinguishes two components of involvement: first, a cognitive-affective component, incorporating being affected by sustainability issues and being supportive of corporate sustainability; and second, a behavioral component, represented by the application of sustainability management tools. we use this concept to empirically analyze the involvement of corporate functions in sustainability management and find considerable differences in large german companies. whereas public relations and strategic management are heavily involved, finance, accounting and management control appear not to be involved. a multinomial logistic regression shows that the cognitive-affective component significantly influences the behavioral component, with a functional unit being affected influencing the application of tools the most. building on the model proposed, the paper provides implications on how to increase a functional unit's involvement in sustainability management. © 2014 by the authors."
"this paper analyzes whether behavioral issues can be partly responsible for the strong financial performance of a student managed investment portfolio (smip). the smip data include 144 monthly return observations from january, 2002 to december, 2013. the smip portfolio outperformed the s&p 500 by an average of 247 basis points per year over the lifetime of the fund. the smip portfolio also recently finished first in the ""undergraduate growth"" category at the global asset management education forum in march, 2014. this data is quite unique because smip is managed by college juniors and seniors majoring in finance. the student managers in the smip portfolio are generally not tied to any preconceived notion of security prices since they are inheriting portfolios from previous classes, and were therefore not involved in selecting securities presently in the portfolio. this paper provides the specific trading data related to the fund. the authors attribute the strong performance of the smip fund to behavioral biases that were not present in the student investor selection process, particularly anchoring, overconfidence, and the disposition effect related to investor decisions. © kevin wynne, ron filante, 2014."
"financial decision making under time pressure, though ubiquitous, is poorly understood; classical and behavioral finance are silent about the time required for a decision to be made. in an experiment, calibrating allowable decision times to 1, 3, and 5 s, we find that classical moment-based preferences reflect time-invariant sensitivity to expected reward, purchase impulsiveness under extreme time pressure, and decreased aversion to variance and increased aversion to skewness with decision time. these time-varying sensitivities translate into increased probability distortions and decreased risk aversion for gains under prospect theory (pt). strikingly, moment-based theory provides a better fit than pt. © the authors 2013. published by oxford university press [on behalf of the european finance association]. all rights reserved."
"in spite of cultural dimensions being included in hundreds of business and management research studies, there have been relatively few studies in finance and accounting that include the use of cultural dimensions. we note the need for such studies in accounting and finance and review published studies in these areas that use cultural dimensions. we conclude that both the accounting and finance fields make sparse use of cultural dimensions in scholarship. however, the field of accounting has made greater use of cultural dimensions than the field of finance. we note that this is in part due to particular seminal theories regarding the connection of national culture with the behavior of individuals in accounting. finance, on the other hand, has been more focused on effects of larger market aggregates. finance just recently seems to have discovered the impact of national culture, particularly via the impact of individualism on market momentum and the impact of uncertainty avoidance on transaction costs. we conclude that there is much opportunity for further investigation of the impact of national culture on finance. thus, the field of finance is being well served by the journal of behavioral and experimental finance championing research on cultural finance. © 2014 elsevier b.v."

"recent studies in behavioral finance discover that emotional impulses of stock investors affect stock prices. the challenge lies in how to quantify such sentiment to predict stock market movements. in this article, we propose a media-aware quantitative trading strategy utilizing sentiment information of web media. this is achieved by capturing public mood from interactive behaviors of investors in social media and studying the impact of firm-specific news sentiment on stocks along with such public mood. our experiments on the csi 100 stocks during a three-month period show that a predictive performance in closeness to the actual future stock price is 0.612 in terms of root mean squared error, the same direction of price movement as the future price is 55.08%, and a simulation trading return is up to 166.11%. ©2014 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved."

"we present an overview of behavioral finance's consistent role in portfolio theory and market theory through utility theory. since bernoulli, the subjective nature of utility has been increasingly generalized for questionable purposes. behavioral finance is reverting back to the original intents of utility theory. we also examine the statistical methods used to determine their suitability for the task at hand. given the heterogeneous population at the market and individual security level, we suggest that nonparametric nonlinear statistics are best suited for descriptive and inferential analysis of all possible investor preferences. © 2014 elsevier b.v."
"the excessive volatility of prices in financial markets is one of the most pressing puzzles in social science. it has led many to question economic theory, which attributes beneficial effects to markets in the allocation of risks and the aggregation of information. in exploring its causes, we investigated to what extent excessive volatility can be observed at the individual level. economists claim that securities prices are forecasts of future outcomes. here, we report on a simple experiment in which participants were rewarded to make the most accurate possible forecast of a canonical financial time series. we discovered excessive volatility in individual-level forecasts, paralleling the finding at the market level. assuming that participants updated their beliefs based on reinforcement learning, we show that excess volatility emerged because of a combination of three factors. first, we found that submitted forecasts were noisy perturbations of participants' revealed beliefs. second, beliefs were updated using a prediction error based on submitted forecast rather than revealed past beliefs. third, in updating beliefs, participants maladaptively decreased learning speed with prediction risk. our results reveal formerly undocumented features in individual-level forecasting that may be critical to understand the inherent instability of financial markets and inform regulatory policy. © 2014 © the institute of behavioral finance."
"we construct an asset market in a finite horizon overlapping-generations environment. subjects are tested for comprehension of their fundamental value exchange environment and then reminded during each of 25 periods of the environment's declining new value. we observe price bubbles forming when new generations enter the market with additional liquidity and bursting as old generations exit the market and withdrawing cash. the entry and exit of traders in the market creates an m shaped double bubble price path over the life of the traded asset. this finding is significant in documenting that bubbles can reoccur within one extended trading horizon and, consistent with previous cross-subject comparisons, shows how fluctuations in market liquidity influence price paths. we also find that trading experience leads to price expectations that incorporate fundamental value. © 2014 copyright the institute of behavioral finance."

"the premise of unbounded rationality defended by the efficient market hypothesis is challenged by the theoretical framework that involves behavioral finance, whose basis, kahneman and tversky’s prospect theory (1979), questions the expected utility theory, an important element of neoclassical economics, as basis for decisionmaking. this research aims to replicate the empirical research of kahneman and tversky’s seminal article (1979) to evaluate the decisionmaking process of employees (potential investors) from a major national financial institution. the results of this study were compared to those obtained in the original article and to other similar studies. the questionnaire employed was an adaptation of the one originally used, so that we could test, in the studied sample, the applicability of the prospect theory, more specifically with regard to certainty, reflection and isolation effects. we also analyzed differences in the decision-making process considering respondents’ attributes (gender, age and income). the results confirmed that behavioral effects do exist, and proved that a large portion of the sample presented significant inconsistency in their choices according to expected utility theory principles, highlighting that their decisions were not made according to strictly rational behavior. furthermore, we analyzed the relationship between violations and investor characteristics by estimating a linear model. results indicate that both age and level of income were negatively related to total violations. © fecap."
"we survey the textual sentiment literature, comparing and contrasting the various information sources, content analysis methods, and empirical models that have been used to date. we summarize the important and influential findings about how textual sentiment impacts on individual, firm-level and market-level behavior and performance, and vice versa. we point to what is agreed and what remains controversial. promising directions for future research are emerging from the availability of more accurate and efficient sentiment measures resulting from increasingly sophisticated textual content analysis coupled with more extensive field-specific dictionaries. this is enabling more wide-ranging studies that use increasingly sophisticated models to help us better understand behavioral finance patterns across individuals, institutions and markets. © 2014 elsevier inc."
"this research aims to encapsulate the idea by lee (2003) and bird and casavecchia (2007b) by designing an investment strategy that exploits value, fundamental and momentum anomalies. this fusion strategy has underpinnings in the realm of behavioral finance, namely the value-growth phenomenon and the momentum effect. using data of all shares listed on the johanesburg securities exchange (jse) in south africa, those considered value shares are selected. from that sample, those that are fundamentally sound and exhibit winning momentum characteristics are chosen. nominal returns of the strategy show promising results as the fusion strategy outperformed both active and passive benchmarks chosen, after costs. the coefficient of variation, a simple measure of variability in the mean return, indicates that an investor seeking higher returns (with higher volatility) would invest in the fusion strategy. on a risk adjusted basis, the results were inconclusive based on the sharpe and treynor ratios, but fairly promising based on the sortino ratio. the sortino ratio shows that the fusion strategy outperforms all benchmarks chosen, except the absa select equity fund (known as fund a). statistical testing shows that the returns of the strategy are significantly different from zero and follow a non-linear data generating process. although the screening methods are chosen based on prior studies, no published study has utilized these screens in the sequence outlined above. © ronan coy, kathryn cormican, 2014."
"the goal of this paper is to analyze the impact of annual earnings announcements on the market through the order flow data in addition to the usual transaction data. in this respect, examining order flow data can potentially reveal valuable information that is not available from transaction data. in fact, the data allow us to test hypotheses about asymmetric information and investor behavior and to test if the behavior varies with investor sophistication. in addition, the paper tries to identify the determinants of the impact on a firm's value using assumptions about investor behavior. © 2014 copyright the institute of behavioral finance."
"recent research suggests that the stock market reacts to stale information if it is reported in the media because it is gives the impression of being ""new"" news. the objective of this study is to provide a unique test of this hypothesis using the time-series properties of quarterly earnings. it is well documented that seasonally differenced quarterly earnings for adjacent quarters are positively correlated. therefore a component of current quarter earnings when reported is news that was known or predictable at the end of the prior quarter and thus is old news. we find for those firms that receive media coverage in the wall street journal and the new york times that the price reaction at the time of the announcement of current earnings to past quarter's seasonally differenced quarterly earnings is greater than those firms that do not receive media coverage. the result is consistent with stale earnings information being given the appearance of new information resulting in a further price reaction. this suggests that the stale information hypothesis and media coverage could be a partial explanation for post-earnings announcement drift. © 2014 copyright the institute of behavioral finance."
"customer activity and turnover is a critical component in measuring profitability and market performance. understanding customer behavior is a vital in examining firms the marketplace. the purpose of this study is to examine of the use of marketing analytics to measure customer behavior in small business enterprises (sme). the study used three hypotheses to guide the direction of the research. building on key theoretical concepts grounded in accounting, finance and marketing literature, this study used analytics to measure both customer behavior and firm behavior patterns. this study examined three significant marketing analytics: (a) customer behavior analytics (customer turnover/frequency; velocity of profit/payment for services); (b) marketing behavior analytics (potential of product/services; economic conditions); and economic behavior analytics (pricing adjustment; market barriers). a random sample (n = 198) of businesses were examined for the study. a quantitative methodology was used to examine data collected from the businesses. the results were calculated using a discriminant analysis and a pearson's correlation. based on the results of the study, the marketing behavior analytic proved to be moderately significant in predicting customer behavioral patterns."
"economic and behavioral theories arrive at different conclusions about the effect of being allowed to borrow from one's defined-contribution (dc) retirement plan on people's contributions to dc plans. traditional life-cycle models unambiguously suggest that the borrowing option makes people better off than not being able to borrow. households consequently contribute more to their dc plans than they would absent the borrowing option. previous research finds that the ability to borrow from a dc plan increases contemporaneous contributions, consistent with traditional models. behavioral finance, in contrast, suggests that some workers may operate with nonlinear time discounting. they plan on saving more in the future but change their mind and save less than initially planned as time passes. these workers may enjoy higher lifetime utility if they have no loan option because dc plans serve as commitment devices for retirement saving. the money cannot be used prior to retirement. absent this commitment device, contributions may be lower for some households than would be the case without a dc loan option. we study dc plan contributions for households with heterogeneous preferences about discounting. we separate households into those that demonstrate inconsistent (or paradoxical) borrowing behavior, which may reflect nonlinear time discounting, and those with more consistent borrowing behavior. we find that a dc loan option raises current savings, but does so more for households with consistent borrowing behavior than for those with inconsistent borrowing behavior. © the author(s) 2013."
"using smooth transition regression model analysis, we examine the non-linear predictability of japanese and us stock market returns by a set of macroeconomic variables between 1981 and 2012. the theoretical basis for investigating non-linear behavior in stock returns can be based on the interaction between noise traders and arbitrageurs or behavioral finance theories of non-linear risk aversion. as heterogeneity in investors' beliefs gives reason to suspect a smooth transition between extremes, rather than abrupt, a smooth transition regression model is estimated. our findings support differences in non-linearity of stock returns in japan and the us that might be linked to different shareownership of the japanese stock market compared to the us. in addition, differences in the legal system might have some influence over our findings as well. the us results also suggest greater heterogeneity in the relationship between stock returns and macro variables in the us data relative to the japanese data. the reasons behind the differences in our results, both between countries and between regimes are probably due to the different economic conditions faced by japan and the us over our sample, to the possible existence of bubbles in the data and to investor behavior consistent with 'behavioral finance' theories of investor behavior. © andreas humpe, peter macmillan, 2014."
"the paper provides a theoretical study on efficient market hypothesis (emh) changes under the influence of behavioral finance. authors of the paper briefly provide the basic assumptions of efficient markets theory and remind how the top of its dominance was reached in the 1970s. at the same time the goal of the paper is to develop the unbiased and complex overview of the today's market efficiency and show its transformations under the impact of market participants' irrationality. in the paper authors introduce the interaction between market efficiency, market arbitrage, irrationality of market participants and highlight the importance to revise the reliability of efficient market theory assumptions in order to achieve high performance of investment portfolios. through the behavioral finance point of view authors not only aggregate the critics emh faces during the recent years, but also evaluate today's opportunities for arbitrage and provide arbitrage critics. according to documented by experimental economists departures from market efficiency and taking into consideration their nature, i.e. investors' irrationality as a result of influence of a set of specific behavioral (both cognitive and emotional) biases, an alternative to emh approach called ""the adaptive markets hypothesis"" espoused by andrew lo in 2004 is introduced. the supporters of the emh have responded to these challenges by arguing that, while behavioral biases and corresponding inefficiencies do exist from time to time, there is a limit to their prevalence and impact because of opposing forces dedicated to exploiting such opportunities. finally, basic financial market anomalies are presented in the paper as an example of market inefficiency. on the one hand, their persistence in the face of public scrutiny seems to be a clear violation of the emh. on the other-most of these anomalies can be exploited by relatively simple trading strategies, and, while the resulting profits may not be riskless, they seem usually profitable relative to their risks. summing up of the investigation presented in the paper, authors conclude that many classical emh supporters set the cases theoretically without empirical or real measurement analysis. therefore the discussion on emh is still on-going, but real market analysis should be done instead of evolving emh theoretical evaluation models, which remain theoretical and do not always work properly in the conditions of real financial market."
"the market as a mind is the implicit premise in any discussion on whether the market is rational or not. still, its implications, in terms of ontology and epistemology, are hardly understood. in particular, this paper defines the market's version of the mind-body problem and labels it as finance's ""hard"" problem. its denial by modern finance causes this dominant paradigm to fail in dealing with reality in general and to produce incomplete investment knowledge in particular. finally, as part of facing up to this problem, this paper offers a glimpse at a practical approach which may enrich investment research. © 2014 copyright the institute of behavioral finance."
"drawing on recent empirical research, we study whether the international business cycle, as measured in terms of the output gaps of the g7 countries, has out-of-sample predictive power for gold-price fluctuations. to this end, we use a real-time forecasting approach that accounts for model uncertainty and model instability. we find some evidence that the international business cycle has predictive power for gold-price fluctuations. after accounting for transaction costs, a simple trading rule that builds on real-time out-of-sample forecasts does not lead to a superior performance relative to a buy-and-hold strategy. we also suggest a behavioral-finance approach to study the quality of out-of-sample forecasts from the perspective of forecasters with potentially asymmetric loss functions. © 2014 the board of trustees of the university of illinois."
"numerous studies have analyzed the movements of the s&p 500 index using several methodologies such as technical analysis, econometric modeling, time series techniques and theories from behavioral finance. in this paper we take a novel approach. we use daily closing prices for the s&p 500 index for a very long period from 1/3/1950 to 7/19/2011 for a total of 15,488 daily observations. we then investigate the up and down movements and their combinations for 1-7 days giving us multiple possible patterns for over six decades. some patterns of each type are more dominant across decades. we split the data into training and validation sets and then select the dominant patterns to build conditional forecasts in several ways, including using a decision tree methodology. the best model is correct 51 % of the time on the validation set when forecasting a down day, and 61 % when forecasting an up day. we show that certain conditional forecasts outperform the unconditional random walk model. © 2013 springer-verlag berlin heidelberg."
"finance, while largely emerging out of economics, has tended to overlook its own intellectual history. perhaps because of this lack of attention to its intellectual history, an important connection between two important schools of thought, one in finance (behavioral finance) and the other in economics (institutional economics), appears to have been largely overlooked. the parallels between the two schools of thought are striking. institutionalism arose in opposition to the orthodoxy of mainstream microeconomic though being developed by such neoclassical economists as jevons (1871) and marshall (1890). institutionalism rejected the idea of universal economic ""laws"" or theoretical systems. rather, its adherents argued that economic behavior was hugely influenced by the participant's historical, social and institutional context. according to these adherents, understanding such behavior required an interdisciplinary approach. mainstream finance's basic modern portfolio theory model began with markowitz's classic 1952 article. in the next twenty years the capital asset pricing model (capm) took shape. behavioral finance is said to trace its roots back to a 1972 article by slovic. behavioral finance arose as an attempt to explain apparent inconsistencies between orthodox finance theory and real world financial market behavior. clearly both institutionalists and behavioralists are operating outside of the main stream of their discipline. both believe that their view of reality is more realistic than that of the mainstream models. both can cite a host of theoretical and empirical evidence to support their viewpoint. both argue for a multidimensional (especially psychological) approach. both see the mainstream approach as too simplistic. both are criticized by the mainstream for their ad hoc approach and lack of a central theoretical model. © 2013 elsevier b.v."

"with the rapid growth of mobile network, tablets and smart phones have become sorts of keys to access personal secured services in our daily life. people use these devices to manage personal finances, shop on the internet, and even pay at vending machines. besides, it also helps us get connected with friends and business partners through social network applications, which were widely used as personal identifications in both real and virtual societies. however, these devices use inherently weak authentication mechanism, based upon passwords and pins that is not changed all the time. although forcing users to change password periodically can enhance the security level, it may also be considered annoyances for users. biometric technologies are straightforward because of the simple authentication process. however, most of the traditional biometrics methodologies require diverse equipment to acquire biometric information, which may be expensive and not portable. this paper proposes a multibiometric user authentication scheme with both physiological and behavioral biometrics. only simple rotations with fingers on multitouch devices are required to enhance the security level without annoyances for users. in addition, the user credential is replaceable to prevent from the privacy leakage. © 2014 chorng-shiuh koong et al."
"there is a growing consensus that fundamental financial theory based on the assumption that markets are complete is not sustainable when financial markets become increasingly complex. traditional models fail to capture many of the stylized facts and biases identified by recent financial developments that have sought to explain financial prices when markets are incomplete. these approaches, and in particular behavioral finance, in turn, do not formalize and quantify the assumptions their approaches are based on, which are required for financial calculations and assets pricing. one of the open questions is therefore whether a model exists that is able to deduce the overall equilibrium stated by the current paradigm as a sequence of balancing disequilibria. to this aim, a class of stochastic models-the multifractional processes-is suggested and presented in this paper. multifractional processes are defined as a generalization of fractional brownian motion, providing a parsimonious mechanisms for modeling real financial markets. this approach includes temporary departures from equilibrium triggered by investors' biases. © 2014 - ios press and the authors."
"dynamic portfolio choice is an important problem in finance, but the optimal strategy analysis is difficult when considering multiple stochastic volatility variables such as the stock price, interest rate, and income. besides, recent research in experimental economics indicates that the agent shows limited attention, considering only the variables with high fluctuations but ignoring those with small ones. by extending the sparse max method, we propose an approach to solve dynamic programming problem with small stochastic volatility and the agent's bounded rationality. this approach considers the agent's behavioral factors and avoids effectively the ""curse of dimensionality"" in a dynamic programming problem with more than a few state variables. we then apply it to merton dynamic portfolio choice model with stochastic volatility and get a tractable solution. finally, the numerical analysis shows that the bounded rational agent may pay no attention to the varying equity premium and interest rate with small variance. © 2014 wenjie bi et al."

"this article studies behavioral responses to taxes in financial markets. it is motivated by recent puzzling empirical evidence of taxable municipal bond yields significantly exceeding the level expected relative to tax exempt bonds. a behavioral explanation is a tax aversion bias, the phenomenon that people perceive an additional burden associated with tax payments. we conduct market experiments on the trading of differently taxed and labeled securities. the data show an initial overvaluation of tax payments that diminishes when subjects gain experience. the tax deduction of expenses is valued more than an equivalent tax exemption of earnings. we find that the persistence of the tax aversion bias critically depends on the quality of feedback. this suggests that tax aversion predominantly occurs in one-time, unfamiliar financial decisions and to a lesser extent in repetitive choices. © 2014 © the institute of behavioral finance."
"kabbalah and itstree of life integrate the cognitive, behavioral/emotional and action levels of human existence, explaining the relations between these and their unity. this makes it an ideal framework for behavioral economics and finance where cognitive and emotional biases and heuristics play a central role. in burstein and negoita [9], we began to develop a kabbalah system theory, modeling the tree of life as a hierarchical three level feedback control system corresponding to the cognitive, behavioral/emotional and action levels. we will further develop this here by focusing on system dynamics, in order to create a kabbalah system theory modeling framework for a knowledge based behavioral economics and finance. in this new framework, emotional intelligence theory [19–21, 40] and polanyi personal tacit/explicit knowledge theory [36, 37] are used to model the emotional and cognitive level processes. here we are connecting these theorieswith behavioral economics and finance. while behavioral finance focuses on the impact of knowledge/cognition and emotional factors, the intrinsic dynamics of these factors is not considered in depth. this is why behavioral economics and finance can benefit from integrating emotional intelligence and knowledge theory in theirmodeling. ourkabbalah system theory creates the modeling framework for that. in particular, it allows connecting the recent knowledge based economic theory attempts with behavioral economics in a unified knowledge based behavioral economics. we apply this in particular to kabbalah behavioral, knowledge based asset pricing modeling. © springer international publishing switzerland 2014."

"mainstream accounting and finance literature is upholding an image of humans who make rational decisions by evaluating risks and returns of all available alternatives. it traditionally transformed humans into economic subjects who will rationally weight advantage against disadvantage and rigidly pursue their own interests. these characteristics of human decision making are incorporated in the concept of homo economicus, which significantly impacted the way accounting and finance theory has been developed. the objective of this chapter is to critically discuss the concept of the homo economicus and its application in accounting and finance research, based on findings from behavioral economics. specifically, it shows that (1) humans rely on heuristics and biases for decision making, and (2) that the information which participants on financial markets are supposed to interpret for their decision making is not neutral, unbiased and value-free. the chapter argues that both accounting and finance research could be enhanced by methods and findings from behavioral economics. © 2013 nova science publishers, inc."
"we combine new developments in decision theory with a standard consumption-based asset-pricing framework. in our model the efficient market hypothesis is violated if and only if agents' beliefs express ambiguity about the stochastic process driving economic fundamentals. asset price fluctuations result because agents with ambiguous beliefs are prone to a confirmatory bias in the interpretation of new information. we demonstrate that our approach gives rise to price-patterns of ""underreaction"" and ""overreaction"" to news about dividend payments. although these empirical phenomena have received significant attention in the behavioral finance literature, we argue that our decision-theoretic underpinning of psychological attitudes has a less ad hoc flavor than existing approaches. © 2012 springer-verlag."

"overconfidence is often regarded as one of the most prevalent judgment biases. several studies show that overconfidence can lead to suboptimal decisions of investors, managers, or politicians. recent research, however, questions whether overconfidence should be regarded as a bias and shows that standard ""overconfidence"" findings can easily be explained by different degrees of knowledge of agents plus a random error in predictions. we contribute to the current literature and ongoing research by extensively analyzing interval estimates for knowledge questions, for real financial time series, and for artificially generated charts. we thereby suggest a new method to measure overconfidence in interval estimates, which is based on the implied probability mass behind a stated prediction interval. we document overconfidence patterns, which are difficult to reconcile with rationality of agents and which cannot be explained by differences in knowledge as differences in knowledge do not exist in our task. furthermore, we show that overconfidence measures are reliable in the sense that there exist stable individual differences in the degree of overconfidence in interval estimates, thereby testing an important assumption of behavioral economics and behavioral finance models: stable individual differences in the degree of overconfidence across people. we do this in a ""field experiment,"" for different levels of expertise of subjects (students on the one hand and professional traders and investment bankers on the other hand), over time, by using different miscalibration metrics, and for tasks that avoid common weaknesses such as a non-representative selection of trick questions. © 2012 john wiley & sons, ltd."
"this two-part article proposes using integral theory as the foundation of a more sus-tainable investing practice, named here integral investing. this evolving investment concept, which crystallized over the past two decades in my personal investing practice, is a condensation of sev-eral papers presented at various finance, economics, and sustainability conferences. part 1 sup-ports the proposal through investigations performed on 1) current investing structures, 2) global initiatives and trends, and 3) 132 leading-edge individual investors who have apparently evolved to later stages of human development. this research is revealed using joseph campbell's conception of the hero's journey. based on the integral framework, part 2 of the article introduces a possible path toward a more sustainable investing practice that is based on evolution and the essence of all existence, considering interior as well as exterior realities. in this model, financial returns must be inseparable from a deep impact on the social, environmental, cultural, and behavioral aspects of reality as well as human development and evolution."
"behavioral finance is a new approach in finance literature. the main idea is that investors are not as rational as they are assumed to be. therefore, financial markets could be better understood by using models that capture the effects of both rational and irrational investors. the critics of behavioral finance could be grouped into two main categories: limits of arbitrage and psychological factors. this chapter concentrates on both challenges and possible contributions of behavioral finance theory to the modern finance theory, which is mainly based on rational expectations theory and efficient market hypothesis. © 2014 by igi global. all rights reserved."
"behavioral finance shows the impact of psychology on the behavior of individuals and is important to study because it shows the main factors behind market inefficiency. individual investors of the stock market are therefore thought to take rational decisions while making judgments and investment decision. the empirical evidences of previous studies conclude that the involvement of behavioral biases and psychological impacts on investor's judgments and decision making that leads investors towards irrational decision making. overall discussion in previous studies conclude the presence of behavioral biases in decision making process of investors. all the previous literature that is available has concluded contradictory results so far on the impact of fear and anger on individual investor's judgment and decision making. keeping this in mind the present study has focused on exploring the real impact of affect heuristic, fear and anger on individual investor's judgments and decision making considering the present scenario in pakistan. the population of present study was the individual investors trading all over the three stock exchanges of pakistan. a survey method was conducted with thirty four items to gather the data from 270 investors investing in islamabad stock exchange. confirmatory factor analysis is used to measure the validity of three determinants of individual investor investment decision making. © idosi publications, 2013."
"objective: this study investigated the effect of verbal prompting on elders' 10-year longitudinal change in everyday cognition. differential effects of prompting associated with impaired cognitive status were also examined. method: at baseline, 2,802 participants (mean age = 73.6 years, mean education = 13.5 years) from the advanced cognitive training for independent and vital elderly trial were classified as unimpaired, having amnestic mild cognitive impairment (mci) or nonamnestic mci, based on psychometric algorithm. participants were given the observed tasks of daily living (otdl; a behavioral measure with tasks involving medication management/finances/telephone use) at baseline and at 1-, 2-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year follow-ups. when participants said ""i don't know"" or did not respond to an item, they received a standardized verbal prompt. at each occasion, unprompted (sum of items correct without prompting) and prompted (sum of items correct including both prompted and unprompted) scores were derived for each participant. multilevel modeling, adjusting for demographics/health/training group, was used to determine the trajectories of otdl performance. results: persons with mci performed at lower levels than those who were unimpaired (amnestic < nonamnestic < unimpaired), and for all groups, prompted performance exceeded unprompted in all years. there was differential performance of the prompting conditions over time; prompted performance, unlike unprompted, was relatively protected from age-related decline, and persons with mci experienced greater improvement due to prompting. conclusions: very simple prompting appears to enhance and maintain performance on a task of everyday cognition over 10 years for both unimpaired and mildly impaired older adults. © 2013 american psychological association."

"we find consistent value and momentum return premia across eight diverse markets and asset classes, and a strong common factor structure among their returns. value and momentum returns correlate more strongly across asset classes than passive exposures to the asset classes, but value and momentum are negatively correlated with each other, both within and across asset classes. our results indicate the presence of common global risks that we characterize with a three-factor model. global funding liquidity risk is a partial source of these patterns, which are identifiable only when examining value and momentum jointly across markets. our findings present a challenge to existing behavioral, institutional, and rational asset pricing theories that largely focus on u.s. equities. © 2013 the american finance association."

"for the better part of the last four decades academic research has focused on stock return predictability explained by asset pricing models. financial economists approach finance theory by focusing on whether to reject a pricing model based on hypothesis tests. however, this approach often fails to capture aspects of the model and latent information in the data that could be potentially useful to the investor. owing to these limitations, investors have increasingly turned to high-frequency trading as a means of achieving risk-mitigated wealth appreciation. high frequency trading is a strategy that relies on professional proprietary formula-driven trading algorithms to execute millisecond trades using high-speed computers that are placed near or in the proximity of the exchanges to reduce order latency time. the contemporary impact of this new approach has increased the speed and complexity of trading, and has had an impact on market liquidity and transparency. in turn, this has attracted the attention of regulators who are ""clamping down on rapid trades in the stock market"" [3] and the risk of such trades to create volatility by flooding the market with orders before canceling these same orders in fractions of seconds. facing the possibility of regulatory oversight, many highfrequency automated traders are now turning to the alternative of near high-frequency trading. instead of focusing on strategies to implement strategic runs in the millisecondenvironment, using the highest resolution data available, near high-frequency trading solves complex econometric models on an instrument by instrument basis to predict the profitability of a future trade. in this paper we present a theory of stochastic price formation to form a behavioral near high frequency automated trading system. the new system is actuated by a combining dual radial basis function artificial neural networks and two fundamental trading metrics. additionally, because the trading signals are generated by cognitive models, the research calibrates a nonparametric behavioral production function to estimate the quasi elasticity coefficients of a four factor model. © 2013 by nova science publishers, inc. all rights reserved."
"the aim of this paper is to analyze the return and risk of different categories of funds managed using non-conventional management criteria, in order to test which achieve a better performance. three periods, two bullish phases and one bearish phase, were analyzed. three categories of non-conventional investment funds were examined: socially responsible investment funds, funds based on the principles of behavioral finance, and finally the vice fund, applying a medium-difference analysis and a multivariate analysis along with the sharpe ratio and information ratio. no significant differences were found between the returns of the three categories, except as regards their volatility. using the estimated multivariate model it was not possible to get significant differences between the three categories of funds or the market index in most cases. ratio analysis enabled us to establish a fund ranking, but was unable to show which management was the most appropriate throughout the different periods. © 2011 acede."

"opponents of the efficient markets hypothesis argue that predictability reflects the psychological factors and ""fads"" of irrational investors in a speculative market. in that, conventional time series analysis often fails to give an accurate forecast for financial processes due to inherent noise patterns, fat tails, and nonlinear components. a recent stream of literature on behavioral finance has revealed that boundedly rational agents using simple rules of thumb for their decisions under uncertainty provides a more realistic description of human behavior than perfect rationality with optimal decision rules. consequently, the application of technical analysis in trading could produce high returns. machine learning techniques have been employed in economic systems in modeling nonlinearities and simulating human behavior. in this study, we expand the literature that evaluates return sign forecasting ability by introducing a recurrent neural network approach that combines heuristic learning and short-term memory emulation, thus mimicking the decision-making process of boundedly rational agents. we investigate the relative direction-of-change predictability of the neural network structure implied by the lee-white-granger test as well as compare it to other well-established models for the djia index. moreover, we examine the relationship between stock return volatility and returns. overall, the proposed model presents high profitability, in particular during ""bear"" market periods. © 2013 elsevier inc."
"aim: to investigate factors associated with caregiver burden (cb) in persons caring for older adults with various cognitive stages of alzheimer's disease (ad). methods: participants were 1127 outpatients and their caregivers. participants comprised 120 older adults with normal cognition (nc), 126 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (amci) and 881 with ad. ad patients were subclassified into four groups by mini-mental state examination (mmse) score: ad29-24 (n=117), ad23-18 (n=423), ad17-12 (n=254) and ad11-0 (n=87). participants and their caregivers underwent comprehensive geriatric assessment batteries including zarit burden interview (zbi) barthel index, lawton index, dementia behavior disturbance scale (dbd) to evaluate cb, instrumental and basic activity of daily living (iadl/badl), and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (bpsd). the comorbidity of geriatric syndrome and the living situation of the patient/caregiver were also assessed. results: zbi score was higher in patients with lower mmse score. multivariate regression analysis identified that dbd was consistently associated with cb in all patients; symptoms related to memory deficit were related to cb in amci; differential iadl, such as inability to use a telephone, use transportation, manage finances, shop, cook and take responsibility for own medication, were related to cb in ad29-24, ad23-18 and ad17-12, and geriatric syndrome including falls and motor disturbance, sleep problems, urinary incontinence, and fatigue was related to cb in ad23-18 and ad17-12. conclusions: multiple factors including bpsd, impaired life function and geriatric syndrome were cognitive stage-dependently associated with cb. preventive treatment of bpsd and comorbidity, and effective assistance for iadl deficits could contribute to alleviation of cb. © 2014 japan geriatrics society."
"this work deals with the issue of investors' irrational behavior and financial products' misperception. the theoretical analysis of the mechanisms driving erroneous assessment of investment performances is explored. the study is supported by the application of monte carlo simulations to the remarkable case of structured financial products. some motivations explaining the popularity of these complex financial instruments among retail investors are also provided. in particular, investors are assumed to compare the performances of different projects through stochastic dominance rules. unreasonably and in contrast with results obtained by the application of the selected criteria, investors prefer complex securities to standard ones. in this paper, introducing a new definition for stochastic dominance which presents asymmetric property, we provide theoretical and numerical results showing how investors distort stochastic returns and make questionable investment choices. results are explained in terms of framing and representative effects, which are behavioral finance type arguments showing how decisions may depend on the way the available alternatives are presented to investors. © 2012 springer science+business media b.v."
"existing studies on stock return forecasting mainly formulate the issue in a numeric analysis framework. various kinds of time series models and optimization methods are applied. in this paper, we explore a new prediction approach based on the behavior of analysts' recommendations. by combining each recommendation and stock return, a posterior probability model associated with an analyst's recommendation is built based on bayesian inference. it provides an estimation of stock return distribution for next several days after recommendation, and thus serves as a novel predictor from point of view of behavioral finance. based on the empirical studies on china stock market, we demonstrate the superior forecasting performance over traditional methods. the model's maximum accuracy can be reached between 84.3% and 94.2%. the average accuracy falls between 58.6% and 60.3%, while it is just from 43.5% to 56.2% or lower by traditional prediction methods. we also find that most of the analysts can produce recommendations which fitness lies between 0.5 and 0.6 at the successive recommendation time. the finding is in accordance with early conclusion which indicates that stock analysts tend to maintain their reputation when they issue recommendations. the consistency also confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2013 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved."
"we draw on the psychology literature on cross-country cultural differences to explain the information content of stock markets around the world. we show that cultural dimensions in the studies of hofstede (1980, 2001) such as individualism and uncertainty avoidance closely relate to several behavioral biases widely discussed in accounting and finance research. these cultural dimensions also signal different risk preferences. we argue that behavioral biases and risk preferences influence how international investors act on firm-specific information and empirically test whether individualism and uncertainty avoidance indexes can explain the cross-country information content of stock markets. we compute r2 from the market model to measure the general information content of stock markets in the long term, abnormal return variance, and abnormal trading volume around earnings announcements to measure the short-term information content of earnings announcements. using more than 150,000 earnings announcements from 42 countries for the period 1990-2006, we find that the information content of stock markets is higher in more individualistic countries and in low uncertainty-avoiding countries. the relations between cultural dimensions and measures of information content are robust to the inclusion of several control variables or the use of updated cultural indexes that account for possible changes in cultures over time. © 2013 elsevier b.v."
"this study utilizes the overall reclassification of industries policy to explore the postannouncement performance from a behavioral finance perspective. the presentation framing of the biotechnology and medical care industry is one with certainty prospects. this suggests that investors tend to buy more of these stocks because the government emphasizes the importance of this industry since 2002, which induces a significantly positive price effect. however, the reclassified eight electronic-related industries reveal presentation framings with uncertainty prospects. the heterogeneity of the high-technology industry thus leaves investors less tendency to hold these stocks and in turn a negative price effect. this paper shows some evidence and implication, suggesting a link between the presentation framing of industries and investors' behavior. © the institute of behavioral finance."
"this study employs accounting statements, a source of information consistently available to the markets, to study the role of firm fundamentals and investor sentiment in formulating equity prices. we document that while investors use economic factors to price assets, its importance varies significantly over time and other non-economic factors also play a role. we find that during the ""dot.com"" years of the late 1990s, investors were optimistic and relied less on underlying financial information in valuing equity, and this effect was most pronounced for nasdaq-listed firms. the ""correction"" that began in march 2000 led to an increase in the use of accounting data in price formulation over the next two years. however, the enactment of sox in 2002 had a much greater impact of enhancing the relevance of accounting information, thereby achieving the intended goal of increasing investors' reliance of fundamentals in stock valuation. we also observe a fall in the role of accounting statements in equity pricing during the 2007 financial crisis, suggesting that reduction in stock prices largely resulted from a changes in investor sentiment and economic conditions rather than declining firm fundamentals. we also find no evidence that the accounting scandals and frauds occurring between 1998 and 2001 had a measurable impact on accounting relevance, suggesting that market efficiency prevented a contagion impact on other firms. our results suggest that equity valuation is not driven solely by fundamentals, but also by sentiment and behavioral factors which impact share pricing. © 2013, banking and finance review."
"recent evidence for the us indicates that momentum profits are conditional on market dynamics. this paper documents that the following finding holds for the japanese market as well: momentum returns are significantly higher when the market stays in the same condition than when it transitions to the other state. this evidence is consistent with the behavioral model of daniel etal. (, journal of finance 53(6), 1839-1885.). furthermore, market transitions occurred more frequently in japan compared to the us. these results explain why average momentum returns have historically been low in japan, a fact generally referred to as an empirical failure of momentum. overall, my findings indicate that different market dynamics, and not different momentum, cause the overall low momentum returns in japan. © 2014 international review of finance ltd. 2014."

"this introductory text is devoted to exposing the underlying nature of price formation in financial markets as a predominantly sociological phenomenon that relates individual decision-making to emergent and co-evolving social and financial structures. two different levels of this sociological influence are considered: first, we examine how price formation results from the social dynamics of interacting individuals, where interaction occurs either through the price or by direct communication. then the same processes are revisited and examined at the level of larger groups of individuals. in this book, models of both levels of socio-finance are presented, and it is shown, in particular, how complexity theory provides the conceptual and methodological tools needed to understand and describe such phenomena. accordingly, readers are first given a broad introduction to the standard economic theory of rational financial markets and will come to understand its shortcomings with the help of concrete examples. complexity theory is then introduced in order to properly account for behavioral decision-making and match the observed market dynamics. this book is conceived as a primer for newcomers to the field, as well as for practitioners seeking new insights into the field of complexity science applied to socio-economic systems in general, and financial markets and price formation in particular. © 2013 springer-verlag berlin heidelberg. all rights are reserved."
"this paper examines the effects of aggregate government payments to nonprofit organizations on aggregate private philanthropy. four behavioral models of private philanthropic giving are proposed to formulate four hypotheses about those effects: no net effect (null hypothesis), crowding in (positive effect), crowding out (negative effect), and ""philanthropic flight"" or displacement (negative effect across different subsectors). these hypotheses were tested against the evidence from 40 countries collected as a part of a larger research project aimed to document the scale and finances of the nonprofit sector. the data show that, on the balance, government payments to nonprofit institutions (npis) have a positive effect on aggregate philanthropic donations to nonprofits, as stipulated by the crowding in hypothesis, but a field level analysis revealed evidence of ""philanthropic flight"" or displacement from ""service"" to ""expressive"" activities by government payments to ""service"" npis. due to the limitations of the data, these results indicate empirical plausibility of the hypothesized effects rather than their incidence. the findings demonstrate the complexity of the relationship between government funding and philanthropic donations to nonprofits, which depends on the goals of the actors (donors and recipients) and institutional settings mediating the transaction costs of difference sources of nonprofit support. © 2012 international society for third-sector research and the john's hopkins university."
"we examine the long-run stock and operating performance of firms issuing underwriter warrants. using matched samples, we found significant long-run underperformance of seasoned equity offerings (seos) with warrant compensation, relative to seos with cash compensation, following offering announcements. profitability measures of firms issuing underwriter warrants are also significantly lower over the post-offering period. in sharp contrast to these results, growth measures of warrant-issuing firms are greater for both pre- and post-offering periods. combined together, our results suggest that underwriter warrants are offered in a way to take advantage of the higher growth potential of issuing firms in the short term, whose growth trend is, however, transitory and not materialized into higher stock or operating performance over the long-run, post-offering period. we interpret our results as suggesting that the certification effect of seos with warrant compensation through growth signaling does not last in the long run. we further offer a behavioral approach as explanations of the short-run outperformance of seo firms with warrant compensation with empirical evidence supporting the miller's divergence of opinion hypothesis. © 2013 international review of finance ltd. 2013."

"interest in corporate tax reform that lowers the rate and broadens the base has developed in the past several years. some discussions by economists in opinion pieces have suggested there is an urgent need to lower the corporate tax rate, but not necessarily to broaden the tax base, an approach that presents some difficulties given current budget pressures. others see the corporate tax as a potential source of revenue. arguments for lowering the corporate tax rate include the traditional concerns about economic distortions arising from the corporate tax and newer concerns arising from the increasingly global nature of the economy. some claims have been made that lowering the corporate tax rate would raise revenue because of the behavioral responses, an effect that is linked to an open economy. although the corporate tax has generally been viewed as contributing to a more progressive tax system because the burden falls on capital income and thus on higher income individuals, claims have also been made that the burden falls not on owners of capital, but on labor income-an effect also linked to an open economy. the analysis in this report suggests that many of the concerns expressed about the corporate tax are not supported by empirical data. claims that behavioral responses could cause revenues to rise if rates were cut do not hold up on either a theoretical basis or an empirical basis. studies that purport to show a revenue maximizing corporate tax rate of 30% (a rate lower than the current statutory tax rate) contain econometric errors that lead to biased and inconsistent results; when those problems are corrected the results disappear. cross-country studies to provide direct evidence showing that the burden of the corporate tax actually falls on labor yield unreasonable results and prove to suffer from econometric flaws that also lead to a disappearance of the results when corrected, in those cases where data were obtained and the results replicated. similarly, claims that high u.s. tax rates will create problems for the united states in a global economy suffer from a misrepresentation of the u.s. tax rate compared to other countries and are less important when capital is imperfectly mobile, as it appears to be. although these new arguments appear to rely on questionable methods, the traditional concerns about the corporate tax appear valid. while an argument may be made that the tax is still needed as a backstop to individual tax collections, it does result in some economic distortions. these economic distortions, however, have declined substantially over time as corporate rates and shares of output have fallen. moreover, it is difficult to lower the corporate tax without creating a way of sheltering individual income given the low rates of tax on dividends and capital gains. a number of revenue-neutral changes are available that could reduce these distortions, allow for a lower corporate statutory tax rate, and lead to a more efficient corporate tax system. these changes include base broadening, reducing the benefits of debt finance through inflation indexing, and reducing the tax at the firm level offset by an increase at the individual level. nevertheless, the scope for reducing the tax in a revenue neutral way may be limited. © 2013 by nova science publishers, inc. all rights reserved."

"this chapter studies the quantitative evolution of sub-central sovereign debt in spain over the period 2000-2011 and compares it with the evolution of central debt. as an intense process of political and fiscal decentralization has taken place since the mid eighties, the paper examines whether this drive to decentralization has been paralleled by any fiscally undisciplined behavior on the part of spanish sub-central governments over the period considered. some key formal legal rules and informal behavioral norms present at sub-central politics in spain are examined, including legal controls on borrowing by sub-central governments. the empirical analysis will be based on the internationally comparable public finance figures provided by sources such as the oecd, the eurostat and the bank of spain. the paper concludes that economic performance seem to be the key factor for explaining the evolution of sub-central, as well as central, public debt before and after the world financial crash. the analysis shows that in terms of the spanish gdp the debt burden generated by sub-central governments in spain decreased over the 2000-2007 period. however, this debt has soared from 8.5 per cent of spanish gdp in 2007 to 16.4 per cent in 2011, adding 85 thousand millions euros (about 106 billions us dollars) to the stock of total public debt in spain in just four years. central government added 267 thousand millions euros (about 334 billions us dollars). © 2013 springer-verlag berlin heidelberg. all rights are reserved."
"practitioners and academics have spent the past few decades debating the validity and relevance of the capital asset pricing model (capm). one of the attributes of the model is an estimate of risk by beta, which in equilibrium describe the behavior of mean-variance (mv) investors. in the mv framework, risk is measured by the variance of returns which is a questionable and restrictive risk measure. in contrast, the average drawdown risk is a more acceptable risk measure and can be applied to modeling an alternative behavioral hypothesis, namely mean-drawdown behavior with a replacement risk measure for diversified investors, the average drawdown beta leading to an alternative pricing model based on this beta. our findings clearly support the average drawdown beta and the pricing model of average drawdown capm versus the conventional beta and capm in a sample of malaysian mutual funds. © 2013 world scientific publishing co. and center for pacific basin business, economics and finance research."
"this paper aims to motivate competition versus traditional organization of electricity industry, in term of efficient markets theory. efficient markets theory has been called to justify that in developed electricity markets that have good regulation, market makers and enough transparency, depth and liquidity, prices reflect the fair value of the good. descriptive and technical analyses applied to european electricity market prices strengthen our enthusiasm about efficient markets theory and about the fact that market prices should be preferred to regulated prices. the paper underlies the role that regulation could play in every market and particularly in electricity markets. we motivate this element in terms of behavioral finance and human psychology. © 2013 ieee."
"behavioral finance researchers have been increasingly interested in the links between individual investors' subjective perceptions about companies and their stock investment decisions. this article aims to provide a systematic examination of how investors' subjective and affective evaluations of companies' products and brands, in particular, may influence investors' propensities to consider those companies as investment targets. the author hypothesizes the effects by applying psychological consumer behavior theories and tests the hypotheses with data gathered from 292 individual investors. the results show that the personal relevance that an investor attaches to a particular company's product domain decreases the consideration that the investor gives to alternative investment targets, while investing in that company's stock. the investor's affective evaluation of the company's product brand has a similar effect. moreover, the results show that an investor's affective evaluation of a company's brand increases his optimism about the financial returns of the company's stock. finally, the results suggest that contrary to what might be expected, an investor's familiarity with the company's brand does not decrease the consideration that he gives to alternative investment targets, nor is brand familiarity linked to overconfidence about the financial returns of the company's stock. © 2013 copyright taylor and francis group, llc."
"purpose-the purpose of this paper is to systematically profile investors’ personality traits to examine if, and how, those traits are associated with phenomena observed in financial markets. in particular, the paper looks at overconfidence and overreaction in an experimental foreign exchange market. design/methodology/approach-the paper measures the personality of the subjects using the short form of the neo-pir instrument, the neo-ffi developed by costa and mcrae (1992) which is based on norman’s (1963) “big five” personality constructs of negative emotion, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness and conscientiousness. the paper measures psychological gender using questions developed by bem (1994). preference for innovation and risk-taking propensity are measured using instruments developed by jackson (1976). the paper then examines the behavior of the subject who traded interactively in “real time” in an interactive-simulated foreign exchange market where “price discovery” was instantaneous and pricing decisions were made instantaneously as items of news, determined by the researchers, were released. findings-the paper demonstrates that personality traits are associated with overconfidence and overreaction in financial markets. the paper presents meta-analysis which facilitates the development of a posteriori theories of how particular traits affect investment; there are important roles for risktaking propensity, negative emotion, extraversion, masculinity, preference for innovation and conscientiousness. originality/value-a typical behavioral finance paper might find an empirical regularity in prices and, on the basis of such patterns, infer the underlying psychology motivating the behavior of investors. the approach differs from this caricature of the “typical” behavioral finance paper. the paper does not infer the underlying psychology of investors from patterns in prices. rather, the paper learns about investors by systematically profiling their personality traits. the paper then demonstrates how those traits are associated with the prices generated by the investors the authors study. in focussing on the role of individual personality, the paper refocusses behavioral finance on the individuals who set prices. © emerald group publishing limited."
"in this study, the managerial overconfidence theory was used to examine the over-investment phenomenon in anhui listed companies from behavioral corporate finance perspective. the results show that (1) overconfident managers in anhui listed companies tended to make over-investment decision, (2) overconfident managers in anhui listed companies further strengthened the over-investment behavior in the case of having abundant free cash flow and (3) compared with non-soes, overconfident managers in anhui state-owned listed companies were more inclined to over-invest in the case of having abundant free cash flow. © 2013 asian network for scientific information."
"this work focuses on the study of the determinants of capital structure in the context of the ""market timing"" theory in a sample of 20 tunisian firms listed on the tunis stock exchange during the period 2004-2010. the empirical analysis shows that the results are inconclusive regarding the relevance of certain variables from this theoretical framework due to various reasons including market inefficiency. we can also invoke the behavioral dimension of tunisian companies insofar as direct finance is not often the preferred alternative by the agents as well as to those in need financing capacity. © 2013, econjournals. all rights reserved."
"the development of behavioral finance has proposed an outstretched idea for traditional model, that the irrational behavior of venture entrepreneurs and venture capitalists has an important impact on the corporation's investment decision-making. this paper, based on the optimal effort model for double-sided moral hazard, has discussed the influence of the entrepreneurs' and venture capitalists' psychological and emotional factors on the venture enterprise value and the investment decision-making. and it turned out that moderate confidence of entrepreneurs and investors are able to offset the impact of moral hazard. overconfidence of entrepreneurs may lead to lower corporate value, but it may also make the venture enterprise with a negative npv get investment, while overconfidence of investors may cause overreaction in investment decision-making. entrepreneurs' negative and conservative psychology may result in the reduction of firm value, and the venture enterprise with positive net revenue may face the refusal to invest. the venture capitalists' negative and conservative psychology may result in under reaction in the decision-making process. the research is helpful to the decision making when people analyze venture capitalist' and entrepreneurs' decisions under different circumstances of emotional psychology. © 2013 the authors. published by elsevier b.v."
"we extend the market timing literature to show that seo timing can be characterized by the dynamics of liquidity risk. that is, firms tend to issue seos when liquidity risk declines to the point where investors have least concern of the risk. in the absence of liquidity risk, market risk rises right before seos and then gradually falls afterwards, consistent with the q-theory (carlson et al., 2010). however, once we include liquidity risk factor into the model for expected returns, issuing firms' market risk behaves like that of matched non-issuers, suggesting an omitted risk factor problem in seo studies that does not take into account the effect of liquidity risk on stock returns. furthermore, there is no evidence of post-issue long-run underperformance. our results imply that, instead of timing alpha (i.e., exploiting overpricing, as behavioral finance has suggested), issuing firms time liquidity beta to minimize their cost of equity capital. the liquidity beta timing is especially evident in large offer size issuers. © 2012 elsevier b.v."
"in recent years, remarkable progress has been made in behavioral research on a wide variety of topics, from behavioral finance, labor contracts, philanthropy, and the analysis of savings and poverty, to eyewitness identification and sentencing decisions, racism, sexism, health behaviors, and voting. research findings have often been strikingly counterintuitive, with serious implications for public policymaking. in this book, leading experts in psychology, decision research, policy analysis, economics, political science, law, medicine, and philosophy explore major trends, principles, and general insights about human behavior in policy-relevant settings. their work provides a deeper understanding of the many drivers--cognitive, social, perceptual, motivational, and emotional--that guide behaviors in everyday settings. they give depth and insight into the methods of behavioral research, and highlight how this knowledge might influence the implementation of public policy for the improvement of society. © 2013 by princeton university press. all rights reserved."
"this article presents a multitrial experiment that extends the classic experiment of thaler et al. [1997] by adding a high-risk stock fund to the bond and stock funds used in the original experiment. results from the study show that investors allocate the same proportion of their investment to the high-risk stock fund and the stock fund, increasing their investment in the stocks and their expected return. we conducted a similar experiment with all three assets and found no myopic loss aversion. we suggest that high-risk stock funds might reduce the effect of myopic loss aversion. © the institute of behavioral finance."
"in this paper we review the literature on the short term predictability of stock prices conditional on large prior price changes. this research area is characterized by a large number of studies reflecting different markets, time periods, methodologies and model parameters. while most of the papers do find elements of predictability in markets subsequent to large price changes the wide diversity in research approaches makes it very difficult to draw general conclusions from past studies. in addition there is little consensus within the literature regarding the causes of predictability with papers variously favoring explanations based around market microstructure, behavioral anomalies and the response of market participants to changing risk. we identify the key empirical findings from the literature, evaluate the explanations for the cause of the effects, discuss the links of the research program to other areas of finance and finally review possible topics for future research in the area. © 2012 elsevier inc."
"the aim of this paper is to use behavioral finance to explain the factors that brought barclays plc. to face a £290 million fine (about $440 million), having deliberately tried to manipulate the libor (london interbank offered rate). this sums to the £59.5 million fined by the british financial services authority (fsa) - the highest fine ever imposed by this organization - and respectively £102 million and £128 million by the us department of justice and by the commodity futures trading commission (cftc). we analyze the reports issued by the u.s. and the british regulatory agencies, and those of financial analysts. even though the focus of analysis are barclays' actions, we compare them with what other market participants did at the time of the analyzed events, to offer a comprehensive look at the financial industry and its dominant culture. in particular, after describing libor rate determination methodology and the behavior of barclays personnel when violations occurred, we present barclays' failures in organizing its own control systems and establishing a proper corporate culture. finally, we analyze the behavior of market participants and supervisory authority in evaluating barclays' financial and ethical performance."
"population data indicate that 14–28% of workers are involved in a shift work schedule which includes some time spent working at night. shift workers predominate in heavy industries and emergency services, but they are also increasingly found in finance, ‘e-commerce,’ and service industries. shift work-related sleep disorder is characterized by excessive sleepiness at work and insomnia during scheduled times for sleep. data from epidemiological studies also suggest that shift workers, and especially those engaged in night work, are generally more prone to gastro-intestinal problems, obesity, heart disease, and cancer than day workers. disruption of circadian rhythms during shift work is thought to be important in explaining these increased health problems. nevertheless, differences between shift workers and day workers in lifestyle factors, including participation in physical activity, have been generally under-researched. evaluated treatments for shift work-related sleep problems include light exposure, melatonin ingestion, hypnotics, caffeine, and central nervous stimulants or other agents influencing sleepiness. most studies show positive results, although most have involved a simulation of shift work in the laboratory rather than actual shift work which is associated with a multitude of biological and socio-behavioral stressors. modafinil and armodafinil are two of the few substances which have been studied in randomized controlled trials involving patients with diagnosed shift work sleep disorder. both substances were found to improve sleepiness during the work period and sleep quality in rest periods. it seems as though there are no randomized controlled trials which have tested the efficacy of lifestyle-based interventions on such outcomes in patients with diagnosed shift work type sleep disorder. © 2013 elsevier inc. all rights reserved."
"we present a critique of behavioral economics, the dominant approach to reforming the regulation of retail credit, and propose a new approach to managing uncertainty in consumer lending. this new approach draws on a different model of decision-making, distributed cognition, to improve contract origination, and it takes inspiration from the legal theory of finance with respect to contract enforcement. we develop a set of stylized arguments about information-related problems and their possible solutions in central and east european markets, discussing separately measures to protect lenders, such as requiring collateral, collection, screening and data sharing, and those to protect consumers, including disclosure, data privacy and regulation of automated individual decisions. then we move to enforcement and using the empirical case of the hungarian foreign exchange mortgage crisis we illustrate the importance of elasticity of law. © 2013 association for comparative economic studies."

"the events of the last decade have challenged the contemporary neo-classical synthesis in all branches of economics, but particularly public finance. the most notable feature of the 2nd edition of public finance in theory and practice is the infusion of behavioral economics throughout the text, with an end of chapter question inviting the student to apply a behavioral lens to some question or issue. there continues to be an emphasis on the importance of the institutional context, drawing on examples from many countries and emphasizing the role of lower level governments in a federal system. the first five chapters establish this context by reviewing the role of government in a market system, the description of government structure from an economic perspective, the basic data about revenue and expenditures, the elements of public choice, and the distributional role of government. the book has been substantially reorganized to put more emphasis on public expenditure. expanded treatment of public goods includes common property resources and congestible or club goods. expanded discussion of budgeting and cost-benefit analysis provides some practical application of the theory. updated discussions of social security, public education and health care address these three major contemporary public finance issues. the traditional emphasis on revenue (taxes, fees and grants) has been retained but follows rather than precedes the discussion of expenditures. © 2003, 2011 holley h. ulbrich. all rights reserved."
"this paper deals with a bayesian extension of a behavioral finance framework ‘à la’ de grauwe and grimaldi (the exchange rate in a behavioural finance framework, princeton university press, princeton, 2006) in which agents operating in the fx market differ in their forecasting time horizon for the exchange rate. in the short run, if we believe in the world described by meese and rogoff (j. int. econ., 14(1–2):3–24, 1983), this leads to a chartist rule, whereas in the long run, the ppp condition appears as a natural anchor. in between, i.e. in the medium run, we implement an apeer model using bayesian tools, as an alternative to the feer-beer nexus. our results show that the stabilizing impact of the intermediate rule depends on agents’ good perception of the fundamentals. © springer international publishing switzerland 2013."
"in this paper, the main features of over-the-counter derivatives are examined together with the rules applicable in case of so-called negotiation ""per conto altrui"" (that means as a simple seller of financial instrument on behalf of the issuer or owner). in this regard, the questions and following litigation on trading in derivatives concerned essentially the operations in direct counterpart not traded on regulated markets that have been characterized by evident problems of illiquidity and opacity. as a consequence, the reference to the behavioral norms that the legal system requires to intermediary in the execution of investment services and that have been subject to revision as a result of the transposition of mifid directive. in the attempt to identify remedies that protect the investor from errors in risk assessment assumed on trading these financial instruments (remedies able to prevent a misuse of derivatives and able to come beyond the information transparency) it draws to the attention the behavioral finance and the probabilistic risk assessment."
"we study the relationship between the risk preferences of individuals and the risk preferences of the aggregate economy. to emphasize the vast differences that can occur between individual and market preferences brought about through aggregation, we assume an economy consisting entirely of risk seekers. we show that such individuals can lead to an aggregate economy that is risk averse. the converse is also true. an aggregate economy that exhibits risk aversion does not imply an economy of individual risk averters. an economy demanding a risk premium can be formed from individuals who do not demand such compensation. understanding the relationship between the preferences of individuals and the preferences of the aggregate economy is crucial for understanding the connection between the behavioral finance literature, which focuses on individual preferences, and the asset-pricing literature, which focuses on aggregate prices. we discuss empirical implications of these results. © 2013 informs."

"notwithstanding their many environmental, economic and social advantages, renewable energy technologies (re) account for a small fraction of the world's primary energy supply. one possible cause for this limited diffusion is that private investments in the re sector, although potentially appealing, remain insufficient. the lack of adequate financing is also a clear indication that our understanding of the process by which investors fund re ventures is still incomplete. this paper aims to fill in this gap and to shed new light on re investment decisions. building upon behavioral finance and institutional theory, we posit that, in addition to a rational evaluation of the economics of the investment opportunities, various non-financial factors affect the decision to invest in renewables. we analyze the investment decisions of a large sample of investors, with the objective to identify the main determinants of their choices. our results shed new light on the role of institutional and behavioral factors in determining the share of renewable energy technologies in energy portfolios, and have important implications for both investors and policy makers: they suggest that re technologies still suffer from a series of biased perceptions and preconceptions that favor status quo energy production models over innovative alternatives. © 2012 elsevier inc."
"recent empirical evidence based on surveys and experimental activities within the fields of behavioral finance and financial education has offered economists new empirically based insights into how individuals use information in making financial decisions. specifically, the importance of information in financial decisions may be reduced or eliminated by psychological aspects of the individual, such as a state of overconfidence that is individual or shared with a group, or by the individual's limited ability to process complex and abundant information. this paper aims to complement this emerging body of literature by studying how individuals perceive and process information when making financial decisions. we review these contributions and suggest a number of broad guidelines that can provide a framework for future discussion of this topic within financial decision theory. © 2011 blackwell publishing ltd."
"both traditional finance and behavioral finance theory have reached a consensus that the news media de facto influence stock prices to some extent. there is also evidence that investors are not only subject to the sentiment of related news articles but also the public opinions. the challenge lies on how to quantify such sentimental information to predict the movement of stock market. to measure the sentiments of articles and capture the public mood from postings, we construct and maintain a sentiment dictionary. we utilize both the official information from news articles and user postings in discussion boards to predict firm-specific stock price, and differentiate various types of news articles in the predictive model. our experiments on csi 100 stocks during a six week period show a predictive performance in closeness to the actual future stock price is 0.03503 in terms of mean squared error, the same direction of price movement as the future price is 67.6%. among all seven news topic categories, restructuring news of enterprises has the best predicting performance with direction accuracy of 68.18%."
"in this chapter, we describe how risk and ambiguity impact the value of choice options, how this impact can be modelled formally and how it is implemented in the brain. in particular, we give an overview of two distinct ways of how risky choice options can be decomposed - either into outcomes and probabilities as proposed in economics or into statistical moments of the probability distribution like mean, variance, or skewness, as proposed in finance theory. the components of either approach appear to be represented in common and, at least to some extent, in separate brain regions, which include the dopaminergic midbrain, striatum and the orbitofrontal cortex. activity in different (prefrontal and striatal) brain regions also supports the distinction between decisions from experience, when knowledge about risk is learned through trial and error versus decisions from description, when it is described symbolically. the fact that the principal components of formal models from economics and finance theory and their behavioral versions that provide better descriptive fit are represented in the brain provides converging support for these models. © 2014 elsevier inc. all rights reserved."

"using a data set that combines trading records in a financial investment simulation with survey responses, this study provides evidence that a domain-specific variant of risk-taking propensity, namely risk taking in gambling (but not in investing) situations, predicts the volume of trades of financial investors. we find that investors' gambling risk-taking propensity, measured by the weber, blais, and betz [2002], domain-specific-risk-taking (dospert) gambling subscale, increases the number of trades made and hence transaction costs, as well as the extent of their day trading. the short (four-item) gambling risk-taking propensity dospert subscale thus provides a useful diagnostic addition to risk attitude assessment instruments for private investors. © the institute of behavioral finance."
"lottery stocks are a puzzle: individual investors value these stocks highly despite their low average returns and high volatility (kumar [2009]). i argue that individuals are attracted to lottery stocks because they are risk-seeking and sentiment-prone. because risk preferences are not directly observable, i use a model-free approach based on stochastic dominance to infer aggregate risk preferences. i also use a direct measure of individual investor sentiment, the bull-bear spread, to test whether sentiment affects the returns of lottery stocks. my results show that lottery stock investors are indeed risk seekers. sentiment also plays an important role in explaining the demand and returns of lottery versus nonlottery stocks. the lottery stock puzzle can thus be understood only by incorporating unusual risk preferences and the propensity for individual investors to trade on sentiment. © the institute of behavioral finance."
"neuroeconomics shares the main goals of microeconomics: to understand what causes choices, and the welfare properties of choice. the novel goal is linking mathematical constructs and observable behavior to mechanistic details of neural circuitry. several complementary methods are used. an initial insight from neuroscience is that distinct systems guide choice: pavlovian and instrumental conditioning (learning) of state-value and response-value associations, overlearned habits, and model-(or goal-) directed value that requires deliberation. these systems can differ economically from rational choice-for example, habitual choices have low utility and price elasticities, whereas model-directed values are often constructed preferences. neuroeconomics also provides evidence of situations in which utility maximization either works well (in simple binary choice) or benefits from the introduction of behavioral constructs. neuroeconomics is well equipped to guide the theory of how choices depend on mental states, such as fear or cognitive load. examples include extensive studies of risk and time preference, finance, and neural decoding of private information. © 2013 by annual reviews. all rights reserved."
"prospect theory is increasingly used to explain deviations from the traditional paradigm of rational agents. empirical support for prospect theory comes mainly from laboratory experiments using student samples. it is obviously important to know whether and to what extent this support generalizes to more naturally occurring circumstances. this article explores this question and measures prospect theory for a sample of private bankers and fund managers. we obtained clear support for prospect theory. our financial professionals behaved according to prospect theory and violated expected utility maximization. they were risk averse for gains and risk seeking for losses and their utility was concave for gains and (slightly) convex for losses. they were also averse to losses, but less so than commonly observed in laboratory studies and assumed in behavioral finance. a substantial minority focused on gains and largely ignored losses, behavior reminiscent of what caused the current financial crisis. © 2011 the author(s)."

"this chapter seeks to reconcile fundamental financial approaches with uncertainty. uncertainty is defined by the unknown rather than the predictable, counted and accounted for. while financial decisions are reached based on what we know, what we can predict and what we can presume based on experience and the rationalities that financial agents assume. the uncertainty we consider is defined in a limited sense, namely, a partial knowledge of future state preferences and their quantification. there are many approaches to do so such as negligence of the unknown, human intentional rationalities as well behavioral and psychological approaches to confront the unknown. this chapter focuses its attention on the use of entropy for “non-extensive systems” (a term commonly used in physics with its parallel in finance, which we define as “incompleteness”) based on a parametric generalization of the boltzmann–gibbs entropy (which assumes extensive systems). optimization of the tsallis parametric entropy for non-extensive systems is then used to derive implied power laws and standardized probability distributions that are both asymmetric and have fat tails. this approach provides a parametric definition of the “missing”, namely the tail probabilities not accounted for in selecting an asset future price distribution. subsequently, the chapter outlines a number of approaches to robust decision models and ex-post risk management. it concludes with a discussion of risk externalities in financial and environmental regulation and draws a parallel between “banks’ risks” for which they do not assume responsibility for and pollution risks of firms and consumers who consume and who do not assume their pollution consequences. both cases, call for an efficient regulation and statistical controls which is the topic of chap. 11. © charles s. tapiero 2013."
"using a large sample of recommendations from 1997 to 2007, this article shows that analysts often downgrade a seasoned stock prior to initiating research coverage on an initial public offering (ipo). downgrades are more likely to occur if the analyst's investment bank has no underwriting relationship with the seasoned firm. from 1997 to 2001, i find some evidence supporting the hypothesis of strength of analyst coverage: downgrades by analysts affiliated with the ipo lead manager were negatively associated with the ipo's price performance after the offering day. analysts were likely to downgrade a seasoned stock prior to promoting a cold ipo, underwritten by their investment bank. since 2002, when new rules on analyst independence were adopted, downgrades of seasoned stocks have become unrelated to the price performance of ipos. © the institute of behavioral finance."
"we show that the repurchaser-issuer return spread is stronger among stocks with high return volatility. rational and behavioral theories predict that this finding is the product of risk volatility and sentiment volatility, respectively. however, our results are inconsistent with these theories as they currently stand. loadings on standard risk factors do not follow the dynamics that would explain the return predictability related to issuance decisions. if we sort on a stock's beta with respect to the aggregate sentiment index of baker and wurgler (2006, j. finance, 61, 1645-1680), which proxies for sentiment volatility, the results are weaker - economically and statistically - than when sorting on return volatility. © 2012 the authors 2012."
"purpose-this paper examines the effect of rational and irrational investor sentiment on the stock return and volatility of us auto, finance, food, oil and utility industries. design/methodology/approach-the american association of individual investors index (aaii) is used as a proxy for us individual investor sentiment. the us market fundamentals are regressed on investor sentiment in order to capture the effect of macroeconomic risk factors on investor sentiment. then impulse response functions (irfs) are generated from a var model to investigate the effect of unanticipated movements in us investor sentiment on both industry-specific stock return and volatility. findings-the results show a significant impact of investor sentiment on stock return and volatility in all the industries. we find that the positive rational component of us individual investor sentiment tends to increase the stock return in these industries.we also document that unanticipated increase in the rational component of us individual investor sentiment has a significant negative impact only on the industry volatilities of us auto and finance industries. research limitations/implications-the results are based only on the 1999-2010 us industryspecific stock return and volatility data and are confined to these industries. practical implications-the findings of this paper can help investors to improve their asset return generating models by incorporating investor sentiment. the findings can also help policymakers to design policies that stabilize sentiment and reduce volatility and uncertainty in the stock markets. originality/value-this paper adds to the growing literature on behavioral finance by filling a gap and addressing the impact of investor sentiment in the various us industries. © emerald group publishing limited."
"some recent studies suggest that high levels of household debt and leverage have contributed to the relatively sluggish growth of consumer spending in the past few years (dynan, 2012; mian, rao, and sufi, 2013). however, this conclusion has not been widely accepted because of the empirical challenges associated with identifying the relationship amid the dramatic and complicated changes in the household economic environment during the great recession and subsequent slow recovery. leverage may indirectly influence spending by increasing borrowing constraints, impeding refinancing, and raising the likelihood that a household will face future borrowing constraints. leverage may directly influence spending simply by making some households uncomfortable with their leverage compared with some behavioral benchmark. the authors use the 2007-09 survey of consumer finances panel to explore these issues. they find that highly leveraged households were more likely to report cutting back their spending in 2009, even after controlling for other factors expected to influence spending, such as changes in income and wealth. in analyzing that relationship, the authors find evidence that leverage influenced household spending through several channels. © 2013, the federal reserve bank of st. louis."
"the events of the last decade have challenged the contemporary neo-classical synthesis in all branches of economics, but particularly public finance. the most notable feature of the 2nd edition of public finance in theory and practice is the infusion of behavioral economics throughout the text, with an end of chapter question inviting the student to apply a behavioral lens to some question or issue. there continues to be an emphasis on the importance of the institutional context, drawing on examples from many countries and emphasizing the role of lower level governments in a federal system. the first five chapters establish this context by reviewing the role of government in a market system, the description of government structure from an economic perspective, the basic data about revenue and expenditures, the elements of public choice, and the distributional role of government.; the book has been substantially reorganized to put more emphasis on public expenditure. expanded treatment of public goods includes common property resources and congestible or club goods. expanded discussion of budgeting and cost-benefit analysis provides some practical application of the theory. updated discussions of social security, public education and health care address these three major contemporary public finance issues. the traditional emphasis on revenue (taxes, fees and grants) has been retained but follows rather than precedes the discussion of expenditures. © 2003, 2011 holley h. ulbrich."
"using a rich dataset of stock spam e-mails as a laboratory, we test and find support for three behavioral finance theories related to investor attention, ambiguity, and overweighting of low probability outcomes. first, we find that both the dollar volume and return on the peak day of the spam campaigns (scs) are significantly higher compared to those on randomly selected non-spam dates. in addition, scs reduce the number of zero trading days while the campaign is underway. second, e-mails with a target price have significantly higher abnormal dollar volume and abnormal return on the peak day of the sc than e-mails without a target price. thus, individual investors favor bets with unambiguous payoffs, which supports the ambiguity hypothesis. finally, when the target price indicated in spam e-mails is about 53 times the current price, the abnormal return of the sc peaked at 31%. we document a nonlinear relationship between abnormal return on the peak day of the scs and the premium implied in the spam e-mails. although investors overweight low probability events, the overweighting decreases when the probability becomes out of reach. our findings concerning target price are consistent with cumulative prospect theory. © 2013 copyright taylor and francis group, llc."
"purpose: the current study examined the independent association between positive (e.g., emotional and instrumental support) and negative (e.g., insensitive behavior, unwanted advice from others) social exchanges and suicidal ideation among veterans referred for a behavioral health assessment. methods: the sample included 606 veterans [mean age = 54.96 (sd = 14.96)] referred by primary care for a clinical mental health/substance abuse (mh/sa) assessment following a positive mh/sa screen. data on sociodemographics, mh/sa conditions (e.g., depression, ptsd, anxiety, and alcohol abuse), the self-reported frequency of positive and negative social exchanges, and suicidal ideation were extracted from clinical interviews and evaluated. results: veterans were primarily male, non-married, and had adequate financial resources, and approximately half were white. 74.4 and 20.3 % met criteria for a mh/sa condition and suicidal ideation, respectively. multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that, adjusting for sociodemographics, physical functioning, and comorbid mh/sa conditions, veterans reporting more frequent negative exchanges with network members were significantly more likely to report suicidal ideation. positive exchanges, in contrast, were not significantly related to the outcome. inadequate finances and mh/sa conditions also were significantly related to suicidal ideation. conclusions: findings highlight the value of exploring the quality of social exchanges among veterans in primary care who screen positive for behavioral health issues, as such information has the potential to inform screening and intervention efforts aimed at reducing suicidal ideation. © 2012 springer-verlag."
"population data indicate that 14-28% of workers are involved in a shift work schedule which includes some time spent working at night. shift workers predominate in heavy industries and emergency services, but they are also increasingly found in finance, 'e-commerce,' and service industries. shift work-related sleep disorder is characterized by excessive sleepiness at work and insomnia during scheduled times for sleep. data from epidemiological studies also suggest that shift workers, and especially those engaged in night work, are generally more prone to gastro-intestinal problems, obesity, heart disease, and cancer than day workers. disruption of circadian rhythms during shift work is thought to be important in explaining these increased health problems. nevertheless, differences between shift workers and day workers in lifestyle factors, including participation in physical activity, have been generally under-researched. evaluated treatments for shift work-related sleep problems include light exposure, melatonin ingestion, hypnotics, caffeine, and central nervous stimulants or other agents influencing sleepiness. most studies show positive results, although most have involved a simulation of shift work in the laboratory rather than actual shift work which is associated with a multitude of biological and socio-behavioral stressors. modafinil and armodafinil are two of the few substances which have been studied in randomized controlled trials involving patients with diagnosed shift work sleep disorder. both substances were found to improve sleepiness during the work period and sleep quality in rest periods. it seems as though there are no randomized controlled trials which have tested the efficacy of lifestyle-based interventions on such outcomes in patients with diagnosed shift work type sleep disorder. © 2013 elsevier inc. all rights reserved."

"this paper examines how high-frequency trading decisions of individual investors are influenced by past price changes. specifically, we address the question as to whether decisions to open or close a position are different when investors already hold a position compared with when they do not. based on a unique data set from an electronic foreign exchange trading platform, oanda fxtrade, we find that investors' future order flow is (significantly) driven by past price movements and that these predictive patterns last up to several hours. this observation clearly shows that for high-frequency trading, investors rely on previous price movements in making future investment decisions. we provide clear evidence that market and limit orders flows are much more predictable if those orders are submitted to close an existing position than if they are used to open one. we interpret this finding as evidence for the existence of a monitoring effect, which has implications for theoretical market microstructure models and behavioral finance phenomena, such as the endowment effect. © 2012 copyright taylor and francis group, llc."

"this article addresses three topics. first, it describes what economists mean when they use the term ""bubble,"" and contrasts the behavioral finance view of asset pricing with the efficient market paradigm in an attempt to understand why bubbles might persist and why they may not be arbitraged away. second, it reviews some major historical examples of asset-price bubbles as well as the (minority) view that they may not have been bubbles at all. it also examines the corresponding changes in real economic activity that have followed the bursting of such bubbles. finally, it examines the most hotly debated aspect of any discussion of asset-price bubbles: what, if anything, should policy makers do about them? should they react to sharp increases in asset prices that they deem to be unrelated to ""fundamentals?"" should they take the view that they know more than the market does? should they recognize that asset-price bubbles are a periodic flaw of capitalism and conduct their policies so as to temper any developing excesses? or should they focus solely on their primary targets of inflation and real economic activity? the discussion pays particular attention to bubbles that are associated with sharp increases in credit and leverage. © 2012 by oxford university press, inc. all rights reserved."
"we postulate that both managerial overoptimism and earnings management using accruals to boost accounting numbers effect on initial public offering (ipo) valuation. referring to purnandam and swaminathan [2004], we gauge the ipo intrinsic values with respect to the offer price and the initial price. the portion that real offer (initial) price is above the intrinsic offer (initial) price is defined as offer premium (overreaction). using 287 taiwan's ipos in sampling period 2004-2008, we find that most ipo firms were overpriced rather than underpriced. the offer premium is neither affected by earnings management nor managerial optimism, which is probably due to the greater scrutiny by the associated underwriters who are less gullible to managerial optimism or earnings management. in contrast, in initial market price valuation investors are cautious to take the face value of earnings management when ipo managers are perceived of moderate optimism. however, investors directly discipline overoptimistic managers with a lower initial valuation. managerial overoptimism is the dominant factor in explaining long-run underperformance. we find that offer premium is positively associated with overreaction. moreover, earnings management, albeit unrelated to overoptimism and offer premium, is positively related with initial overreaction and long-run underperformance. © the institute of behavioral finance."

"this paper considers the portfolio management problem for an investor with finite time horizon who is allowed to consume and take out life insurance. natural assumptions, such as different discount rates for consumption and life insurance, lead to time inconsistency. this situation can also arise when the investor is in fact a group, the members of which have different utilities and/or different discount rates. as a consequence, the optimal strategies are not implementable. we focus on hyperbolic discounting, which has received much attention lately, especially in the area of behavioral finance. following [i. ekeland and t. a. pirvu, math. financ. econ., 2 (2008), pp. 57- 86], we consider the resulting problem as a leader-follower game between successive selves, each of whom can commit for an infinitesimally small amount of time. we then define policies as subgame perfect equilibrium strategies. policies are characterized by an integral equation which is shown to have a solution in the case of constant relative risk aversion utilities. our results can be extended for more general preferences as long as the equations admit solutions. numerical simulations reveal that for the merton problem with hyperbolic discounting, the consumption increases up to a certain time, after which it decreases; this pattern does not occur in the case of exponential discounting and is therefore known in the literature as the ""consumption puzzle."" other numerical experiments explore the effect of time varying aggregation rate on the insurance premium. copyright © 2012 by siam."
"risk-return tradeoff comprises the critical rationale for every investment decision, where every investor wishes to assume maximum return at minimum risk. however, investors differ in their decisions to assume investment risk because of their personal constraints. this study examined the factors responsible for creating gaps in investors' risk perception by focusing on three issues: (a) disclosure practices, (b) investors' perception about the mutual funds' services, and (c) risk anatomy. avoiding the extreme investment avenues, the study has included mutual fund investors only because investment in mutual funds is put forth in a way that assumes calculated risk and assures maximum return. the results highlighted by the study revealed that investors' demographic base, along with weak disclosure practices of mutual funds and the presence of volatility, shapes the anatomy of investors' risk decisions. the major implications of the study highlight that investors' demographic base has a significant impact on their risk perception, and financial services intermediaries should respond differently to the varied needs of individual investors based on their age, knowledge, income, and social responsibilities. © the institute of behavioral finance."
"we study the influence of systematic probability misestimation on complex financial investment decisions on the context of structured financial products. structured products have become more and more complex. we study the question whether this complexity might be a sophisticated method to exploit systematic biases in probability estimation of investors in order to make products look safer and more attractive than they actually are. we present results of an experiment that focused on probability estimates in the context of certain classes of structured products, in particular barrier reverse convertibles, bonus certificates, and worst-of basket certificates. we find that behavioral biases, for example, the conjunction fallacy, increase the subjective attractiveness of these product types. we also investigate potential ways to de-bias investors by providing additional information. © the institute of behavioral finance."
"when linked to human behavior and executed effectively, value-based pricing represents the most effective lever that a company has at its disposal to maximize profitability. the ability to integrate sophisticated analytics and market research in order to sell a customer the right product (and value) at the right price will drive profitability far more effectively and sustainably than other business initiatives (marn & rosiello, 1992, p. 84). this chapter addresses the use of analytics to determine where value resides and how to turn that analysis into an effective platform for pricing decisions. organization-wide involvement in pricing is essential. a company must provide those persons responsible for pricing - including finance and sales persons - with information regarding the levers they can pull in the product transaction execution. statistical business analytical software enables companies to apply microeconometrics (analytical and statistical capabilities) for the pricing and selling of products. the pricing waterfall helps companies understand where they can increase profits by using the pocket price and pocket margin to gain insights into which customer relationships can be more profitable than others. by examining the transaction structure, behavioral segmentation, and price optimization (three dimensions of the analytics triad), a company can conceive the full value proposition for groups of customers. an effective process and technology infrastructure that enables granular data development and analysis will help enable accurate and timely pricing decisions. © 2012 by emerald group publishing limited."
"recently, investor sentiment measures have become one of the more widely examined areas in behavioral finance. a number of measures have been developed in the literature without having been fully validated, and therefore leaving in question which measure should be used for empirical exploration. the purpose of this study is to examine the relative performance of a number of popular measures in predicting stock returns and to test the relative efficacy of a hybrid approach. using a panel of investor sentiment measures, we develop a new measure of sentiment which combines direct and indirect sentiment measures. our results show that our composite sentiment index affects the returns of stocks hard to value and difficult to arbitrage consistent with the predictions of noise trader's models. finally, we find that our composite index has a better predictive ability than the alternative sentiment measures largely used in the literature. © 2013 the clute institute."
"interest in corporate tax reform that lowers the rate and broadens the base has developed in the past several years. some discussions by economists in opinion pieces have suggested there is an urgent need to lower the corporate tax rate, but not necessarily to broaden the tax base, an approach that presents some difficulties given current budget pressures. others see the corporate tax as a potential source of revenue. arguments for lowering the corporate tax rate include the traditional concerns about economic distortions arising from the corporate tax and newer concerns arising from the increasingly global nature of the economy. some claims have been made that lowering the corporate tax rate would raise revenue because of the behavioral responses, an effect that is linked to an open economy. although the corporate tax has generally been viewed as contributing to a more progressive tax system because the burden falls on capital income and thus on higher income individuals, claims have also been made that the burden falls not on owners of capital, but on labor income-an effect also linked to an open economy. the analysis in this report suggests that many of the concerns expressed about the corporate tax are not supported by empirical data. claims that behavioral responses could cause revenues to rise if rates were cut do not hold up on either a theoretical basis or an empirical basis. studies that purport to show a revenue maximizing corporate tax rate of 30% (a rate lower than the current statutory tax rate) contain econometric errors that lead to biased and inconsistent results; when those problems are corrected the results disappear. cross-country studies to provide direct evidence showing that the burden of the corporate tax actually falls on labor yield unreasonable results and prove to suffer from econometric flaws that also lead to a disappearance of the results when corrected, in those cases where data were obtained and the results replicated. similarly, claims that high us tax rates will create problems for the united states in a global economy suffer from a misrepresentation of the us tax rate compared to other countries and are less important when capital is imperfectly mobile, as it appears to be. although these new arguments appear to rely on questionable methods, the traditional concerns about the corporate tax appear valid. while an argument may be made that the tax is still needed as a backstop to individual tax collections, it does result in some economic distortions. these economic distortions, however, have declined substantially over time as corporate rates and shares of output have fallen. moreover, it is difficult to lower the corporate tax without creating a way of sheltering individual income given the low rates of tax on dividends and capital gains. a number of revenue-neutral changes are available that could reduce these distortions, allow for a lower corporate statutory tax rate, and lead to a more efficient corporate tax system. these changes include base broadening, reducing the benefits of debt finance through inflation indexing, and reducing the tax at the firm level offset by an increase at the individual level. nevertheless, the scope for reducing the tax in a revenue neutral way may be limited. all rights reserved."

"the predictability of financial crises is widely regarded as low. however, skills linked to market psychology (behavioral finance) and the understanding of history and macrofinancial aggregates have been insufficiently integrated in the forecasting and risk management of financial institutions. traditional financial modeling can no longer be applied as nicely as in the past. in sweden, the financial crises of the early 1990s and in the latter part of the past decade were caused by overconfidence, control illusion, and herd mentality - but also by shortcomings in management and corporate governance. there is no evidence that these two serious swedish banking crises were not foreseeable. the general question is when and under which circumstances financial decision-makers and authorities should listen to the usual minority of warning voices. one conclusion is that economists should be more in house-oriented, and top managers should heed their professional opinions. conclusions from this paper can also be drawn for china, india, and other emerging markets both when it comes to financial deregulation policy and government debt risks in deregulated financial markets. © national association for business economics."

"this study goes beyond attitudes and behavioral indications as response to risk perceptions and focuses on actual behavior of laypeople. we report the results from a survey, conducted among a sample of swedish citizens in the spring of 2009, looking at lay actions as responses to the financial crisis of 2008. in total, 3138 respondents were asked whether they had done something to protect their money during the recent financial crisis or not. the total sample, 1053 respondents, was divided into two comparable groups and a binary logistic regression tested a model with nine factors hypothesized to be predicting the choice to act or not as a response to the financial crisis. among the eight factors predicting likelihood to act were gender, age, education, ethnicity, possession of assets affected of the financial crisis, worrying about the everyday household finances, the perception of others' actions, and importance put on being knowledgeable and up-dated about financial matters. the ninth factor-respondents' perception of the crisis to be a greater threat to the u.s. and global economy than to their own personal finances-did not contribute significantly to the model.a second aim of the study was to determine whether any individuals acted rashly and, if so, whether this group differed in any statistically significant way from the group of individuals that acted in a more financially circumspectly manner. in the group of individuals that acted rashly there is a higher propensity of: individuals who do not think they have assets affected by the crisis: individuals who have a lower level of education; and individuals who consider it important to be knowledgeable and up-to-date about financial matters. it should be of interest to policymakers and researchers to further explore features of this group of laypeople because it is the most important target group for consumer information and protection. © 2012 elsevier inc."
"the disposition effect is the tendency of investors to sell winners too early and hold losers too long. we use a simulation model to estimate the loss attributable to the disposition effect using historical data from five different stock markets around the world in four time periods. we find that loss increases with the relative unwillingness to sell losers, and is not reduced by trading more often. we also find that delaying the sale of winning stocks, and applying a selling discipline that sells off stocks once they cross preset thresholds, can reduce the loss attributable to the disposition effect. © the institute of behavioral finance."

"various explanations for the popularity of covered call option strategies have been explored in the literature. according to shefrin and statman [1993], framing and risk aversion can help justify its attractiveness to investors. applying prospect theory and hedonic framing, these authors predict that in a world of frame dependence an investor that is sufficiently risk averse in the domain of gains will prefer a covered call position over a stock only position and that certain covered call designs will be preferred despite identical cash flows. to date, the relationship among framing, risk aversion, and covered call writing has not been empirically tested. we gather empirical evidence to complete this gap in the literature. we find highly significant empirical evidence for a pronounced framing effect with respect to different covered call designs with equal net cash flows as well as covered calls in general. we find only scarce empirical evidence for a relationship between risk aversion in the domain of gains and a preference for covered calls. in order to observe a positive relationship between risk aversion and covered call writing, investors with above average risk aversion seem to be required. © the institute of behavioral finance."
"the cycle of boom and crash is a ""natural"" element in financial market history, and numerous research works have provided evidence that market prices spend far more time deviating from postulated theoretical equilibrium than actually tending towards it. in particular, nonmeanreverting dynamism in financial markets may be produced by mass psychological dynamics in the patterns of human aggregate behavior, which result from nonrational herding impulses sensed by market participants in complex and uncertain situations. based on a literature review and the analysis of several case studies, this paper elucidates postulated mechanisms behind, and characteristics of, herding in financial markets. the main goal is to raise awareness of the often little-understood point that collective behavior does not simply sum up preexisting individual motives and preferences. thus, the paper focuses on the mechanism of how individually unintended aggregate outcomes such as financial market booms and panics are shaped by collective dynamics and social interactions between traders and their social environment. © the institute of behavioral finance."

"in the spirit of behavioral finance, we study the process of opinion formation among investors using a variant of the two-dimensional voter model with a tunable social temperature. further, a feedback acting on the temperature is introduced, such that social temperature reacts to market imbalances and thus becomes time dependent. in this toy market model, social temperature represents nervousness of agents toward market imbalances representing speculative risk. we use the knowledge about the discontinuous generalized voter model phase transition to determine critical fixed points. the system exhibits metastable phases around these fixed points characterized by structured lattice states, with intermittent excursions away from the fixed points. the statistical mechanics of the model is characterized, and its relation to dynamics of opinion formation among investors in real markets is discussed. © 2012 american physical society."
"with the development of research on behavioral corporate finance, the irrational behaviors of decision makers have received more attention from scholars around the world. managerial overconfidence is recognized as an important factor accounting for financial decisions. this paper classifies mangers into three levels, including chairman, ceo and tmt. through exploring the effect of managerial overconfidence on corporate investment decision for different levels of managers, we find out that the overconfidence of chairman and ceo has a significant effect on investment level and merger decisions, while the overconfidence of tmt only affects investment level and investment cash flow sensitivity. this paper approves the effect of managerial overconfidence vary in different manager levels, thus provides an empirical evidence to regulate managers' irrational behaviors. © 2012 ieee."
"consumers make many decisions in everyday life involving finances, food, and health. it is known from behavioral economics research that people are often driven by short-term gratification, that is, people tend to choose the immediate, albeit smaller reward. but choosing the delayed reward, that is, delaying the gratification, can actually be beneficial. how can we motivate consumers to resist the "" now"" and invest in their future, leading to sustainable or healthy habits? we review recent developments from behavioral and neuroimaging studies that are relevant for understanding consumer decisions. further, we present results from our field research that examined whether we can increase the perceived value of a (delayed) environmental benefit using tailored communication, that is, change the way it is framed. more specifically, we investigated whether we can boost the value of an abstract, long-term "" green"" claim of a product by expressing it as a concrete, short-term benefit. this is a new application area for behavioral economics. © 2013 elsevier b.v."
"this study is the first to empirically test both forward and (falsely induced) reverse information cascades in an experimental setting using real-time instant feedback to participants. we find that, on average, individuals abandon their private information sets in favor of the group's as early as three steps and as late as five steps into the information discovery process. these findings are important to the fields of both finance and real estate in that we document a personality trait that causes individuals to be swayed from their independently chosen course of action. the results have ramifications for herding behavior and when modeling the spread of society's willingness to strategically default. © the institute of behavioral finance."
"stock selection has long been recognized as an important task in finance. researchers and practitioners in this area often use regression models to tackle this problem due to their simplicity and effectiveness. recent advances in machine learning (ml) are leading to significant opportunities to solve these problems more effectively. in this paper, we present a comparative study between the traditional regression-based and evolution-based models using investor sentiment indicators for stock selection. in the evolution-based models, genetic algorithms (ga) are used for optimization of model parameters and feature selection of input variables simultaneously. we will show that our proposed ga-based method significantly outperforms the traditional regression-based method as well as the benchmark. we thus expect this evolution-based methodology to advance the research in machine learning for behavioral finance. © 2012 ieee."
"studies on behavioral corporate finance have documented that overconfident managers invest more than their more rational peers. reasons include that overconfidence reduces managers' ability to perceive risk correctly. however, although it has been addressed in several theoretical models, the impact of overconfidence on firm success has received little empirical examination. based on a unique 10-year panel dataset of german chief executive officers (ceos) and their companies, we investigate the relationship between overconfidence and firm success. in line with principal agent theory and the hubris hypothesis, we find negative effects of ceo overconfidence during economic recessions. however, we also find a strong positive impact of ceo overconfidence on firm profitability and stock market performance during the early phases of the business cycle. these novel insights imply that overconfidence operates using different mechanisms in routine than in one-time situations. in particular it hints at heightened individual effort and work performance of overconfident individuals as described in psychological studies. our findings suggest a reciprocal relationship between macroeconomic developments and microeconomic decision-making, a finding that may help to illuminate aggregated patterns such as herding and investment bubbles and the current economic and financial crisis. © the institute of behavioral finance."
"this paper has an empirical financial purpose. evidence is presented that negative returns have a differential impact on the correlation between stock returns. the samples encompass daily observations for 18 us stock indexes, 40 regional stock indexes, and a secular daily sample for the s&p 500 and the djia since the 1950s. the evidence is statistically very strong. it is estimated that negative returns increase the variance of stock returns by at least 2.7% and by utmost 18.3%. standard financial theory cannot explain such a behavior. however, loss aversion and the disposition effect from behavioral finance can explain it. the disposition effect predicts that investors hold on to losing stocks more than to winning stocks. this creates a low volume of trading when there are negative returns, which results in less liquidity, and hence more volatility. © international economic society."
"we examine winner and loser portfolios as a result of the financial crisis from 2007 to 2008 to determine the ex-ante characteristics of winner and loser stocks. the best performing decile actually gained more than 27% in our sample of 2,267 firms while the worst performing decile lost nearly 90% of its value. we show that investor sentiment shifted away from risky stocks, but risk aversion went beyond an avoidance of market and intrinsic risk. smaller, value stocks with high-leverage significantly underperformed the market while investors shifted to larger, glamour stocks with high dividend yields. our results provide strong support for the theories of projection bias, risk aversion and regret avoidance. © the institute of behavioral finance."
"barberis, shleifer, and vishny [1998] and others have developed bayesian models to explain investors' behavioral biases by using conservative heuristics and representative heuristics in making decisions. to extend their work, lam, liu, and wong [2010] have developed a model of weight assignments using a pseudo-bayesian approach that reflects investors' behavioral biases. in this parsimonious model of investor sentiment, weights induced by investors' conservative and representative heuristics are assigned to observations of the earning shocks of stock prices. such weight assignments enable us to provide a quantitative link between some market anomalies and investors' behavioral biases. this paper extends their work further by developing a theory to explain some market anomalies, including short-term underreaction, long-term overreaction, and excess volatility. we also explain in detail the linkage between these market anomalies and investors' behavioral biases. © the institute of behavioral finance."

"automated trading now dominates the financial markets. yet no philosophy of academic research into the topic exists. as the growth in automated trading suggests their greater returns and predictability, this paper examines stability and statistical control of trading process outputs as method of justifying predictions of future performance. new assumptions presented can form a foundation for positive research under this revolutionary paradigm, one almost completely ignored in the financial literature. the traditional financial literature rests on the assumption of normality of inputs, while trading systems aspire to the more rigorous engineering standard of justification. the end game is that now behavioral aspects, not of traders but of trading system research and development projects, drive market returns. © the institute of behavioral finance."
"the analysis of different data sources to support financial decision making has been a subject of research for several decades. while early approaches mostly focus on structured data, recent studies also take into account unstructured data. in this paper, we build upon these two research streams and explore potential benefits that can be achieved by combining both approaches. therefore, we present an approach that integrates both data types. from a theoretical perspective, our research angle is based on two fundamental theories in finance: while the efficient market hypothesis states that capital markets are information efficient, behavioral finance theory stresses that market efficiency may be limited, e.g. due to irrational behavior of market participants or market barriers. while the two theories provide arguments for and against the functioning of our approach, we can illustrate its superiority compared to other approaches. the implications are discussed from a methodological and theoretical perspective. © 2013 springer-verlag."

"we provide evidence of disposition effect propensity for stock trading simulation participants employing a contrarian versus a momentum strategy. we found that even subjects playing with chips rather than real money remain vulnerable to those effects. both tendencies were generally evident in our sample, but we also found individual differences. subjects seemed to be contrarians both on position opening and on position closing. the main hypothesis of this paper states that contrarian investors are more prone to the disposition effect than are momentum traders. the model proposed by dacey and zielonka [2008] plays a crucial role in formulating this hypothesis. we consider the disposition effect not only in terms of the value function but also of the probability weighting function. in accordance with our hypothesis, we found that contrarian traders are more prone to the disposition effect. © the institute of behavioral finance."
"research into mergers and acquisitions (m&as) has been dominated by scholars of finance and strategy since its beginnings in the 1960s. in recent decades, research attention has expanded to include its human aspects, although the current literature is still comparatively small. research evidence to date has tended to highlight that acquired employees respond negatively to m&a events and the process of integration that subsequently follows. consequently, m&as have become associated with a range of dysfunctional emotional and behavioral outcomes, including lowered morale, job dissatisfaction, increased stress, unproductive behavior, acts of sabotage, increased labor turnover, and absenteeism. this chapter reviews the current research evidence on the impact of m&as on the individual and its implications for practice and future research. © oxford university press 2012. all rights reserved."
"this study examines a number of behavioral finance issues as they relate to real estate investments. we find a statistically significant degree of mental accounting at all points throughout the disposition effect curve when holding a real estate investment in isolation versus holding the asset as part of a mixed-asset portfolio. we also identify four distinct disposition curve shapes beyond the traditional ""s-shaped"" curve, where investors are more willing to sell an asset that is in the gains domain. furthermore, we conclude that an investor's willingness to sell jumps by the greatest amount when going from zero return into profitable territory. finally, this false reference point does take into consideration transaction costs. © the institute of behavioral finance."

"this study adopts the methodology introduced by lee (2006) to analyze stock prices in response to information shocks in six of taiwan's stock market sectors and present market anomalies utilizing behavioral finance theory. using the residual income model (rim) of equity valuation, we specified our empirical model to identify structural fundamental and nonfundamental shocks from reduced-form tangible and intangible news, and we obtained three major results. first, fundamental shock is primarily induced by tangible news and nonfundamental shock by intangible news, suggesting that tangible-oriented rim can capture the information content of stock prices. second, impulse response analyses show that investors generally underreact to fundamental shocks and consistently overreact to nonfundamental shocks in the short-run. this finding is compatible with the overconfidence theory of daniel et al. (1998) in behavioral finance literature. third, information diffusion efficiency in a market appears to depend on the value relevance quality of its tangible information. this is based on our finding that when tangible information constitutes a higher share of a market's fundamental shock, its price converges faster to the long-run equilibrium associated with the shock. © 2012 world scientific publishing co. and center for pacific basin business, economics and finance research."

"background: the initial treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd) has generally been limited to serotonergic agents, cognitive-behavioral therapy (cbt), or a combination of the two. these findings were supported by the pots study for ocd in children and adolescents. however, treatment with serotonergic agents or cbt can take several weeks before benefit is seen; severe cases of ocd may require more immediate treatment. case report: the authors present a case of severe ocd in an adolescent that required immediate treatment due to her critical medical condition. the patient's symptoms included not eating or taking medications or fluids by mouth due to fears of contamination. a medical hospitalization was previously required due to dehydration. as treatment with an ssri would not have quick enough onset and the patient was initially resistant to participating in cbt, the patient was psychiatrically hospitalized and first started on liquid risperidone. after several doses of risperidone, the patient was able to participate in cbt and start sertraline. discussion: the authors discuss the differential diagnosis of such a patient, including the continuum of ocd symptoms and psychotic symptoms. the authors discuss the different treatment options, including the utilization of inpatient psychiatric hospitalization. the authors discuss the potential risks and benefits of using atypical antipsychotics in lieu of benzodiazepines for the initial treatment of severe adolescent ocd. the authors also discuss other current treatment recommendations and rationale for the treatment that was pursued. conclusions: this patient received benefit of her symptoms relatively quickly with psychiatric hospitalization and an atypical antipsychotic. the diagnosis of a psychotic disorder should be considered. these treatment options must be weighed against the risks of atypical antipsychotics, including extrapyramidal symptoms, weight gain, and metabolic syndrome; benzodiazepines also have their risks and benefits. additionally, the cost of time and finances of inpatient hospitalization must be considered. more research is needed regarding the short- and long-term efficacy and safety of antipsychotics in the treatment of ocd in the child and adolescent population. © 2012 akadémiai kiadó."

"some economic events are so major and unsettling that they ""change everything."" such is the case with the financial crisis that started in the summer of 2007 and is still a drag on the world economy. yet enough time has now elapsed for economists to consider questions that run deeper than the usual focus on the immediate causes and consequences of the crisis. how have these stunning events changed our thinking about the role of the financial system in the economy, about the costs and benefits of financial innovation, about the efficiency of financial markets, and about the role the government should play in regulating finance? in rethinking the financial crisis, some of the nation's most renowned economists share their assessments of particular aspects of the crisis and reconsider the way we think about the financial system and its role in the economy. in its wide-ranging inquiry into the financial crash, rethinking the financial crisis marshals an impressive collection of rigorous and yet empirically-relevant research that, in some respects, upsets the conventional wisdom about the crisis and also opens up new areas for exploration. two separate chapters-by burton g. malkiel and by hersh shefrin and meir statman - debate whether the facts of the financial crisis upend the efficient market hypothesis and require a more behavioral account of financial market performance. to build a better bridge between the study of finance and the ""real"" economy of production and employment, simon gilchrist and egan zakrasjek take an innovative measure of financial stress and embed it in a model of the u.s. economy to assess how disruptions in financial markets affect economic activity-and how the federal reserve might do monetary policy better. the volume also examines the crucial role of financial innovation in the evolution of the pre-crash financial system. thomas philippon documents the huge increase in the size of the financial services industry relative to real gdp, and also the increasing cost per financial transaction. he suggests that the finance industry of 1900 was just as able to produce loans, bonds, and stocks as its modern counterpart-and it did so more cheaply. robert jarrow looks in detail at some of the major types of exotic securities developed by financial engineers, such as collateralized debt obligations and credit-default swaps, reaching judgments on which make the real economy more efficient and which do not. the volume's final section turns explicitly to regulatory matters. robert litan discusses the political economy of financial regulation before and after the crisis. he reviews the provisions of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010, which he considers an imperfect but useful response to a major breakdown in market and regulatory discipline. at a time when the financial sector continues to be a source of considerable controversy, rethinking the financial crisis addresses important questions about the complex workings of american finance and shows how the study of economics needs to change to deepen our understanding of the indispensable but risky role that the financial system plays in modern economies. © 2012 by russell sage foundation and the century foundation. all rights reserved."
"purpose – the purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of jewish holidays on us stock market returns. design/methodology/approach – the authors use event study and regression methodology to determine abnormal returns on jewish holidays and windowed periods surrounding the day. in order to seclude the results to jewish holidays, the authors control for several other known events that impact stock market returns. to substantiate claims of abnormal returns, the authors also use the fama-french four-factor model to seek alpha and evidence returns on jewish holidays. findings – this study shows, during the 1990-2009 period, an increase in average daily returns 32 times greater on nine jewish holidays than on the other trading days of the year. the demeanor of the specific jewish holidays also influences stock market returns, as the market returns increase (decrease) on the joyous (solemn) jewish holidays. also, individual investors, rather than institutional investors, are a greater catalyst for the increased returns. originality/value – previous research details increased stock market returns on us holidays and several other events. however, no definable research exists on stock market returns on jewish holidays. the findings in this paper are valuable to investors who event-trade, and are also valuable to investors and behavioral-finance researchers who seek to understand how demeanor and moods may impact buying/selling decisions. © 2012, © emerald group publishing limited."
"the influence of emotions on decision making is widely accepted, particularly in relation to incidental emotions and moods. the influence of specific emotions integral to a decision is, perhaps, less explored. explanations of many behavioral anomalies exist that exclude such emotions as important elements, but this may be an oversight - might it be that specific emotions are necessary causes for such behaviors rather than merely playing a supporting role? in this paper we investigate this issue experimentally, using as an example a robust behavioral anomaly in the finance area: the disposition effect, which is generally explained in terms of prospect theory. by manipulating the emotions evoked by an investment task in five studies we show that specific emotional responses are necessary causes of this effect. we provide evidence, therefore, that the specific emotions associated with tasks may play a more important role than previously recognized in some behavioral anomalies. © 2012 elsevier inc."

"we investigate how the strength of the positive association between frequency of trading and information acquisition is dependent on the sources of information used by investors and on investors' overconfidence. we add to the existing literature by investigating if the positive relationship between investment in information and intensity of trading in financial assets is sensitive to the sources of information used by investors, and if this influence is different for overconfident and non-overconfident investors.our results confirm the classical statement that the more frequently individual investors invest in information, the more they trade in financial products. they also confirm behavioral finance findings that overconfident investors, who show a better than average bias, trade more frequently. our findings are novel showing that the more overconfident and non-overconfident investors invest in information the more they trade, but the trading behavior is sensitive to the sources of information used. overconfident investors trade less frequently when they collect information via friends and family, and non-overconfident investors trade more frequently when they use specialized sources of information. © 2012 elsevier b.v."

"the consequences of taking on risk can be ruinous to personal finances, professional careers, corporate survivability, and even nation states. yet many risk managers do not have a clear understanding of the basics. requiring no statistical or mathematical background, the fundamental rules of risk management gives you the knowledge to successfully handle risk in your organization. the book begins with a deep investigation into the behavioral roots of risk. using both historical and contemporary contexts, author nigel da costa lewis carefully details the indisputable truths surrounding many of the behavioral biases that induce risk. he exposes the fallacy of the wisdom of experts, explains why you cannot rely on regulators, outlines the characteristics of the ""glad game,"" and demonstrates how high intelligence or lack thereof can lead to loss of hard-earned wealth. he also discusses the weaknesses and failures of modern risk management. moving on to elements often overlooked by risk managers, dr. lewis traces the link between corporate governance and risk management. he then covers core lessons surrounding the role of risk managers as well as the difficult subject of integrated, single lens analysis of risk. the book also explores aspects of spreadsheet risk and draws on lessons learned in the information systems and software engineering communities to provide guidance on selecting the right risk management system. it concludes with a discussion on the most dominant of risk measures-value at risk. having a clear understanding about risk separates successful professionals, companies, and economies from history's forgotten failures. through examples and case studies, this thought-provoking book shows how the rules of risk can work to protect and enhance investor value. © 2012 by taylor & francis group, llc. all rights reserved."
"in the last decade, behavioral economics, borrowing from psychology and sociology to explain decisions inconsistent with traditional economics, has revolutionized the way economists view the world. but despite this general success, behavioral thinking has fundamentally transformed only one field of applied economics-finance. peter diamond and hannu vartiainen's behavioral economics and its applications argues that behavioral economics can have a similar impact in other fields of economics. in this volume, some of the world's leading thinkers in behavioral economics and general economic theory make the case for a much greater use of behavioral ideas in six fields where these ideas have already proved useful but have not yet been fully incorporated--public economics, development, law and economics, health, wage determination, and organizational economics. the result is an attempt to set the agenda of an important development in economics--an agenda that will interest policymakers, sociologists, and psychologists as well as economists. contributors include ian ayres, b. douglas bernheim, truman f. bewley, colin f. camerer, anne case, michael d. cohen, peter diamond, christoph engel, richard g. frank, jacob glazer, seppo honkapohja, christine jolls, botond koszegi, ulrike malmendier, sendhil mullainathan, antonio rangel, emmanuel saez, eldar shafir, sir nicholas stern, jean tirole, hannu vartiainen, and timothy d. wilson. © 2007 by princeton university press. all rights reserved."
"overconfidence is used to explain various instances of detrimental decision making. in behavioral economic and finance models, it is usually captured by misperceiving the reliability of signals and results in overweighting private information. empirical tests of these models often fail to find evidence for the predicted effects of overconfidence. these studies assume, however, that a specific type of overconfidence, i.e. "" miscalibration,"" captures the underlying trait. we challenge this assumption and borrow the psychological methodology of single-cue probability learning to obtain a direct measure for misperceiving signal reliability. our findings indicate that the perception of signal precision and measures of miscalibration are unrelated. we thus conclude that in order to test the theoretical predictions of the overconfidence literature in economics and finance, one cannot rely on the well-established miscalibration bias. © 2011 elsevier b.v."

"consumer financial behavior is a domain between micro-economics, behavioral finance, and marketing. it is based on insights and behavioral theories from cognitive, economic, and social psychology (biases, heuristics, social influences), in the context of and sometimes in conflict with micro-economic theories of consumers, investors, and markets. behavioral finance has a descriptive approach, how people make financial decisions. not always rational, but often in a systematic irrational way. consumer financial behavior is also a basis and starting point for the marketing management of financial products and services, as well as for consumer education and protection policy. this monograph is on the determinants/drivers and consequences of spending, saving, borrowing, insuring, and investing. ultimately, this monograph is on the financial requirements for financial inclusion, and participation in present society with its myriad of products and services, experiences, social media, information (overload), and the pursuit of meaning, satisfaction, happiness, and wellbeing. © 2014 w. fred van raaij."
"purpose – the purpose of this paper is to empirically test dominant theories and assumptions in behavioral finance, using data from the standard & poor's 500 index. design/methodology/approach – the empirical analysis has three parts: to test the assumption of risk aversion; to examine the dominant theory that the optimal portfolio depends on risk preferences; and to test prospect theory that decision makers prefer certain outcomes over probable outcomes. finally, an alternative model to test prospect theory is introduced. findings – the proposed model is more flexible than prospect theory since it does not a priori assume what value of the portfolio induces risk aversion/seeking, while it does not a priori preclude linear preferences. empirical results show that: investors are risk seeking; a change in the sign of preferences does not necessarily imply a change in the sign of wealth/return and vice versa; and the optimal portfolio does not depend on preferences. practical implications – these findings are helpful to risk managers dealing with models of behavioural finance. originality/value – the contribution of this paper is that it successfully tests fundamental theories and assumptions in behavioral finance by providing a better alternative to prospect theory in several ways. © 2012, © emerald group publishing limited."
"one of the pillars of the finance theory is the efficient-market hypothesis, which is used to analyze the stock market. however, in recent years, this hypothesis has been questioned by a number of studies showing evidence of unusual behaviors in the returns of financial assets (""anomalies"") caused by behavioral aspects of the economic agents. therefore, it is time to initiate a debate about the efficient-market hypothesis and the ""behavioral finances."" we here introduce a cellular automaton model to study the stock market complexity, considering different behaviors of the economical agents. from the analysis of the stationary standard of investment observed in the simulations and the hurst exponents obtained for the term series of stock index, we draw conclusions concerning the complexity of the model compared to real markets. we also investigate which conditions of the investors are able to influence the efficient market hypothesis statements. © 2011 sociedade brasileira de física."
"in the last decade, behavioral economics, borrowing from psychology and sociology to explain decisions inconsistent with traditional economics, has revolutionized the way economists view the world. but despite this general success, behavioral thinking has fundamentally transformed only one field of applied economics-finance. peter diamond and hannu vartiainen'sbehavioral economics and its applicationsargues that behavioral economics can have a similar impact in other fields of economics. in this volume, some of the world's leading thinkers in behavioral economics and general economic theory make the case for a much greater use of behavioral ideas in six fields where these ideas have already proved useful but have not yet been fully incorporated--public economics, development, law and economics, health, wage determination, and organizational economics. the result is an attempt to set the agenda of an important development in economics--an agenda that will interest policymakers, sociologists, and psychologists as well as economists. contributors include ian ayres, b. douglas bernheim, truman f. bewley, colin f. camerer, anne case, michael d. cohen, peter diamond, christoph engel, richard g. frank, jacob glazer, seppo honkapohja, christine jolls, botond koszegi, ulrike malmendier, sendhil mullainathan, antonio rangel, emmanuel saez, eldar shafir, sir nicholas stern, jean tirole, hannu vartiainen, and timothy d. wilson. © 2007 by princeton university press. all rights reserved."
"background: food service directors have a concern that federal reimbursement is not meeting the demands of increasing costs of healthier meals. the purpose of this article is to report the food option changes and the annual revenues and expenses of the school food service environment. methods: the healthy study was a 3-year (2006 to 2009) randomized, cluster-designed trial conducted in 42 middle schools at 7 field centers. the schools selected had at least 50% of students who were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch or who belonged to a minority group. a randomly assigned half of the healthy schools received a school health intervention program consisting of 4 integrated components: nutrition, physical activity, behavioral knowledge and skills, and social marketing. the nutrition component consisted of changing the meal plans to meet 5 nutrition goals. revenue and expense data were collected from income statements, federal meal records, à la carte sale sheets, school store sale sheets, donated money/food records, and vending machines. results: although more intervention schools reached the nutritional goals than control schools, revenues and expenses were not significantly different between groups. conclusion: the healthy study showed no adverse effect of school food policies on food service finances. © 2012, american school health association."
"we investigate whether low-priced stocks drive long-term contrarian performance on the u.k. market. we find that contrarian performance at low, middle, and high price levels is positive. on the fama-french risk adjusted basis, we find both low-priced and middle-priced losers have significantly positive returns. when we adjust returns by market and liquidity risk, only middle-priced losers maintain their positive returns. our results reveal that low-priced stocks are not fully responsible for contrarian performance. our empirical evidence is generally consistent with the overreaction hypothesis and behavioral models of value investing. © 2012, the eastern finance association."

"a number of behavioral finance theories posit that investors adhere to prior beliefs in spite of new information. this paper reports the results of an investment experiment which shows that subjects' inferences are biased by their prior beliefs in a manner that depends on investment outcomes. specifically, survey responses and investment behavior indicate that subjects' perception of new information was more positively biased for their previously favored assets when incurring losses than gains. this asymmetric bias may help explain empirical patterns such as loser momentum and suggests modifications to models of belief persistence in markets. © 2012 world scientific publishing company and midwest finance association."
"volatility asymmetry is an important phenomenon in finance market, which is also the focus of financial theory and practice. according to some theoretical work on prospect theory in behavioral finance, it is constructed a price equilibrium model with investors making decision based on prospect theory. the main conclusion is that volatility asymmetry could be understood better, and the presence of loss aversion investors causes the asymmetric in different information environments, especially adding the ""house money effect"" induces the larger volatility. so these results above show that volatility asymmetry could be explained by prospect theory better."
"this paper studies the egyptian stock market (egx) as a distinct market within the framework of momentum and contrarian strategies. the main empirical findings of the study can be summarized as follows: first, evidence of the existence of momentum and contrarian profits: (1) the momentum/under reaction hypothesis, extreme movements in portfolio return will be followed by subsequent return movements in the same direction, (2) the contrarian/overreaction hypothesis, extreme movements in portfolio return will be followed by subsequent return movements in the opposite direction, (3) the short-term momentum and long-term reversals are not likely to be components of the same phenomenon. second, the failure of the conventional single model to explain the momentum and contrarian profits; the strength of these strategies is not built on differences in risk. finally, partial support of the relationship between momentum and contrarian profits and market states; investors could improve their investment performance by using a momentum strategy when the market state is up and a contrarian strategy when the market state is down. in general, the results present a violation of the concept of market efficiency and a support of the behavioral finance models. © eurojournals publishing, inc. 2012."

(2) primarily through channels such as investment, financing, mergers and acquisitions, the managers' overconfidence impacts on corporate value. (3) there is a significant negative correlation between managers' overconfidence and enterprise value. in other words, managers' overconfidence reduces corporate value though overinvestment, underinvestment, debt financing, and frequent mergers and acquisitions."

"this paper employs the autoregressive conditional jump intensity model, incorporating a forecast error, to investigate the relationships between the changes in the implied volatility and the relevant determinants in the taiwan market. we further apply the orthogonality test to explore forecast error and content of information. the empirical results show that the changes in the implied volatility are affected by the contemporaneous returns, lagged returns, lagged changes in the implied volatility, contemporaneous daily changes in the realized volatility and lagged forecast error. at the same time, these results are consistent with the behavioral explanations of hibbert et al. [journal of banking and finance (2008) vol. 32, pp. 2254-2266]. we also demonstrate that the implied volatility in taiwan seems to be an efficient forecast of future realized volatility during the whole of the sample period, except for the financial crisis period. © 2012 korean securities association."
"we investigate the generality of the bubble and crash price pattern observed in previous asset market experiments. the deviation of prices from fundamental values can be explained by either a failure of subjects to backward induct, a learning effect, or some other explanation. we conduct experiments with a longer horizon of 200 periods to find a possible reason for the timing of the crash. if the reason for the crash is the inability of subjects to backward induct, a long bubble should be observed. if, on the other hand, it is a learning effect, then the crash should occur after approximately 13 periods. our results show that while prices generally deviate from fundamental values, price patterns are different than in the 15-period markets, featuring multiple bubbles and crashes. © the institute of behavioral finance."
"perceived risks and benefits of quitting smoking may be important factors in successful treatment. this study examined the association between initial perceived risks and benefits of quitting smoking and outcomes during a two month smoking cessation attempt. participants (n=185) were treatment-seeking smokers attending two smoking cessation clinics in klang valley, malaysia. they received structured behavioral therapy and free nicotine replacement therapy (nrt). prior to treatment, a 12 item perceived risks and benefits questionnaire (prbq) was administered. this was used to assess the smoker's initial perceptions during their quit attempt. participants were re-contacted at the end of two months to determine their smoking status. the results show participants intending to quit demonstrated a greater understanding of the benefits of quitting smoking than the risks of quitting. those with a higher education level had a greater understanding of the benefits of quitting (p=0.02). prbq items, such as perceived risks of quitting (ie weight gain, negative affect, social ostracism, loss of enjoyment and craving) were not associated with abstinence at two months. however, those who perceived a benefit of higher physical attraction post-cessation were less likely to have stopped smoking at two months (or 0.18; 95%ci 0.08-0.45). other perceived benefits at baseline, such as health, general well-being, self-esteem, finances and social approval, were not associated with smoking cessation at two months. the results suggest that in our study population, smokers' baseline perceptions of the benefits of cessation of smoking prior to therapy are not associated with quit results at two months. counseling patients regarding the advantages and disadvantages of quitting may have changed their perceptions during quitting process and should be further explored in future studies."

"we test whether large but purely nominal shocks affect real asset market prices. we subject a laboratory asset market to an exogenous shock, which either inflates or deflates the nominal fundamental value of the asset while holding the real fundamental value constant. after an inflationary shock, nominal prices adjust upward rapidly, and we observe no real effects. however, after a deflationary shock, nominal prices display considerable inertia and real prices adjust only slowly and incompletely toward the levels that would prevail in the absence of a shock. thus, an asymmetry is observed in the price response to inflationary and deflationary nominal shocks. © the institute of behavioral finance."

"the disposition effect is the observation that investors tend to realize gains more than losses. this behavior is puzzling because it cannot be explained by traditional finance theories. a standard explanation of the disposition effect refers to prospect theory and, in particular, to the asymmetric risk aversion, according to which investors are risk-averse when faced with gains and risk-seeking when faced with losses. we show that for reasonable parameter values, the disposition effect cannot, however, be explained by prospect theory. the reason is that those investors who sell winning stocks and hold losing assets would not have invested in stocks in the first place. that is, the standard prospect theory argument is sound ex-post, assuming that the investment occurred, but not ex-ante, requiring also that the investment has to be made in the first place. © the institute of behavioral finance."
"the apparent limitations of rational decision-making have become increasingly important phenomena that are unexplained by traditional economic models. initial research found that these anomalies were not just random deviations from normative models, but actually, systematic physiologically driven psychological processes. behavioral finance and economics that emerged as biopsychological fields began to explain how people actually use information when making financial decisions. in the past, behavioral economic research has relied on extrapolation. choice could only be inferred from observed outcomes through behavior. recently, neuroscience, as powered by in-vivo brain imaging and our understanding of brain biology, has allowed scientists to more directly examine the internal landscape of decision-making. a literature review of applied clinical neuroscience and neuroeconomics yields a new perspective on decision-making-one that is driven by objective data. these data are generated by means of newly developed tools. however, these tools come with well-defined strengths and weaknesses. understanding the technological constraints is critical to appropriate data interpretation and future model building. this review addresses two different and independent brain operations: the reflexive automatic process and the reflective deliberate process. the meso-limbic and meso-cortical systems, which underlie each operation, are essential to understanding decision-making in the light of the emotional, learning, memory, and executive processes involved in decision-making. a significant amount of work has been devoted to studies of the neurotransmitter system involving dopamine (da). dopamine seems to emerge as a key player in decision-making due to the association it holds with reward, attention, motivation, and error assessment brain processes. in addition, da, in concert with other neurotransmitters and neuro-modulators, influences affective states that play a significant role in regulating physiological and psychological homeostasis. an individual's intrinsic processes that are genetically influenced and modulated to regulate homeostasis will consequently impact acute sensitivities as related to rewards and punishments. thus, the threshold and tolerance for reward and punishment are strongly associated with the decision-making. in line with the growing body of neuroeconomic research, this review presents the neuroscientific underpinnings of information processing and decision-making. the conclusions are not about the rational decision model being wrong, but rather about its potential limitations in light of new biologically driven data. © 2011 springer science+business media, llc."

"leverage is strongly related to liquidity in a market and lack of liquidity is considered a cause and/or consequence of the recent financial crisis. a repurchase agreement is a financial instrument where a security is sold simultaneously with an agreement to buy it back at a later date. repurchase agreement (repo) market size is a very important element in calculating the overall leverage in a financial market. therefore, studying the behavior of repo market size can help to understand a process that can contribute to the birth of a financial crisis. we hypothesize that herding behavior among large investors led to massive over-leveraging through the use of repos, resulting in a bubble (built up over the previous years) and subsequent crash in this market in early 2008. we use the johansenledoitsornette (jls) model of rational expectation bubbles and behavioral finance to study the dynamics of the repo market that led to the crash. the jls model qualifies a bubble by the presence of characteristic patterns in the price dynamics, called log-periodic power law (lppl) behavior. we show that there was significant lppl behavior in the market before that crash and that the predicted range of times predicted by the model for the end of the bubble is consistent with the observations. © 2011 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved."
"frankfurt's (2005. on bullshit. princeton: princeton university press) having given the term 'bullshit' philosophical respectability is quite timely for an understanding of the financial services industry. there is no doubt a preponderance of financial bullshitting nowadays, much more in fact than in the not so distant past. some of this might indeed be as harmful as frankfurt claims bullshit can be. on the other hand, in financial services as in many other human activities, bullshit is not only inevitable, but it also performs a variety of useful functions for individuals and for society. as a species, we may not have evolved to the point of making optimal probabilistic decisions in the stock market, as behavioral finance consistently illustrates, but we have certainly evolved enough to bullshit about it. we have also evolved the ability to detect financial bullshit, which may serve to mitigate its deleterious consequences. © 2012 copyright taylor and francis group, llc."
"conceptualizing drug abuse within the framework of behavioral theories of choice highlights the relevance of environmental variables in shifting behavior away from drug-related purchases. choosing to use drugs results in immediate and certain consequences (e.g., drug high and relief from withdrawal), whereas choosing abstinence typically results in delayed, and often uncertain, consequences (e.g., improved health, interpersonal relationships, money). methods: this is a selective review of the literature on contingency management (cm). results: we highlight a variety of methods to deliver cm in practical, effective, and sustainable ways. we consider a number of parameters that are critical to the success of monetary-based cm, and the role of the context in influencing cm's effects. to illustrate the broad range of applications of cm, we also review different methods for arranging contingencies to promote abstinence and other relevant behavior. finally, we discuss some considerations about how drug-dependent individuals allocate their finances in the context of cm interventions. conclusions: contingency management (cm) increases choice for drug abstinence via the availability of immediate, financial-based gains, contingent on objective evidence of abstinence. © 2012 informa healthcare usa, inc."
"a total of 86 financial managers participated in an experiment designed to assess the reliability of level 3 fair value (u.s. gaap) and entity-specific (ifrs) measurements of performance obligations. the study focuses on asset retirement obligations because, to date, under u.s. gaap they are the sole performance obligation measured at fair value. the findings indicate that with a benchmark, managers tend to manage earnings less with fair value measurements than entity-specific measurements. in contrast, without a benchmark, managers tend to manage earnings irrespective of whether the obligation is measured using fair value or entity-specific value. findings suggest that to the extent ifrs entity-specific measurements are associated with internally derived benchmarks, they may be more reliable than level 3 fair value u.s. gaap measurements that will not have benchmarks. © the institute of behavioral finance."

"advances in entrepreneurial finance brings together contributions from researchers from the fields of entrepreneurship, behavioral finance, psychology, and neuroscience to shed new light on the dynamics of decision making and risk taking by entrepreneurs and venture capitalists (vcs). every new venture requires access to capital at competitive interest rates, and much has been written on general entrepreneurship by management scholars and financial contracting by financial economists using traditional finance theory with all its highly restrictive assumptions regarding decision makers' cognitive capabilities and behavior. but recent developments in behavioral finance can now be applied to understand how entrepreneurs and vcs perceive risk and uncertainty and how they decide and act accordingly. showcasing the latest research, this volume demonstrates that findings from the behavioral and neuroscience arenas can and do explain decision making by entrepreneurs and venture investors in the real world. consequently, such findings have practical implications not only for entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and their advisors, but also all government agencies and ngos that want to support product and technological innovation, capital formation, job creation, and economic development. © springer science+business media, llc 2011. all rights reserved."
"in order to investigate the relationship between risk preferences and the returns, three contrastive experiments were designed and carried out in the behavioral finance laboratory developed by ourselves in this paper. by questionnaire survey, investors were classified into three types: risk conservative, risk neutral and risk preference. we studied returns of tested investors in four conditions: continuously rising, continuously falling, intervention and not intervention. from the statistical analysis, we conclude that risk preference investors obtain higher returns than risk neutral investors, while the conservative investors get the lowest returns, when the market is intervened to consecutive rising or consecutive falling. when market rose after the first down, risk preference investors obtain lowest returns. in the balanced market, the preferences of investors have not much contribution to the returns. in whole invest period, the behavior of conservative investors correspond with disposition effect, but not the preference investors. © 2011 ieee."
"we present the results of a simple, easily replicable, survey study based on lottery bonds. it is aimed at testing whether agents make investment decisions according to expected utility, cumulative prospect theory or optimal expectations theory, when they face skewed distributions of returns. we show that more than 55% of the 245 participants obey optimal expectations theory. they choose a distribution of payoffs dominated for second-order stochastic dominance and which would not be chosen according to cumulative prospect theory, for a large range of parameter values. as by-products of this study, we illustrate that agents use heuristics when they choose numbers at random and have, in general, a poor opinion about the rationality of others. © the institute of behavioral finance."
"the purpose of this article is to study whether an individual investor's affect towards a company causes him extra motivation to invest in the company's stock, over and beyond expected financial returns and risk. the authors examine survey data from 400 investors. they find that most investors had affect-based, extra motivation to invest in stocks, over and beyond financial return expectations. the more positive an individual's attitude towards the company was, the stronger was his extra investment motivation. moreover, a special affective relationship that an investor may have towards a company-affective self-affinity-can further explain the extra investment motivation. © the institute of behavioral finance."
"objectives: to examine overall cognitive screening results and the relationship between cognitive screen score and sociodemographic characteristics, reason for referral, and clinical outcomes of older veterans referred by primary care for a behavioral health assessment. design: cross-sectional, naturalistic study. setting: primary care clinics affiliated with two va medical centers. participants: the sample included 4,325 older veterans referred to the behavioral health laboratory who completed an initial mental health/substance abuse assessment. veterans were categorized into the following three groups on the basis of cognitive status: within normal limits, possible cognitive impairment, and possible dementia. measurements: sociodemographic and clinical data on reason for referral, cognitive functioning (i.e., blessed orientation-memory-concentration test), and behavioral health assessment outcomes were extracted from patients' medical records. data were analyzed using multiple linear and logistic regressions. results: results of cognitive screenings indicated that the majority of the sample was within normal limits (62.5%), with 25.8%, 8.1%, and 3.6% of patients evidencing possible cognitive impairment, possible dementia, and blessed orientation-memory- concentration scores of 17 or more, respectively. with regard to reason for referral, patients with greater cognitive impairment were more likely to be identified by the antidepressant case finder than patients with less impairment. increased age, non-white ethnicity, self-perceived inadequate finances, major depressive disorder, and symptoms of psychosis were associated with greater cognitive impairment. conclusions: findings highlight the importance of evaluating cognitive status in older adults who are referred for a behavioral health assessment and/or receive a new mental health/substance abuse diagnosis. doing so has the potential to improve recognition and treatment of cognitive impairment and dementia, thereby improving quality of care for many older adults. © 2012 american association for geriatric psychiatry."
"three central decisions in entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial finance-entry/seed funding, financing/investment, and growth/exit-are discussed and case is made for applying the behavioral finance theories and concepts to better understand the involved decision processes, and consequently, to help improve the decision-making process for both entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. the behavioral finance approach is important because the traditional finance has remained silent on the first issue, and the agency theory (financial contracting), which is effectively the only theory that is applicable to issues in entrepreneurial finance, has produced mixed empirical results. (see for example bitler et al.

"this paper empirically investigates the relation between stock mispricing, the compensation of executives and directors, and corporate investment using australian data. we find no significant relation between investment level and stock mispricing as measured by the nonfundamental component in the firm's q ratio. we also document a significant positive relation between the magnitude of equity-based compensation, measured as the percentage of the market value of a firm's equity, and the investment level. the results suggest that managers make investment decisions that do not cater to stock market mispricing but rather that concern their equity-based compensation. © the institute of behavioral finance."
"mathematical descriptions of financial markets with respect to the efficient market hypothesis (emh) and fractal finance are now equally robust but emh still dominates. emh and other current paradigms are extended to accommodate situations having higher information complexity and interactions coupled with positive feedback. the ""herding behavior"" literature in finance marks a significant recognition that interdependent trader behavior may result in deviation from normal distribution of returns, as does ""chartist"" trading. further legitimization of the separate-but-equal status of emh and fractal finance is pursued. research on the nonlinear models giving theoretical underpinning to equations representing mirror markets as complex dynamical systems is encouraged. why some herdingand chartist-behaviors scale up and then die off whereas others result in significant crashes is explained. the buildup to the 2007 liquidity crisis offers an example of nonlinear scale-free dynamics. concepts from complexity science, econophysics, and scale-free theory are used to offer further explanation to physicists' mathematical treatments. © the institute of behavioral finance."
"this paper proposes that the january effect is at least partly explained by a behavioral framework based on optimistic expectations. the turn-of-the-year is hypothesized to be a time of renewed optimism. indeed, investor sentiment, as measured by the university of michigan's index of consumer confidence, peaks in january. thus, optimists are expected to bid up the stock prices of firms with higher levels of uncertainty in january. these firms will subsequently underperform as they disappoint investors during the remainder of the year. despite the disappointment, the january pattern persists due to the ""false hope syndrome"" described in the psychology literature. using forecast dispersion to proxy for uncertainty, the results are consistent with the optimism hypothesis. similar reasoning may help explain other anomalies. © the institute of behavioral finance."
"the recent u.s. financial crisis, the u.s. stock market crash of 1987, and other recent anomalies have seriously challenged fama's classic efficient capital markets hypothesis. these events have made it likely that future capital markets research will be enriched by the important role that human behavior plays in the success or failure of the financial markets. this paper examines the factors causing the recent crisis within the united states financial services sector, the degree to which it may be explained by efficient capital markets theory and the degree to which such behavioral finance concepts as noise, excessive volatility, fashion and fads, and irrational behavior compromise that theory. © 2012 the clute institute."
"investors are often concerned that managers might hide negative information in filings. with advances in textual analysis and widespread document availability, individuals can now easily search for phrases that might be red flags indicating questionable behavior. we examine the impact of 13 suspicious phrases identified by a barron's article in a large sample of 10-ks. there is evidence that phrases like unbilled receivables signal a firm may subsequently be accused of fraud. at the 10-k filing date, phrases like substantial doubt are linked with significantly lower filing date excess stock returns, higher volatility, and greater analyst earnings forecast dispersion. © the institute of behavioral finance."
"2008 world financial meltdown highlighted significant shortcomings on procedures used by the banking sector to provide credit to the real economy. a long period of indulgence granting personal loans and mortgages that boosted a credit bubble all over the world has been followed by an era of suspicion within the banking sector, precipitating the liquidity crunch and the credit squeeze to private agents. behavioral finance has emerged as an alternative approach to analyze efficiency on financial markets, revealing a world with less than fully rational investors and arbitrageurs limited by risk aversion, short time horizons and agency problems. in this paper we consider the possibility to extend behavioral finance topics such as investor sentiment, overconfidence, heuristics or herd instinct to analyze banks behavior when providing credit to private agents, and how the absence of arbitrageurs in the credit market could justify the role of public banking as a countercyclical policy maker."
"investor trading behaviors are always an important issue in behavioral finance and market supervision. this study examines the relationship between investor behavior and future market volatility. we first introduce a two-period olg model into the futures market, and develop an investor behavior model based on future contract price. we then extend the model to two scenarios: complete and incomplete information. we provide the equilibrium solution, and develop two hypotheses, which are tested with cuprum tick data in shanghai futures exchange (shfe). empirical results show that the two-period olg model for future market is consistent with the market situation in china. more specifically, investors with sufficient information such as institutional investors usually adopt the contrarian trading strategy, whereas investors with insufficient information, e. g., individual investors, usually adopt the momentum trading strategy. these findings reveal that investor behaviors in the chinese futures market are different from those of in the chinese stock market. © 2011 higher education press and springer-verlag berlin heidelberg."
dollar-cost averaging requires investing equal amounts of an investment sum step-by-step in regular time intervals. previous studies that assume expected utility investors were unable to explain the popularity of dollar-cost averaging. statman [1995] argues that dollar-cost averaging is consistent with the positive framework of behavioral finance. we assume a prospect theory investor who implements a strategic asset allocation plan and has the choice to shift the portfolio immediately (comparable to a lump sum) or on a step-by-step basis (dollar-cost averaging). our simulation results support statman's [1995] notion that dollar-cost averaging may not be rational but a perfectly normal behavior. © the institute of behavioral finance.
"this study attempts to discover and evaluate the predictive power of stock micro blog sentiment on future stock price directional movements. we construct a set of robust models based on sentiment analysis and data mining algorithms. using 72,221 micro blog postings for igog stock tickers and 3874 distinct authors, our study reveals not only that stock micro blog sentiments do have predictive power for simple and market-adjusted returns respectively, but also that this predictive accuracy is consistent with the underreaction hypothesis observed in behavioral finance. we establish that stock micro blog with its succinctness, high volume and real-time features do have predictive power over future stock price movements. furthermore, this study provides support for the model of irrational investor sentiment, recommends a complimentary investing approach using user-generated content and validates an instrument that may contribute to the monetization schemes for virtual investing communities. © (2011) by the ais/icis administrative office all rights reserved."
"what causes men and women to behave differently in financial matters? gender differences in financial decisions and behaviors have been well-documented in popular media and the managerial press. the academic literature supports the notion of gender differences in investing, pointing out that male investors tend to make the high-consequence financial decisions in households and are the more risk tolerant and self-confident investors. yet few studies have empirically connected these conditions to differences in the information acquisition behavior of male and female investors. this paper examines whether differences exist in the information sources and the frequency of their use among male and female investors and identifies demographic and attitudinal characteristics that could cause differences in information search strategies. © the institute of behavioral finance."
"a salient trend during the current economic crisis is the increasing number of consumers paying closer attention to their spending and saving habits in efforts to control their finances. not surprisingly, these same uncertain times are witnessing the growth not only of financial planning services, but of financial counseling and therapy. accompanying the move toward professional standards and an academic research base is the need for a reliable source of quality assessment tools for use with clients, for research, and for training. financial planning and counseling scales admirably fills this need by collecting a diverse range of instruments specifically designed for the financial fields. the majority of the scales here have never been published in any other manuals or handbooks, appearing only in peer-reviewed journals or, in some cases, dissertations. this timely volume: reproduces over 280 scales useful across a variety of circumstances provides key details for each scale, including source, purpose, test sample, scoring information, and discussion of reliability and validity clearly defines financial counseling/therapy as a field of study and practice (particularly in the context of marriage and family therapy) and establishes the role of psychometric assessment summarizes a range of theoretical models (e.g., cognitive-behavioral, solution-focused, systems) for financial therapy offers guidelines for evaluating scales, and for constructing original instruments financial planning and counseling scales is a first-of-its-kind resource for researchers, educators, and practitioners in family and consumer economics, personal finance, household finance, and financial therapy as these domains evolve."
"the efficient markets hypothesis (emh) was dealt a fatal blow by the financial crisis of 2007-2009, out of which we have witnessed a revival of keynesian conceptions of the financial markets. exemplifying this trend is the rising influence of behavioral finance. but if emh exaggerates the rational side of human nature, behavioral finance goes too far in reducing us to slaves of the emotions. in search of a middle way, we explore the writings of l. albert hahn, a german banker and investor who made his name in the mid-20th century as a critic of keynesian economics. grounded on an austrian understanding of the business cycle and uncertainty, hahn depicts the stock market as being overwhelmingly inhabited by investors whose thinking is constrained by mass opinion. while this generates sustained irrational price movements, deviations from fair values are eventually corrected in a market process led by a few, independently minded investors. in hahn's view, financial markets are neither efficient nor animally spirited, but eventually adjusting."
"this article discusses the behavioral implications of the black-litterman model. in behavioral finance, the utility function of the investor is reference-based, and investors estimate losses and gains in relation to this benchmark. implications drawn from past research within the field indicate and explain why the portfolio output given by the black-litterman model appears more intuitive to fund managers than portfolios generated by the markowitz model. another feature of the black-litterman model is that the user assigns levels of confidence associated with each asset view in the form of confidence intervals. people are overconfident in financial decision-making, particularly when stating confidence intervals, which is particularly problematic for this model. hence implications from research regarding overconfidence do not favor the use of confidence levels when weighting portfolios."
"this paper proposed a new technique which makes the strategy trees for the derivative (option) trading investment decision based on the behavioral finance theory and optimizes it using evolutionary computation, in order to achieve high profitability. the strategy tree uses a technical analysis based on a statistical, experienced technique for the investment decision. the trading model is represented by various technical indexes, and the strategy tree is optimized by the genetic programming(gp) which is one of the evolutionary computations. moreover, this paper proposed a method using the prospect theory based on the behavioral finance theory to set psychological bias for profit and deficit and attempted to select the appropriate strike price of option for the higher investment efficiency. as a result, this technique produced a good result and found the effectiveness of this trading model by the optimized dealings strategy. © 2012 the institute of electrical engineers of japan."
"assuming the division of behavioral economics into old and new, the paper begins to argue that old behavioral economics began with the works of two giants - george katuna and herbert simon during the 1950s and early 1960s. the contributors of herbert simon are well established, thanks to the popularity of bounded rationality and satisficing, and his being award noble prize in economics. however, economists are much less familiar with the contributions of george katona that can be viewed as the father of behavioral economics. furthermore, the author argues that katona was also misunderstood by various economists when he was attempting to create a psychologically based economics that rejected the mechanistic psychology of neoclassical economics and introducing the survey method to economic research that he had been using in his experimental psychology research previously. he also had influenced various economists during their debates in the 1950s without given the credit for. many historians of behavioral economics limit katona's contributions to the start of behavioral economics only to his contributions to macroeconomics. however, the paper demonstrates that katona's behavioral economics included his contributions to macroeconomics (bringing realism to keynesian consumption function and consumption behavior), micro-economics (business behavior, the rationality assumption, etc.), public finance and economic policy, and his introduction of the survey method. to demonstrate these contributions, the author argues that katona attempted to bring realism to economic analysis - through psychological concepts - beginning with his early days of research in germany which coincided with german hyper inflation- and continued whether working at new school for social research, chicago university's cowles commission, the u.s. department of agriculture, or the university of michigan's survey research center. the author also argues that katona's contributions went through stages, depending upon what economic problem persisted at the time, what advertises he was facing, and what institution/organization he was associated with. © 2011 elsevier inc."
"this study investigates the impact of multiple information sources. specifically, we examine whether single and multiple earnings forecasts may differentially influence investors' expectations. we focus on two main aspects of investors' expectations: (a) predictions of future eps and (b) subjective confidence about their own predictions. we conduct an experiment where we hold information content constant and ask participants to evaluate multiple earnings forecasts or a single earnings estimate. results from the experiment suggest that multiple information sources improve participants' confidence, and participants are most confident when they receive multiple earnings forecasts with no variability. however, their confidence diminishes when variability in the multiple forecasts increases. evidence from this study indicates that multiple information sources outperform the single source only when multiple reports have highly consistent information. © the institute of behavioral finance."

"h.r. 3970, introduced in the 110th congress by then-chairman charles rangel of the house committee on ways and means, includes corporate tax revisions, trading a lower rate for a broader tax base as part of the revenue neutral reform package. s. 3018, introduced by senators ron wyden and judd gregg in the 111th congress, also provides for a lower corporate tax rate in exchange for a somewhat broader corporate tax base. some discussions by economists in opinion pieces suggest there is an urgent need to lower the corporate tax rate, but not necessarily to broaden the tax base. arguments for lowering the corporate tax rate include the traditional concerns about economic distortions arising from the corporate tax and newer concerns arising from the increasingly global nature of the economy. some claims have been made that lowering the corporate tax rate would raise revenue because of the behavioral responses, an effect that is linked to an open economy. although the corporate tax has generally been viewed as contributing to a more progressive tax system because the burden falls on capital income and thus on higher income individuals, claims have also been made that the burden falls not on owners of capital, but on labor income-an effect also linked to an open economy. the analysis in this report suggests that many of the concerns expressed about the corporate tax are not supported by empirical data. claims that behavioral responses could cause revenues to rise if rates were cut do not hold up on either a theoretical basis or an empirical basis. studies that purport to show a revenue maximizing corporate tax rate of 30% (a rate lower than the current statutory tax rate) contain econometric errors that lead to biased and inconsistent results; when those problems are corrected the results disappear. cross-country studies to provide direct evidence showing that the burden of the corporate tax actually falls on labor yield unreasonable results and prove to suffer from econometric flaws that also lead to a disappearance of the results when corrected, in those cases where data were obtained and the results replicated. similarly, claims that high u.s. tax rates will create problems for the united states in a global economy suffer from a misrepresentation of the u.s. tax rate compared to other countries and are less important when capital is imperfectly mobile, as it appears to be. although these new arguments appear to rely on questionable methods, the traditional concerns about the corporate tax appear valid. while an argument may be made that the tax is still needed as a backstop to individual tax collections, it does result in some economic distortions. these economic distortions, however, have declined substantially over time as corporate rates and shares of output have fallen. moreover, it is difficult to lower the corporate tax without creating a way of sheltering individual income given the low rates of tax on dividends and capital gains. a number of revenue-neutral changes are available that could reduce these distortions, allow for a lower corporate statutory tax rate, and lead to a more efficient corporate tax system. these changes include base broadening, reducing the benefits of debt finance through inflation indexing, and reducing the tax at the firm level offset by an increase at the individual level. © 2011 nova science publishers, inc. all rights reserved."
"the legalization of american indian casino gaming in the late 1980s allows examination of the relationship between income and health in a quasi-experimental way. revenue from gaming accrues to individual tribes and has been used both to supplement tribe members' income and to finance tribal infrastructure. we assembled annual data from 1988-2003 on tribal gaming, health care access (from the area resource file), and individual health and socioeconomic characteristics data (from the behavioral risk factors surveillance system). we use this information within a structural, difference-in-differences framework to study the effect of casino gaming on tribal members' income, health status, access to health care, and health-related behaviors. our difference-in-differences framework relies on before-after comparisons among american indians whose tribe has at some time operated a casino and with-without comparisons between american indians whose tribe has and those whose tribe has not initiated gaming. our results provide identified estimates of the positive effect of gaming on american indian income and on several indicators of american indian health, health-related behaviors, and access to health care. © 2012 population association of america."
"this study examines the persistence of earnings performance, the contribution of accruals and cash flows in the persistence of earnings and whether investors correctly value the information contained in earnings, accruals and cash flows for equity pricing. thr authors use data for 493 companies on the bse from january 1997 to december 2010. the results support the high persistence of earnings for the sample firms and that the stock prices correctly reflect the implications of current earnings for future earnings. it is found that earnings persistence is more attributable to cash flows than accruals. however, the indian investors seem to under price accruals and overprice cash flows which is in contrast to findings for mature markets. accruals are found to be positively associated with future returns. the accrual anomaly is not captured by one factor capm but is fully explained by the three factor fama french model due to risk premium on the size factor. a negative relationship is reported between cash flows and returns which is again contrary to the results for mature markets. the cash flow anomaly which is not absorbed by capm is explained by the size and value factors of the fama french model. hence accruals and cash flow anomalies do not pose serious challenge to popular asset pricing models in the indian context. the findings will be highly useful for investment analysts and portfolio managers who are in pursuit of trading strategies that promise extra normal returns. the research contributes to asset pricing and behavioral finance literature especially for emerging markets. © sanjay sehgal, srividya subramaniam, florent deisting, 2012."

"the main purpose of this paper is to show that the lack of misreaction to common information in previous research may be due to methodological weakness. as of now, there is no evidence which suggests that stocks under-react to common information at short horizons and over-react at longer horizons. even if stocks under-and/or over-react to common information at the security level, the reaction pattern may not be evident at the market level if only some stocks have such a pattern and their capitalization is small. we show in this manuscript that the lack of misreaction to common information in previous research may be due to methodological weakness. by focusing on the stock level reaction, we find a statistically and economically significant reaction pattern to common information as the behavioral models suggest. this finding thus complements the findings of stock misreaction to firm-specific information, and may benefit researchers attempting to understand investor behavior. © 2011 world scientific publishing co. and center for pacific basin business, economics and finance research."

"this study examined the differences among lesbians, gay men, and heterosexuals at two points in time (1975 and 2000) using responses of 6,864 participants from two archival data sets. groups were compared on variables representing equality of behaviors between partners in seven realms: traditionally ""feminine"" housework, traditionally ""masculine"" housework, finances, support, communication, requesting/refusing sex, and decision-making. in addition, the current study compared monogamy agreements and monogamy behaviors reported by the two cohorts of couple types. overall, the results indicate that on the equality variables, there have been many statistically significant behavioral shifts among the different sexual orientations across 25 years. in addition, all couple types reported substantially greater rates of monogamy in the year 2000 than in 1975. the present study has important clinical implications for therapists working with couples because it provides new baseline evidence regarding how couples now interact with one another (especially about monogamy) and how this has shifted over time. in addition, it elucidates the differences that still exist between different couple types, which could serve to inform couple therapists as they strive to become more culturally competent working with same-sex couples. © 2011 fpi, inc."

"purpose: the purpose of this paper is to explore the links between entrepreneurial behavior and success factors in a developing country context. design/methodology/approach: a case study approach was selected to analyze real-life situations in order to gain an insight about entrepreneurial cognition and action related to success factors. drawing from the behavioral theory of entrepreneurship, this paper presents a conceptual model which shows that entrepreneurial cognitions about success factors may lead toward entrepreneurial actions. the data were collected through face-to-face interviews. three entrepreneurs were asked to outline responses to identified success factors such as start-up planning, managing risk, learning, networking, managing human resource, and managing finances. findings: the results suggest that many behavioral patterns exhibited by the case study entrepreneurs were similar to entrepreneurs' behavior in more developed regions. the similarities include: preparation of business plan, ability cognition for start-up planning, overconfidence and representativeness heuristics for managing risk, obtaining professional outsider assistance for learning, developing business relationships with suppliers for networking and favorable credit policies, and employing owner-related and delaying-payment methods of bootstrapping for managing finances. originality/value: for the first time in pakistan this study explores entrepreneurial cognition and action in managing success factors. the findings of the research will potentially help practitioners and policy makers in nurturing entrepreneurial initiatives in a developing country context. © emerald group publishing limited."

"corporate governance has become one of the most prominent topics for management scholars, top executives, and regulators alike over the last couple of decades. originally a domain of economics and finance (as well as law), the theme has spread to other areas such as strategic management and organization theory in recent years. this paper will first give a brief overview on major developments in the field of corporate governance. these developments encompass, on the one hand, the extension of the classical focus on formal systems and structures to perspectives that address behavioral as well as process issues. on the other hand, the terrain has been broadened from its traditional narrow interest in the principal agent problem between shareholders and management to the more comprehensive stakeholder approach of corporate governance. building on these developments, this paper will subsequently elaborate on a further extension of the topic by emphasizing the concept of stakeholder opportunism. the classical principal agent problem results from possible opportunistic behavior of the management, which compromises the interests of the shareholders. however, as the notion of stakeholder opportunism points out, not only the management of a company can exercise opportunism; rather, all stakeholders of a company can (and will to some extent) have options to behave opportunistically and at the same time bear the risk of being victims of the opportunism of other stakeholders. this paper develops a conceptual framework for analyzing the determinants and dynamics of the various stakeholders' opportunism options and risks as well as of the actual opportunistic behavior of stakeholders. employing this framework, implications of the notion of stakeholder opportunism for managers and regulators are discussed, and perspectives for further research are identified. ©2011 informs."

"in the first step, this paper briefly discusses the macroeconomic background of the 2008 financial crisis. next, we take a wider approach and we look at systemic changes that global economics, and financial markets in particular, had undergone. we wonder if these transformations, and their effects so dramatically demonstrated in 2008, give grounds to modify the theoretical background of finance. the neoclassical paradigm might be seen as an idealized normative benchmark. on the other hand, behavioral approach helps explain deviations from this benchmark, however itself it lacks the normative character. we conclude that in contemporary circumstances an interdisciplinary approach is needed in the search for an adequate theory, as the financial world is getting more and more complex and dynamic. © 2011."
"behavioral finance is a relatively new and developing research field which adopts cognitive psychology and emotional bias to explain the inefficient market phenomenon and some irrational trading decisions. unlike the experts in this field who tried to reason the price anomaly and applied empirical evidence in many different financial markets, we employ the advanced binary classification algorithms, such as adaboost and support vector machines, to precisely model the overreaction and strengthen the portfolio compositions of the contrarian trading strategies. the novelty of this article is to discover the financial time-series patterns through a high-dimensional and nonlinear model which is constructed by integrated knowledge of finance and machine learning techniques. we propose a dual-classifier learning framework to select candidate stocks from the past results of original contrarian trading strategies based on the defined learning targets. three different feature extraction methods, including wavelet transformation, historical return distribution, and various technical indicators, are employed to represent these learning samples in a 381-dimensional financial time-series feature space. finally, we construct the classifier models with four different learning kernels and prove that the proposed methods could improve the returns dramatically, such as the 3-year return that improved from 26.79% to 53.75%. the experiments also demonstrate significantly higher portfolio selection accuracy, improved from 57.47% to 66.41%, than the original contrarian trading strategy. to sum up, all these experiments show that the proposed method could be extended to an effective trading system in the historical stock prices of the leading u.s. companies of s&p 100 index. © 2011 acm."
"this study aims to explain the size effect in january with the utilization of some theoretical arguments drawn from behavioral finance, such as mental accounting and house money, in a chinese culture-oriented emerging stock market. under chinese tradition, employees are rewarded with a generous bonus before lunar new year, most often paid in january. this gain, analogous to the concept of house money, enhances the propensity to bear increased levels of risk, which in turn stimulates the demand for higher risk securities, particularly in a market that is mainly dominated by individual investors, as in taiwan. the empirical results are consistent with our culture bonus hypothesis, that only small firms with higher risk in the taiwanese stock market exhibit the apparent size effect in january, especially for the years when the bonus payments were in january and when the whole market had positive performance growth in the preceding year. © 2010 elsevier b.v."
"as extensively documented in literature, stock investors are not fully rational in their trading decisions as many behavioral biases affect their actions. however, most of the behavioral finance literature has explained only empirical phenomena observed in financial markets; little attention has been paid to how technical investors' trading performance is affected by their behavioral biases. incorporating conservatism bias and disposition effect, we construct a model of moving average strategies to mimic technical trend followers. a comparative study is conducted by applying the model to historical data of sse index and hsi for the period from 12 jul. 1994 to 15 oct. 2010; findings with respect to different terms (time steps) of trend following and impact of the biases are drawn. it's found that trend-following strategies can remarkably beat both the markets, and trends exist in a shorter term for china stock market than for hong kong market. in contrast, downward trend following cannot produce consistent gains in either market. further, behavioral biases exert detrimental effects on traders chasing trends over shorter terms. © 2011 ieee."
"a new view of limited arbitrage is applied in the study of the reasons of stock price synchronicity in china based on the behavioral finance theory. this paper made an explorary study about the relation between limited arbitrage, stock price synchronicity and market efficiency. a conclusion different from the study about cash stock dividends in foreign countries is derived that cash dividends as a tunnel of dominant strockholders increase the holding cost of arbitragers, and affect stock price synchronicity, leading to low market efficiency. © 2011 ieee."
"purpose - this paper aims to identify traits of taiwanese investors that deviate from the typical rationale governing financial decisions, through the analysis of their asset preferences and investment criteria. it also highlights the post-modern portfolio theory to address the behavior of taiwanese investors found in our result and in other studies. design/methodology/approach - the time period between late 2007 and 2008 was our choice for this investigation, being a period of considerable volatility in the taiwanese market during a major political campaign and a downturn of the economy. we took into account the factors of market environment, investment amount, expected return rate, risk tolerance and investment type to investigate the relationship between these factors and investors' preferences when selecting assets such as mutual funds, stocks, bonds and foreign currency. the analytical hierarchy process (ahp) method was then employed to analyze the survey data. findings - risk tolerance is the most important factor for taiwanese investors when they design their asset portfolios. however, they prefer stocks to other assets. when market environment and risk tolerance are considered, mutual funds are chosen over and above stocks. whichever criterion is used, bonds turn out to be the least favored asset. originality/value - the ahp application for the purpose of this study has not been found. our analysis echoes the phenonmena of taiwan's investment markets known from previous studies. the result clearly provides evidence (e.g. irrational investment and risk-seeking behavior exhibited by taiwanese investors) applicable to the field of behavioral finance. © 2011 emerald group publishing limited. all rights reserved."

"school desegregation might have induced unintended behavioral responses of white families as well as state and local governments. this paper examines these responses and is the first to study the effects of desegregation on the finances of school districts. desegregation induced white flight from blacker to whiter public school districts and to private schools, but the local property tax base and local revenue were not adversely affected. the state legislature directed significant new funding to districts where whites were particularly affected by desegregation. desegregation therefore appears to have achieved its intended goal of improving resources available in schools that blacks attended. © 2011 by the president and fellows of harvard college and the massachusetts institute of technology."

"with increasing evidence challenging the efficient market hypothesis, there is a need for a unified methodology capable of quantifying the various, sometimes conflicting, effects suggested by behavioral finance. a paradigm for quantifying these effects is presented in this article. the authors review recent studies of large-scale new york stock exchange (nyse) data modeling the daily price change and formulate an augmented version of the methodology in which the impact of and over- or underreaction to news announcements are considered. variables that are more difficult to consider, such as the ""affect heuristic,"" are also considered within the context of this theory. © 2011 sage publications."
"we develop a panel intensity framework for the analysis of complex trading activity datasets containing detailed information on individual trading actions in different securities for a set of investors. a feature of the model is the presence of a time-varying latent factor, which captures the influence of unobserved time effects and allows for correlation across individuals. we contribute to the literature on market microstructure and behavioral finance by providing new results on the disposition effect and on the manifestation of risk aversion on the high-frequency trading level. these novel insights are made possible by the joint characterization of not only the decision to close (exit) a position, usually considered in isolation in the literature, but also the decision to open (enter) a position, which together describe the trading process in its entirety. while the disposition effect is defined with respect to the willingness to realize profits/losses with respect to the performance of the position under consideration, we find that the performance of the total portfolio of positions is an additional factor influencing trading decisions that can reinforce or dampen the standard disposition effect. moreover, the proposed methodology allows the investigation of the strength of these effects for different groups of investors ranging from small retail investors to professional and institutional investors. © the author 2011. published by oxford university press. all rights reserved."

"the present work studies the optimal insurance policy offered by an insurer adopting a proportional premium principle to an insured whose decision-making behavior is modeled by kahneman and tversky's cumulative prospect theory with convex probability distortions. we show that, under a fixed premium rate, the optimal insurance policy is a generalized insurance layer (that is, either an insurance layer or a stop-loss insurance). this optimal insurance decision problem is resolved by first converting it into three different sub-problems similar to those in jin and zhou (2008); however, as we now demand a more regular optimal solution, a completely different approach has been developed to tackle them. when the premium is regarded as a decision variable and there is no risk loading, the optimal indemnity schedule in this form has no deductibles but a cap; further results also suggests that the deductible amount will be reduced if the risk loading is decreased. as a whole, our paper provides a theoretical explanation for the popularity of limited coverage insurance policies in the market as observed by many socio-economists, which serves as a mathematical bridge between behavioral finance and actuarial science. © 2011 elsevier b.v."

"by using the relationship between high sentiment and momentum, the main purpose of this paper is to investigate if psychological biases of investors have an influence on behavioral biases. we find that in the china stock market, high sentiment of loser groups is correlated with contributors of momentum profits, while high sentiment of winner groups is correlated with contributors of contrarian returns. further analysis indicates that, the higher the investor psychological bias is, the greater the momentum return will become. winners/losers that are most sensitive to sentiment and having the longest duration of being kept under the situation will result in higher returns. © 2011 world scientific publishing co. and center for pacific basin business, economics and finance research."
"how useful are ""corporate brands"" in markets? in theory, brands convey reliable information, providing consumers with shortcuts to time-consuming provider searches. we examine the usefulness of a corporate brand when parental school choice is expanded through k-12 tuition scholarships. specifically, we evaluate whether catholic schools carry an identifiable education brand (1) preferred even by non-catholics, (2) for reasons connected to the brand, (3) signaling largely accurate information resulting in an enduring ""match"" of school characteristics to student needs, and (4) leading to exit from the program when a catholic school fails to meet consumers' brand expectations. we test these hypotheses using attitudinal and behavioral data from a scholarship program in washington, dc. the results largely confirm our hypotheses about the catholic school brand being attractive, familiar, generally accurate, and, when not accurate, an instigator of programmatic attrition-results that speak to enduring policy issues involving school choice. © 2011 association for education finance and policy."
"primary malignant brain tumors (pmbts) have a unique treatment and disease trajectory as compared to other cancers. having a brain tumor not only subjects the patients to issues inherent in a cancer diagnosis (e.g., side effects from chemotherapy and radiation) but often causes significant neurologic deficits that interfere with daily life and function. neurologic deficits can include physical deficits as well as cognitive decline in memory, attention, language and communication, executive function, reasoning, judgment, and mental flexibility (sherwood et al., 2006). the presence of these complications leads to many difficulties for family caregivers of those with pmbt. for example, patients often are forced to quit their jobs upon diagnosis, which requires the family caregivers to maintain employment to ensure medical benefits. neurologic dysfunction, such as memory loss or inappropriate behavior, may limit the number of social activities the dyad may engage in and typically increases household responsibilities, such as managing finances, for the caregiver. to provide the best possible care to the patient, caregivers' needs and concerns must be acknowledged to minimize the stress and burden they experience. research has shown that providing care for patients with dementia produces negative psychological and behavioral (psychobehavioral) responses, such as depressive symptoms, caregiver burden, and altered sleep patterns (brummett et al., 2006). however, the majority of the studies have been cross-sectional and do not address how and when caregiver distress emerges in the care situation. in addition, almost no attention has been paid to caregivers of patients with pmbt. the purpose of the current study was to examine the transition from family member to caregiver and to explore changes in caregivers' perceptions of that transition during the first four months following diagnosis. these data are vital for implementing the most efficient and effective interventions to improve caregiver health by providing the necessary support during the transition of becoming a family caregiver."
"according to behavioral finance theories, in this article we develop a dynamic model with heterogeneous traders, where the asset price is determined by the interaction among four different groups of agents: trend reversers, trend followers, risk averters and risk seekers. the main purpose of the study is centered on modeling and testing how the market efficiency changes along with the changes of agent's behavior preference without exogenous influence. combining with the assumption of risk appetite and prospect theory, focusing on analyzing the rules for selecting strategies, we establish a more reliable and comprehensive dynamic mechanism. in particular, our study suggests that diversified trading strategies will help to realize market efficiency. © 2010 springer-verlag."
"utility is a concept used by economic theory to characterize human decision-making. project financing implies a complex decision-making process that is based on an agent's choice of financial sources. selecting between various financing options is guided by risk and reward. these two criteria make up the value of each project financing option. the differences of value between options offering various utilities to the subject are the ones that set in motion the entire decision-making mechanism. the one that offers the highest utility is preferred to ""homo oeconomicus"". this is characterized by rational behavior, directed towards maximizing its utility and lays the foundation of the classical economic theory. modern economic theories such as game theory or behavioral finance reveal different facets of human decision behavior. agent-based modeling uses the synergy between the classical and modern theories to simulate decisionmaking process."

"purpose: the purpose of this paper is to explore how loyalty marketers are inspiring and incentivizing consumers to stay healthy in the wake of sky-rocketing health care costs and a new us health care bill. design/methodology/approach: the paper's approach is to tap into well-known wellness program providers, like virgin healthmiles, cigna and cvs caremark, to provide insight into how marketers are looking to utilize the ""carrot"" (positive incentives) to inspire consumers to stay healthy rather than the stick (punishment). findings: the new health care legislation signed by president obama in march, the patient protection and affordable care act, has put a firm stamp of approval and support behind the use of incentives and rewards by health and wellness programs. in effect, loyalty marketing tactics are becoming a more important tool than ever in health care reform. most noticeably, beginning in 2014, employers will be able to offer their workers an increased amount of rewards, worth up to 30-50 percent of their health coverage costs, for participating in a wellness program and meeting health benchmarks. in addition, health insurance companies will be required to implement health and wellness promotion activities. practical implications: deploying loyalty tactics by the ""carrot"" contingent has put into practice the growing disciplines of ""behavioral economics"" and ""choice architecture"" that have become hot topics over the past couple of years within various industries, including government and finance. best-selling books such as freakonomics and predictably irrational have focused on behavioral economics, defined as the use of social, cognitive and emotional factors in understanding and influencing the decisions of individuals. digital tools are being used to create a handy consumer-direct link and motivational boost to the consumer-pharmacy relationship. wellq - a wellness behavior-change program developed by loyaltyone in partnership with the american pharmacists association - seeks to help patients shift their own behavior around their medications and health care, with the help of their retail pharmacy, where consumers sign up and provide a profile of medications and current health habits. through wellq, they then begin to receive mobile text-based reminders as well as bite-size educational and motivational content around self-care delivered to their cell phones. originality/value: the paper provides exclusive interviews with representatives from some of the largest wellness program providers in the industry today. it also gives tangible tips and tools to utilize in real-world marketing plans. © emerald group publishing limited."

"traditional public finance provides a powerful framework for policy analysis, but it relies on a model of human behavior that the new science of behavioral economics increasingly calls into question. in policy and choice economists william congdon, jeffrey kling, and sendhil mullainathan argue that public finance not only can incorporate many lessons of behavioral economics but also can serve as a solid foundation from which to apply insights from psychology to questions of economic policy. the authors revisit the core questions of public finance, armed with a richer perspective on human behavior. they do not merely apply findings from psychology to specific economic problems; instead, they explore how psychological factors actually reshape core concepts in public finance such as moral hazard, deadweight loss, and incentives. part one sets the stage for integrating behavioral economics into public finance by interpreting the evidence from psychology and developing a framework for applying it to questions in public finance. in part two, the authors apply that framework to specific topics in public finance, including social insurance, externalities and public goods, income support and redistribution, and taxation. in doing so, the authors build a unified analytical approach that encompasses both traditional policy levers, such as taxes and subsidies, and more psychologically informed instruments. the net result of this innovative approach is a fully behavioral public finance, an integration of psychology and the economics of the public sector that is explicit, systematic, rigorous, and realistic. copyright © 2011 the brookings institution."

"many papers on finance are interested in studying the preferences of a certain group of individuals about the choice of several rewards available at different time instants. usually these works are conducted from an experimental point of view by means of samples to be passed to a control group. one of the most important issues in this research is nonadditivity when describing the behavior in experimental intertemporal choice. for instance, subadditivity in behavioral finance means that a certain subject prefers to divide the duration of an investment as many times as possible because this choice leads to an increase in profitability. another context is medical research on impulsivity and loss of self-control in drug-dependent patients because there is a relationship between impulsive decision-making in intertemporal choice and estimation of time duration. here subadditivity appears when administering some drugs in a group of substance abusers because they can feel a slight improvement when the same dose is divided into several parts. the problem arising here is how to measure the degree of subadditivity or superadditivity perceived by a group of individuals who are not experts in finance or medicine, respectively. so, our research will be addressed from a nonlinearity of time-perception perspective. © 2010 wiley periodicals, inc."
"stock investors are not fully rational during their trading, and many behavioral biases affect their trading behavior, such as representative bias and disposition effect. however, most of the literature on behavioral finance cast efforts on explaining empirical phenomena observed in financial markets, but little on how individual investors' trading performance is affected by their behavioral biases. as against the common perception that behavioral biases are always detrimental to investment performance, we conjecture that these biases can sometimes yield better trading outcomes for investors. focusing on representative bias and disposition effect, we construct a mathematical model in which the representative investor follows a bayesian trading strategy based on an underlying markov chain, switching between trending regime and mean-reversion regime. by this model, we are able to undertake scenario analysis to track investor behavior and performance along the time, under different patterns of market movements. results validate our conjecture by showing that the effect of behavioral biases can sometimes be positive on investor performance."
"the capital asset pricing model (capm) and the mean-variance (m-v) rule, which are based on classic expected utility theory, have been heavily criticized theoretically and empirically. the advent of behavioral economics, prospect theory and other psychology-minded approaches in finance challenges the rational investor model from which capm and m-v derive. haim levy argues that the tension between the classic financial models and behavioral economics approaches is more apparent than real. this book aims to relax the tension between the two paradigms. specifically, professor levy shows that although behavioral economics contradicts aspects of expected utility theory, capm and m-v are intact in both expected utility theory and cumulative prospect theory frameworks. there is furthermore no evidence to reject capm empirically when ex-ante parameters are employed. professionals may thus comfortably teach and use capm and behavioral economics or cumulative prospect theory as coexisting paradigms. © haim levy 2012."

"the aim of this paper is to analyze the differences in innovation antecedents between large firms and smes. an empirical study including 202 companies in total, 92 smes and 110 large firms in manufacturing industry was carried out. the study reveals that efforts to achieve incorporation of innovation antecedents must take account of the effect of organizational size and should not promote an innovation program that includes standard innovation applications. the findings also indicate that large firms can control the antecedents that require greater resources particularly related to finance and skill such as innovation budget, skill level and variety and innovation culture to be innovative. on the other hand smes can control antecedents better that lie mostly in behavioral characteristics such as participation and ease of communication within the firm. © international journal of industrial engineering."
"the book that applies behavioral finance to the real world understanding how to use behavioral finance theory in investing is a hot topic these days. nobel laureate daniel kahneman has described financial advising as a prescriptive activity whose main objective should be to guide investors to make decisions that serve their best interests. the reality? that's easier said than done. in the second edition of behavioral finance and wealth management, michael pompian takes a practical approach to the growing science of behavioral finance, and puts it to use for real investors. he applies knowledge of 20 of the most prominent individual investor biases into “behaviorally-modified” asset allocation decisions. offering investors and financial advisors a “self-help” book, pompian shows how to create investment strategies that leverage the latest cutting edge research into behavioral biases of individual investors. this book: shows investors and financial advisors how to either moderate or adapt to behavioral biases, in order to improve investment results and identifies “the best practical allocation” for investment portfolios. using these two sound approaches for guiding investment decision-making, behavioral biases are incorporated into the portfolio management process uses updated cases studies to show investors and financial advisors how an investor's behavior can be modified to improve investment decision-making provides useable methods for creating behaviorally modified investment portfolios, which may help investors to reach their long term financial goals heightens awareness of biases so that financial decisions and resulting economic outcomes are improved offers advice on managing the effects of each bias in order to improve investment results this second edition illustrates investors' behavioral biases in detail and offers financial advisors and their clients practical advice about how to apply the science of behavioral finance to improve overall investment decision making. © 2012 by michael m. pompian. all rights reserved."
"in this chapter, we conduct a comparative study of various traders following different trading strategies. we design an agent-based artificial stock market consisting of two opposing types of traders: ""rational traders"" (or ""fundamentalists"") and ""imitators"" (or ""chartists""). rational traders trade by trying to optimize their short-term income. on the other hand, imitators trade by copying the majority behavior of rational traders. we obtain the wealth distribution for different fractions of rational traders and imitators. when rational traders are in the minority, they can come to dominate imitators in terms of accumulated wealth. on the other hand, when rational traders are in the majority and imitators are in the minority, imitators can come to dominate rational traders in terms of accumulated wealth. we show that survival in a finance market is a kind of minority game in behavioral types, rational traders and imitators. the coexistence of rational traders and imitators in different combinations may explain the market's complex behavior as well as the success or failure of various trading strategies. we also show that successful rational traders are clustered into two groups: in one group traders always buy and their wealth is accumulated in stocks; in the other group they always sell and their wealth is accumulated in cash. however, successful imitators buy and sell coherently and their wealth is accumulated only in cash. © 2011, igi global."

"agent-based stock markets as bottom-up models of financial markets allow us to study the link between individual investor behavior and aggregate market phenomena, and as such are a useful tool for investigating the implications of behavioral finance and investor psychology. in this paper we want to disentangle between the effects of investor sentiment and investor overconfidence. while investor optimism or pessimism influences the expectations of future returns, overconfidence is related to the precision of those expectations and is modeled as miscalibration. in an artificial stock market based on the lls model, we find that more optimistic investors create more pronounced booms and crashes in the market, when compared to the unbiased efficient market believers of the original model. in the case of extreme optimism, the optimistic investors end up dominating the market, while in the case of extreme pessimism, the market reduces to the benchmark model of rational informed investors. the overconfidence of investors is found to exacerbate the effects of investor sentiment. © 2010 - ios press and the authors. all rights reserved."
"impulsive buying behavior has been the subject of a large amount of empirical research, but little research exists that actually examines the significant predictors of impulsive buying behaviors in adolescents. the purpose of this study was to investigate the attitudes of adolescents towards credit and money and the personal financial planning practices they follow, and to examine how these attitudes and practices influenced their impulsive buying behavior. data were collected from 906 adolescent taiwanese college and university students. a logistic regression model was used to identify which students were more likely and which were less likely to make impulsive purchases. the significant predictors were the following 8 variables: gender, age, having taken a course in personal finance, use of money as a reward, family of origin, affective credit attitude, cognitive credit attitude, behavioral credit attitude, and money attitude. © society for personality research (inc.)."
"people appear to be unrealistically optimistic about their future prospects, as reflected by theory and research in the fields of psychology, organizational behavior, behavioral economics, and behavioral finance. many real-world examples (e.g., consumer behavior during economic recessions), however, suggest that people are not always overly optimistic. i suggest that people can be both overly optimistic and pessimistic in their beliefs about future events, depending on whether they focus on success or on failure. more specifically, people judge the likelihood of desirable and undesirable events to be higher than similar neutral events because they misattribute the arousal those events evoke to their greater perceived likelihood. i demonstrated this stake-likelihood effect in 4 studies. in study 1, arousal was shown to increase likelihood judgments. study 2 demonstrated that such elevated likelihood judgments are due to misattribution of the arousal from having a stake in the outcome. study 3 demonstrated that such misattribution of arousal occurs for desirable and undesirable events. study 4 showed the effects of optimism and pessimism on likelihood judgments in a field setting with soccer fans. together, the findings suggest that wishful thinking might be less prevalent than previously believed. pessimism might be as likely as optimism in subjective probabilities. © 2010 american psychological association."
"purpose – the purpose of this paper is to discuss the financial turmoil of 2008 that followed the collapse of the housing bubble in the usa which was the starting point of a global economic crisis. huge costs are borne by every part of society. much wealth has been destroyed. millions of jobs have been lost. the crisis has tarnished faith in free enterprise, in the financial system, and in financial theory. likely, the era of laissez-faire capitalism that started during the reagan-thatcher years is ending. we are entering a period of profound uncertainty. it is imperative that the moral dimension of capitalism be restored. design/methodology/approach – the paper is based on a review of theory and historical evidence relating to financial bubbles and financial regulation. findings – the author offers suggestions on how to rebuild the global financial system. we need: a systemic risk regulator, independent from business and political influence; higher capital requirements for all systemically significant financial service firms; restrictions on proprietary trading in commercial banks; transparency in derivatives; new ways to compensate bankers that reduce the incentive to take excessive risks; consumer protection against defective financial products; and the re-establishment of the principle of fiduciary duty. practical implications – the paper lists practical suggestions on how to reform the global financial system. social implications – economic success is based on trust. after the 2008 crisis, regulatory reform is the best way to rebuild trust in the financial system. originality/value – the paper offers a unique perspective based in part on insights drawn from behavioral finance. © 2010, © emerald group publishing limited."
"as the faith in a rational and efficient market collapses there has been a frantic search to account for the irrational motives underwriting economic behavior. a new popular discourse of economics grounded in behaviorism, models of social contagion, and the sociobiology of affect has emerged. we focus on one particularly influential instantiation of this new discourse, george akerlof and robert schiller's work on animal spirits, which marries behavioral and neuro-economics to keynes' insights on the role of affect on economic fluctuation. animal sprits, we contend, is an attempt to define the parameters of and establish the strategies for the etho-political governance of the economy. to trace the historical emergence of this mode of etho-politics, we examine the contestation over what constitutes reasonable ethical demands on finance capital as they were formulated during the debates surrounding the passage of the 1933 securities act. we conclude that through re-examining this debate about the vulnerability of investors and the limits of the ethical demands this vulnerability warrants, we can recover reasonableness as a critical ideal to contest the terms of etho-politics, so as to alter what economists and policy-makers consider radical and necessary. © 2010 taylor & francis."

"this paper examines the foreign bias in international asset allocation. following extant literature in behavioral finance, we argue that a society's culture and the cultural distance between two markets play an important role in explaining the foreign bias. in particular, we hypothesize that the degree of a nation's uncertainty avoidance affects the foreign bias (more uncertainty-avoiding countries allocate less to foreign markets), as does the degree of a country's individualism (in individualistic countries performance is more directly attributed to a person and less to teams, causing these individuals to be more aggressive in their foreign asset allocations). we further expect that the degree of cultural distance between two countries affects the amount of money allocated to that market. based on extensive robustness analyses, we find support for our hypotheses on the role of culture in international asset allocation. © 2010 elsevier b.v."
"what makes institutions 'real'? one central notion has been emerging recently in sociology, which is 'performativity', a term borrowed from the philosophy of language. i propose a neurolinguistic approach to performativity that is based on john searle's theory of institutions, especially his concept of a 'status function' and his explanation of rule-following as a neurophysiological disposition. positing a status function is a performative act. i proceed in two steps to establish the neurolinguistic framework. first, i apply the concept of 'conceptual blending' borrowed from cognitive science on the status function, and give empirical applications from the research on performativity in financial markets. second, i sketch the underlying neuroscience framework following the neural theory of metaphor, which i illustrate empirically with examples from behavioral finance and neuroeconomics. © 2010 taylor & francis."
"i develop a two market agent-based model to study how global portfolio managers affect global financial crises and stability. first, i create an agent-based model where fund managers make their allocation decisions between two markets and a risk-free asset based on the mean variance framework. simulation results reveal that global managers do not create global financial crises. second, i extend the base model by incorporating insights from behavioral finance where risk is instead determined by fund manager losses. simulation results reveal that slight global manager losses can trigger a widening of both markets' risk premium, accelerating the decline in asset prices worldwide. statistical analysis reveals that global managers are a stabilizing force in smaller numbers; however, they become destabilizing in larger numbers. the ability to reduce risk by diversifying across markets results in excessive risk taking. if global managers exist in larger numbers, systematic over leverage may result such that a deleveraging process can lead to the spreading of financial crises. © 2010 elsevier b.v."
"behavioral finance is a subdiscipline of finance that uses insights from cognitive and social psychology to enrich our knowledge of how investors make their financial decisions. agent-based artificial financial markets are bottom-up models of financial markets that start from the micro level of individual investor behavior and map it into the macro level of aggregate market phenomena. it has been recognized in the literature, yet not fully explored, that such agent-based models are very suitable tool to generate or test various behavioral hypotheses. to pursue this research idea, first we develop a conceptual model of individual investor that consists of a cognitive model of the investor and a description of the investment environment. in the modeling tradition of cognitive science and intelligent systems, the investor is seen as learning, adapting, and evolving entity that perceives the environment, processes information, acts upon it, and updates its internal states. this conceptual model can be used to build stylized representations of (classes of) individual investors, and further studied within the paradigm of agent-based artificial financial markets. © 2010 the institution of engineering and technology."
"this article examines how consumers process graphical financial information to estimate risk. we propose that consumers sample the local maxima and minima of a graph to infer the variation around a trend line, which is used to estimate risk. the local maxima and minima are more extreme the higher the run length of the stocks (the consecutive number of upward or downward movements of a price series with identical mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis). three experiments show that this leads to stocks with higher run lengths being perceived as riskier: the run-length effect. importantly, the run-length effect is greater for investors who are more educated, are employed full time, trade more frequently, have had longer experience trading, and trade a wider range of financial instruments. implications for the communication of financial products, public policy, and consumer welfare are discussed, as are theoretical implications for the processing of visual and financial information and behavioral finance. © 2009 by journal of consumer research, inc."
"purpose – the purpose of this paper is to discuss implications of the global crisis for economic and financial research and policy. design/methodology/approach – the paper reviews many recent studies on the crisis and offers the author's views on some of the most important lessons to be drawn from the crisis findings – the review counters views that the crisis reflected a basic failure of economics, but agrees that it undercuts some particular theories and approaches to economics. more attention needs to be given to imperfections in the operation of both markets and governments, drawing on insights from behavioral and neuro economics and finance and political economy analysis and recognizing the importance of limited information and uncertainty about correct models. the creation of perverse incentive structures explain a large part of the financial excesses that led to the crisis. financial considerations need to be integrated much more closely with macroeconomic analysis and financial risk analysis needs to pay more attention to economic considerations. useful insights can be drawn from many different theories and approaches and we should not expect any one theory to have all the answers. the excesses observed in the advanced economies do not imply that there are not enormous benefits to be gained from further financial liberalization in emerging market economies, but they do show that great care must be taken in establishing strong supervision of such liberalizations and highlight many of the dangers to look out for. originality/value – the paper offers a guide to the literature for those interested in learning more about the causes and effects of the crisis and policy responses and offers a number of suggestions for fruitful research topics and policy strategies. © 2010, emerald group publishing limited"
"fertility clinics and financing companies often offer refund programs in which patients pay a premium up front for fertility treatments. if the treatment fails, clinics refund part of the fee. this is an innovative tool for financing fertility treatments that is virtually unparalleled in other areas of medicine. despite the prevalence of this financing tool, academic commentary has offered little analysis of how it operates, how fertility clinics promote it, and how patients evaluate whether to use it. moreover, academic commentary has not assessed whether current regulations adequately protect patients who use refund programs to finance their treatments. this article offers the first in-depth study of how fertility refund programs are presented to patients. the author conducted an empirical assessment of the website of every united states fertility clinic that is a member of the society for assisted reproductive technology, coding the information presented on these websites about refund programs. the findings are surprising. according to the study, clinics largely fail to comply with professional self-regulations that mandate the disclosure of specific information about their refund program. additionally, clinics often present information about refund programs deceptively or in a manner that exploits poor patient decision-making. using the data in the study and applying insights from behavioral law and economics, the author argues for additional consumer protection regulations for refund programs. refund programs currently operate in a regulatory vacuum, and voluntary self-regulation has failed to promote accurate and effective disclosures. moreover, evidence suggests that patients evaluating refund programs make predictable, systematic mistakes and that clinics offering refunds frame the program in a way that exploits patients' defective reasoning. to protect patients considering refund programs, the author proposes that policymakers require refund providers to make certain mandatory disclosures when presenting information about their refund programs."

"individual investors lose money around earnings announcements, experience poor posttrade returns, exhibit the disposition effect, and make contrarian trades. using simulations and trading records of all individual investors in finland, i find that these trading patterns can be explained in large part by investors' use of limit orders. these patterns arise mechanically because limit orders are price-contingent and suffer from adverse selection. reverse causality from behavioral biases to order choices does not appear to explain my findings. i propose a simple method for measuring a data set's susceptibility to this limit order effect. © 2010 the american finance association."
"deception, a basic and pervasive biological phenomenon, takes many forms, variously referred to as mimicry, trickery, seduction, pretense, feigning, masquerading, impersonation, distraction, or false promises, and these share certain common distinguishing behavioral elements that permit them to be classified into categories. a symbolic language for the codification and analysis of behavioral contingencies shows that all instances of deception are based on a misperception, misprediction, non-perception, or non-prediction by the deceived party, and can be further categorized based on features of the contingencies that define them. instances of particular interest are those in which a deceiving party predicts (and in that sense "" intends"" ) the deception. in those instances, the effect of the deception is usually to the deceiving party's benefit and to the deceived party's detriment.in economics, finance, business, military operations, public affairs, education, and everyday social interaction, deception takes numerous forms. special forms, usually involving obfuscation, concealment, counterfeiting, and misrepresentation, occur in certain prevalent types of property transfer, including securitization, the creation of derivatives, and various types of ponzi schemes. such property transfers tend to be driven by opportunities for deception. they all involve blurring and clouding of the contingencies that defined the transferred properties, thus permitting their obfuscation. © 2010 elsevier b.v."
"despite the increase in institutional ownership, decreased trading costs, and increased real personal savings, we find that the average stock price is lower today than it was in the 1920s. in the aggregate, the propensity to split is a function of recent market performance, personal savings, and the desirability of appearing to be a small firm. our results indicate that, after decades of inflation and the average stock price falling, splitting stocks to return to an “affordable” trading range must be rejected as an explanation. this suggests that other economic forces are behind splits, whether traditional or behavioral in nature. © 2010, the eastern finance association."

"this article advocates a theory of expectation formation that incorporates many of the central motivations of behavioral finance theory while retaining much of the discipline of the rational expectations approach. we provide a framework in which agents, in an asset pricing model, underparameterize their forecasting model in a spirit similar to hong, stein, and yu (2007) and barberis, shleifer, and vishny (1998), except that the parameters of the forecasting model and the choice of predictor are determined jointly in equilibrium. we show that multiple equilibria can exist even if agents choose only models that maximize (risk-adjusted) expected profits. a real-time learning formulation yields endogenous switching between equilibria. we demonstrate that a real-time learning version of the model, calibrated to u.s. stock data, is capable of reproducing regime-switching returns and volatilities, as recently identified by guidolin and timmermann (2007)."
"purpose – the purpose of this paper is to identify common inclusive concepts that might help define the boundaries of a general theory of behavioral finance. design/methodology/approach – a cross disciplinary review of relevant natural and social sciences is conducted to identify common foundational concepts. findings – the overall findings are that a general theory must include assumptions of subjective perception, indeterminacy, and a financial decision process that is both logical and affective. practical implications – optimal financial decisions are not possible and significant market unpredictability will continue because of the dynamic complexity associated with disequilibrium. social implications – the current financial paradigm is based upon radically incorrect assumptions and a general theory of behavioral finance cannot arise from minor corrections to the current financial paradigm. originality/value – this paper is the first to attempt identifying foundational attributes of a behavioral financial paradigm. © 2010, © emerald group publishing limited."
"purpose: the purpose of this paper is to investigate whether, and to what extent, corporate diversification into related and unrelated businesses affects capital structure choices, and whether ownership structure is germane to the understanding of corporate diversification strategies and debt-equity financing choices. design/methodology/approach: univariate approaches include the parametric two-sample t-test, non-parametric kolmogorov-smirnov test and kruskal-wallis rank test, and cluster analysis. multivariate approaches include panel data regressions to identify the sign and magnitude of the effect of diversification on capital structure, after controlling for a number of industry and firm characteristics as suggested in the literature. findings: corporate diversification into related or unrelated industries has opposite effects on capital structure, after controlling for ownership structure and corporate governance mechanisms. consistent with the prediction of organizational economics, an increase in the degree of business relatedness is associated with a reduction in debt while an increase in business unrelatedness is associated with an increase in debt. in addition, there is strong evidence that government-controlled firms use less debt financing and that government ownership weakens the positive relationship between unrelated diversification and leverage. the results are robust to different measures of capital structure. originality/value: traditional finance literature has not been able to provide conclusive evidence on what affects corporate capital structure decisions. this paper shows that a corporate strategy perspective, with its emphasis on a managerial decision-making process, can provide a behavioral basis for understanding capital structure choices. © emerald group publishing limited."
"increased interest in providing business tax cuts to stimulate the economy followed the terrorist attacks of 2001, which heightened concerns about an economic slowdown. among the tax proposals discussed were a corporate rate cut and an investment subsidy. a march 2002 tax cut contained temporary partial expensing for equipment. interest in this issue continued, including proposals by president bush for reductions in taxes on corporations through temporary dividend relief, which were enacted in may 2003. the temporary bonus depreciation expired at the end of 2004. dividend relief was extended through 2010 in legislation passed in 2006. temporary bonus depreciation was also part of a recent fiscal stimulus package adopted in 2008 (p.l. 110-185). some economists doubt the efficacy of fiscal policy in general even when a stimulus is needed, especially in an open economy and given the difficulties of achieving proper timing. also, deficit financing of a tax cut has potential negative long run effects because it crowds out investment; a stimulus designed to increase investment spending (rather than consumption spending) would, if successful, reduce that negative effect. investment subsidies had largely been abandoned as counter-cyclical devices over the last two decades, in part because of lack of evidence from statistical studies relating investment spending to the cost of capital. some recent empirical evidence has found some larger effects, at least with some studies, although not enough to suggest that all of the tax cut is spent (especially with corporate rate reductions). moreover, the average behavioral response identified in these studies may be larger than responses during a downturn when many firms have excess capacities, and planning lags may make investment responses poorly timed. recent studies of the 2002 temporary investment stimulus tended to find it a relatively ineffective stimulus measure. an investment subsidy has more ""bang-for-the-buck"" than a corporate rate cut (or dividend relief), since the latter benefits existing as well as new capital. a corporate rate cut is estimated to produce as little as two-thirds of the investment induced by an investment credit with an equivalent revenue loss. the historically most common investment subsidy is the investment credit, although the same effect could be achieved with accelerated depreciation or partial expensing. a temporary investment credit would be more effective than a permanent one, and a temporary investment credit could also be made incremental. (it is not really possible to structure a permanent incremental credit.) one disadvantage of a permanent investment credit is that it distorts the allocation of investment and can easily produce negative tax rates. a 10% investment credit would produce negative tax rates in excess of 100% for short-lived assets. arguments have been for a corporate tax rate cut because of estimated large effects on the stock market. these calculations are overstated because they do not account for the adjustment process and of interest rate increases. given the uncertainty about the size of stock market effects or their beneficial effect on the economy, there is a case for not considering stock market effects an important factor in choosing an investment subsidy. increased interest in providing business tax cuts to stimulate the economy followed the terrorist attacks of september 11, 2001, which heightened concerns about an economic slowdown. among the tax proposals that were discussed in the 107th congress were a corporate rate cut and an investment credit. an investment credit could be considered on either a temporary or a permanent basis. on october 24, 2001, the house passed h.r. 3090, which included temporary partial expensing (for three years), a provision similar to an investment credit. the bill also contained some other provisions, including a repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax and an extension of net operating loss carrybacks. proposals developed in the senate contained business tax cuts as well. the finance committee chairman's plan included several tax cuts for business: allowing 10% of investments placed in service to be expensed, an increase in expensing dollar limits for small businesses, and some other provisions. the finance republican's plan would provide 30% expensing and repeal the corporate alternative minimum tax, but without refunding accumulated credits immediately as was the case in h.r. 3090. the 10%, one year, expensing provision was included in the version of h.r. 3090 that was approved by the senate finance committee on november 8, 2001. this bill did not pass the senate; however, majority leader daschle proposed a streamlined bill (using h.r. 622 as a vehicle) that would include a 30% one year expensing provision. a final version of h.r. 3090 approved in early march of 2002 included the house expensing provision (two years at 30%). this provision was referred to as bonus depreciation. further action was taken in the 108th congress. at the beginning of 2003, president bush proposed corporate tax relief in the form of an exclusion for dividends and a step up in basis. this proposal provides tax reductions for corporate income to the investors rather than the firm. the effects would probably be similar to corporate rate cuts in the long run, but may have different effects in the short term. in particular, such cuts might be more likely to be translated into spending because they would be received directly by individuals. in h.r. 2, enacted in may 2003, a provision allowing a 15% maximum tax rate on both dividends and capital gains was enacted; the provision expires in 2008. this bill also increased the bonus depreciation rate to 50% and extended it through 2004. bonus depreciation expired at the end of 2004. as the economy recovered, interest in short run stimulus measures diminished. short run stimulus again became a topic of concern in the aftermath of hurricane katrina. dividend relief was extended in legislation passed in 2006, through 2010, although not on the grounds of short-term stimulus. recent problems in the mortgage markets and concerns about the economy have prompted new interest in fiscal stimulus. the stimulus proposal recently adopted (p.l. 110-185) included two major components: an individual income tax rebate and a temporary bonus depreciation similar to that enacted for 2002-2004. this chapter discusses issues associated with the use of business tax subsidies. first, is fiscal policy appropriate? second, how successful are subsidies likely to be and what form might they take to be most effective? finally, what other consequences might flow from the use of business tax subsidies, especially if they are to be permanent? investment subsidies have typically been provided through an investment tax credit. the investment tax credit was originally introduced in 1962 as a permanent subsidy, but it came to be used as a counter-cyclical device. it was temporarily suspended in 1966-1967 (and restored prematurely) as an anti-inflationary measure; it was repealed in 1969, also as an anti-inflationary measure. the credit was reinstated in 1971, temporarily increased in 1975 and made permanent in 1976. after that time, the credit tended to be viewed as a permanent feature of the tax system. at the same time, economists were increasingly writing about the distortions across asset types that arose from an investment credit. the tax reform act of 1986 moved toward a system that was more neutral (within the limits of empirical estimates of depreciation) and repealed the investment tax credit while lowering tax rates. investment subsidies can also be provided through accelerated dep-reciation, but these measures tend not to be used for counter-cyclical purposes. at least one reason for not using accelerated depreciation for temporary, counter-cyclical purposes is because such a revision would add considerable complexity to the tax law if used in a temporary fashion, since different vintages of investment would be treated differently. an investment credit, by contrast, occurs the year the investment is made and, when repealed, only requires firms with carry-overs of unused credits to compute credits. an exception to the problem with accounting complexities associated with accelerated depreciation is partial expensing, that is allowing a fraction of investment to be deducted up front and the remainder to be depreciated. this partial expensing approach also is neutral across all assets it applies to, but the cash flow effects are more concentrated in the present (and revenue is gained in the future). a temporary partial expensing provision, allowing 30% of investments in equipment to be expensed over the next two years, was included in h.r. 3090 in 2002 and expanded to 50% and extended through 2004 in tax legislation enacted in 2003. it expired in 2004. the new stimulus proposal, h.r. 5240 (p.l. 110-185) also included temporary bonus depreciation for 2008. historically, corporate rate changes have tended not to be used for counter-cyclical purposes. the recent interest in the corporate tax rate cuts appears associated with arguments about the effects of tax changes on stock markets. (a similar argument has been made for a capital gains tax cut.) the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax, included in an earlier version of h.r. 3090 in 2001, is similar to a corporate tax rate in some respects, but its effects on marginal investments are uncertain and could possibly discourage investment. © 2010 by nova science publishers, inc. all rights reserved."
"the mean-variance approach is an influential theory of decision under risk proposed by markowitz (markowitz, h. 1952. portfolio selection. j. finance 7(1) 77-91). the mean-variance approach implies violations of first-order stochastic dominance not commonly observed in the data. this paper proposes a new model in the spirit of the classical mean-variance approach without violations of stochastic dominance. the proposed model represents preferences by a functional u(l)-ρ r (l), where u (l) denotes the expected utility of lottery l, ρ σ [-1, 1] is a subjective constant, and r (l) is the mean absolute (utility) semideviation of lottery l. the model comprises a linear trade-off between expected utility and utility dispersion. the model can accommodate several behavioral regularities such as the allais paradox and switching behavior in samuelson's example. © 2010 informs."
"the resource-based view (rbv) presents itself as a more comprehensive theory than the neoclassical theory in order to explain value creation in the capitalist system. rbv emphasizes the role of strategic resources to the company. a theme hardly touched on by rbv is the role played by risk and uncertainly. the theory adopts the standpoint that the stock of strategic resources is important in the determination of the level of profitability of the company. the aim of this work is to present an alternative concept for risk based on the concept of resource. the work is divided into four sections: in the first we present two methodologies to deal with risk in rbv: the perspective of discounted cash flow and the perspective of real options. in the second we present an alternative risk concept (including the means of measuring it), which takes into account the level (sum) of resources essential to the company, as well as the volatility of this level (we will apply the concept including a measure of risk for a sector where the innovative activity is essential). in the third we present a model based on behavioral finance for the behavior of the manager toward risk. finally, the conclusion, in the fourth section. © 2010 mackenzie presbyterian university. all rights reserved."
"procrastination is increasingly becoming a topic of interest across multiple fields, from finance (as people put off dealing with their money troubles) to health (as people delay seeing their doctors). still, there is debate about what exactly procrastination is and how it should be operationalized. the fields of neuroscience and behavioral economics point to procrastination as an irrational delay, where we put off despite being worse off. a competing tripartite model has divided procrastination into avoidance, arousal, and decisional. the validity of the avoidance, arousal and decisional model is reviewed here, first meta-analytically and then factor analytically, using a large sample exceeding 4000 respondents. the evidence does not support the tripartite model, particularly the avoidant and arousal distinction, instead indicating that procrastination is indeed an irrational delay. a new scale consistent with this conceptualization, the pure procrastination scale, is derived from the factor analysis, showing improved correlations with key constructs, such as swb. this new scale provides the field of procrastination with an improved measurement base, likely increasing the usefulness of our future findings. © 2010 elsevier ltd."
"consumers may make inefficient investment decisions in holding their own-company stocks because of several biases documented by the literature of behavioral economics, such as company stock bias, home bias, and mere exposure effect. consumers with high levels of competences may be likely to overcome biases and make effective investment decisions. using data from the 2004 and 2007 surveys of consumer finances, evidence suggests the existence of the biases and competences, whereas a higher level of consumer competence can partially offset the influence of consumer biases. copyright 2010 by the american council on consumer interests."
"summary: key findings in behavioral economics are that people's behavior (revealed preferences) is often not in line with their intentions (normative preferences), that they are sensitive to the way choices are presented to them, and that their cognitive abilities are limited. this is manifest in particular in areas of intertemporal choice, like personal finance and health-related behavior. policy makers can develop policies that help citizens to make choices that are more in line with their normative preferences. in this paper we summarize the behavioral evidence, discuss the motivations for interventions, and show how recent behavioral insights can help to improve upon existing policies. these new policies could be described as libertarian paternalism, and include setting defaults thoughtfully and using unorthodox commitment mechanisms. © 2010 the author(s)."
"implementation science is the scientific study of methods to promote the integration of research findings and evidence-based interventions into health care policy and practice and hence to improve the quality and effectiveness of health services and care. implementation science is distinguished from monitoring and evaluation by its emphasis on the use of the scientific method. the origins of implementation science include operations research, industrial engineering, and management science. today, implementation science encompasses a broader range of methods and skills including decision science and operations research, health systems research, health outcomes research, health and behavioral economics, epidemiology, statistics, organization and management science, finance, policy analysis, anthropology, sociology, and ethics. examples of implementation science research are presented for hiv prevention (prevention of mother-to-child transmission of hiv, male circumcision) and hivand drug use (syringe distribution, treating drug users with antiretroviral therapy and opioid substitution therapy). for implementation science to become an established field in hiv/aids research, there needs to be better coordination between funders of research and funders of program delivery and greater consensus on scientific research approaches and standards of evidence. copyright © 2010 by lippincott williams & wilkins."
"purpose – this paper seeks to explore the ethical implications of creating committed customer relationships. design/methodology/approach – the paper uses an empirical study to test a series of hypotheses concerning the impact of customers' commitment to a brand on their behaviors toward that brand. it then contrasts these behavioral changes with the assumptions of ethical frameworks. findings – customers' behaviors toward a brand change as they become committed to the brand. they shop less, consider fewer brands, and are willing to pay more. these changes violate assumptions of less stringent ethical frameworks. the result is that, as customer commitment increases, the ethical burden on the brand also increases. research limitations/implications – this research is limited by the scope of the sample, automobile finance. future research should explore customer commitment in other product and service categories to determine the extent to which commitment varies. practical implications – the implications of these results are that, when a brand does a great job of satisfying customers and building trust, commitment develops, which increases the ethical burden on the brand. the very brand actions that develop commitment high quality, good service, caring about the customer, must actually increase in importance once strong customer relationships are built. originality/value – the findings in the paper are unique, in that they evaluate a marketing model in terms of ethical impact, rather than simply in terms of increased sales or market share. these findings should be valuable to any brand manager who is focusing on building or managing customer/brand relationships. © 2010, emerald group publishing limited"
"we identify finance professors' opinions on the efficiency of the stock markets in the united states and assess whether their views on efficiency influence their investing behavior. employing a survey distributed to over 4,000 professors, we obtain four main results. first, most professors believe the market is weak to semi-strong efficient. second, twice as many professors passively invest than actively invest. third, our respondents' perceptions regarding market efficiency are almost entirely unrelated to their trading behavior. fourth, the investment objectives of professors are, instead, largely driven by the same behavioral factor as for amateur investors-one's confidence in his own abilities to beat the market, independent of his opinion of market efficiency. © 2009 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved."

"by combining the economic theory of rational expectation bubbles, ( behavioral finance on imitation and herding of investors and traders and the mathematical and statistical physics of bifurcations and phase transitions, the log-periodic power law (lppl) model has been developed as a flexible tool to detect bubbles. the lppl model considers the faster-than-exponential (power law with finite-time singularity) increase in asset prices decorated by accelerating oscillations as the main diagnostic of bubbles. it embodies a positive feedback loop of higher return anticipations competing with negative feedback spirals of crash expectations. we use the lppl model in one of its incarnations to analyze two bubbles and subsequent market crashes in two important indexes in the chinese stock markets between may 2005 and july 2009. both the shanghai stock exchange composite index (us ticker symbol ssec) and shenzhen stock exchange component index (szsc) exhibited such behavior in two distinct time periods: (1) from mid-2005, bursting in october 2007 and (2) from november 2008, bursting in the beginning of august 2009. we successfully predicted time windows for both crashes in advance (sornette, 2007; bastiaensen et al., 2009) with the same methods used to successfully predict the peak in mid-2006 of the us housing bubble (zhou and sornette, 2006b) and the peak in july 2008 of the global oil bubble (sornette et al., 2009). the more recent bubble in the chinese indexes was detected and its end or change of regime was predicted independently by two groups with similar results, showing that the model has been well-documented and can be replicated by industrial practitioners. here we present a more detailed analysis of the individual chinese index predictions and of the methods used to make and test them. we complement the detection of log-periodic behavior with lomb spectral analysis of detrended residuals and (h,q)-derivative of logarithmic indexes for both bubbles. we perform unit-root tests on the residuals from the log-periodic power law model to confirm the ornstein-uhlenbeck property of bounded residuals, in agreement with the consistent model of 'explosive' financial bubbles (lin et al., 2009). © 2010 elsevier b.v."
"we address the question of whether the trading of retail investors causes stock price anomalies. our intent is to study settings in which retail investors are most likely to have influence on market prices. previous research suggests that retail investors have more influence in small capitalization stocks, and argues that retail investors are most likely to be irrational. most theories of stock price anomalies hypothesize the presence of irrational traders. consequently, we focus on stock price anomalies in primarily small capitalization stocks. our data are from the australian stock exchange clearinghouse. the australian stock market is characterized by a high level of direct stock holdings by individual investors, further enhancing the likelihood of retail investors' influence. we investigate the granger causality between investor category trading and stock prices, and display the relative trading volume of the investor categories. we conclude that retail investors are not responsible for stock mispricing. since retail investors do not affect prices in this carefully selected environment, we infer that their trading is unlikely to influence stock market prices. our conclusion has important implications for theories, particularly behavioral finance theories, that are dependent on the influence of retail investor trading in stock markets. © 2010 taylor & francis."
"the problem solving intervention (psi) is a structured, cognitive-behavioral intervention that provides people with problem-solving coping skills to help them face major negative life events and daily challenges. psi has been applied to numerous settings but remains largely unexplored in the hospice setting. the aim of this pilot study was to demonstrate the feasibility of psi targeting informal caregivers of hospice patients. we enrolled hospice caregivers who were receiving outpatient services from two hospice agencies. the intervention included three visits by a research team member. the agenda for each visit was informed by the problem-solving theoretical framework and was customized based on the most pressing problems identified by the caregivers. we enrolled 29 caregivers. patient's pain was the most frequently identified problem. on average, caregivers reported a higher quality of life and lower level of anxiety postintervention than at baseline. an examination of the caregiver reaction assessment showed an increase of positive esteem average and a decrease of the average value of lack of family support, impact on finances, impact on schedules, and on health. after completing the intervention, caregivers reported lower levels of anxiety, improved problem solving skills, and a reduced negative impact of caregiving. furthermore, caregivers reported high levels of satisfaction with the intervention, perceiving it as a platform to articulate their challenges and develop a plan to address them. findings demonstrate the value of problem solving as a psycho-educational intervention in the hospice setting and call for further research in this area. copyright 2010, mary ann liebert, inc."

"recent literature in behavioral finance has contradicted the notion of efficiency of markets. greater emphasis on how psychological biases influence both the behavior of investors and asset prices has led to a strong debate among proponents of behavioral finance and neoclassical finance. this has created the need to study how psychology affects financial decisions in households, markets and organizations. this study conducts a pooled ordinary least squares (ols) model using the fixed effects estimator to investigate the linkage between investor sentiment and stock prices for 35 firms belonging to three different industries over a time period of 56 years, from 1950 to 2005. the findings suggest that investor sentiment does not significantly affect the stock prices in this sample."

"this paper presents models for search behavior and provides experimental evidence that behavioral heterogeneity in search is linked to heterogeneity in individual preferences. observed search behavior is more consistent with a new model that assumes dynamic updating of utility reference points than with models that are based on expected-utility maximization. specifically, reference point updating and loss aversion play a role for more than a third of the population. the findings are of practical relevance as well as of interest for researchers who incorporate behavioral heterogeneity into models of dynamic choice behavior in, for example, consumer economics, labor economics, finance, and decision theory. © 2009 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved."
"this chapter explores some behavioral finance models with evolutionary selection of heterogeneous trading strategies. when strategy selection is driven by short-run realized profits, trend-following strategies may destabilize asset markets. asset price fluctuations are characterized by phases in which fundamentalists dominate and prices are close to fundamentals, suddenly interrupted by possibly long-lasting phases of price bubbles when trend-following strategies dominate the market and prices deviate persistently from fundamentals. even in simple heterogeneous belief models, asset prices are difficult to predict and market timing based on the prediction of the start or the collapse of a bubble is extremely difficult and highly sensitive to noise. simple evolutionary models therefore could provide an explanation. laboratory experiments using human subjects confirm that coordination on simple trend-following strategies may arise in asset markets and cause persistent deviations from fundamentals. in a heterogeneous beliefs asset-pricing model, as long as prices fluctuate around their fundamental values, fundamentalist strategies do quite well in terms of accumulated profits. if there are no limits to arbitrage and fundamentalists can survive possibly long-lasting bubbles during which they suffer large losses, their strategy performs very well in the long run and may help stabilize markets. © 2009 elsevier inc. all rights reserved."
"this chapter provides a methodology to solve dynamic portfolio strategies considering realistic assumptions regarding the return distribution. first, it analyzes the empirical behavior of some equities, suggesting how to approximate a historical return series with a factor model that accounts for most of the variability and proposing a methodology to generate realistic return scenarios. then it examines the profitability of some reward-risk strategies based on a forecasted evolution of the returns. since several studies in behavioral finance have shown that most investors in the market are neither risk averters nor risk lovers, the chapter discusses the use of portfolio strategies based on the maximization of performance measures consistent with these investors' preferences. it first argues the computational complexity of reward-risk portfolio selection problems and then compares the optimal sample paths of the future wealth obtained by performing reward-risk portfolio optimization on simulated data. © 2010 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved."

"this paper provides evidence on the hypothesis that many behavioral finance patterns are so deeply rooted in human behavior that they are difficult to overcome by learning. we test this on a target group which has undoubtedly very strong incentives to learn efficient behavior, i.e. fund managers. we split this group into endorsers and non-endorsers of behavioral finance. endorsers do, indeed, view markets differently as they regard stronger influences from behavioral biases. however, when it comes to the perception of one's own behavior the endorsement of behavioral finance becomes almost meaningless, even though endorsers otherwise do adapt behavior towards their conviction. © 2009 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved."

"finance is in the midst of a paradigm shift, from a neoclassical based framework to a psychologically based framework. behavioral finance is the application of psychology to financial decision making and financial markets. behavioralizing finance is the process of replacing neoclassical assumptions with behavioral counterparts. this monograph surveys the literature in behavioral finance, and identifies both its strengths and weaknesses. in doing so, it identifies possible directions for behavioralizing the frameworks used to study beliefs, preferences, portfolio selection, asset pricing, corporate finance, and financial market regulation. the intent is to provide a structured approach to behavioral finance in respect to underlying psychological concepts, formal framework, testable hypotheses, and empirical findings. a key theme of this monograph is that the future of finance will combine realistic assumptions from behavioral finance and rigorous analysis from neoclassical finance. © 2010 h. shefrin."
"in recent years, the adoption of flat tax by several countries continues to attract considerable attention, both empirical and theoretical part. this paper evaluates the main effects of the implementation of flat tax system in romanian economy. we demonstrate, based on the empirical evidence, that their effects in the economy are ambiguous. if accompanying measures are not going to be enforced, the introduction of the flat rate of 16% in romania will lead to unsustainable budgetary and current account deficits and inflationist pressures. there are no signals of laffer-type behavioral responses consolidating budgetary revenue increases from the tax cut. the flat tax favors the workers with big salaries and big and financially solid companies (which, mainly ""export"" the profit), increasing progressivity and deepening social polarization. it will attack the fragile macroeconomic stability. it is uncertain if it will lead to the increase of the degree of employment, having in view the fact that the contributions to the social insurances have a very high level. the evidence shows that the adoption of flat tax has not resolved the problem of reduction the informal labor market. in the first part of this paper, we conclude that the available data do not to make a relevant distinction between the effects of tax reform and other contextual factors. in the second part, considering that the fiscal policy can play a key role in fostering real convergence, we propose measures to increase the long-term sustainability of public finances in romania, by complying with the stability and growth pact. romania should have chosen to continue what it was confirmed to be a valid element of the economic evolution towards a european standard (progressive fiscal system). on the other side, to optimize the impact of the flat tax reform, we suggest accompanying measures - both fiscal reforms, in particular on the expenditure side, and structural reforms. © 2009 by nova science publishers, inc. all rights reserved."
"most major businesses use business process outsourcing for performing a process or a part of a process including financial services like mortgage processing, loan origination, finance and accounting and transaction processing. call centers are used for the purpose of receiving and transmitting a large volume of requests through outbound and inbound calls to customers on behalf of a business. in this paper we deal specifically with the call centers notes from banks. banks as financial institutions provide loans to non-financial businesses and individuals. their call centers act as the nuclei of their client service operations and log the transactions between the customer and the bank. this crucial conversation or information can be exploited for predicting a customer's behavior which will in turn help these businesses to decide on the next action to be taken. thus the banks save considerable time and effort in tracking delinquent customers to ensure minimum subsequent defaulters. majority of the time the call center notes are very concise and brief and often the notes are misspelled and use many domain specific acronyms. in this paper we introduce a novel domain specific spelling correction algorithm which corrects the misspelled words in the call center logs to meaningful ones. we also discuss a procedure that builds the behavioral history sequences for the customers by categorizing the logs into one of the predefined behavioral states. we then describe a pattern based predictive algorithm that uses temporal behavioral patterns mined from these sequences to predict the customer's next behavioral state. © 2009 springer berlin heidelberg."
"this paper adopts a behavioral finance framework for a discussion about efficiency in developed versus emerging capital markets. we show that the developed austrian capital market appears more efficient than the polish capital market by conducting an event study of earnings announcements of companies listed on these two markets. we show that for the polish market one cannot reject the hypothesis that information about earnings surprises is gradually incorporated into price, while on the austrian market earnings surprises seem not to affect cumulated abnormal returns, which leads to the conclusion that this market is efficient. keywords: market efficiency, capital markets, event study, europe."
"accord to behavioral finance theory, investor's irrational behaviors and psychologies have important influence on stock prices in limited arbitrage stock market. relevant attempts have been made to examine the impact of investor's sentiment on stock prices. but most studies focus on the predictability of investor's sentiment which is measured by direct or indirect index. and all results do not answer whether investor's sentiment is irrational. how dose investor's sentiment influence the stock prices. this paper examines the multi-relationship between investor's sentiment, which is measured by the growth rate of investor accounts, and stock returns by the svar model. the results show that investor's sentiment is influenced by the post performance of stock market, which verifies that investor's sentiment is irrational. and the results also show that investor's sentiment can not predict the future stock returns, but it influences the current stock returns."
"the risk premium is a fundamental and critical component in portfolio management, corporate finance and valuation. given its importance, it is surprising that more attention has not been paid in practical terms to estimation issues. in this paper, we began by looking at the determinants of equity risk premiums including macro economic volatility, investor risk aversion and behavioral components. we then looked at the three basic approaches used to estimate equity risk premiums - the survey approach, where investors or managers are asked to provide estimates of the equity risk premium for the future, the historical return approach, where the premium is based upon how well equities have done in the past and the implied approach, where we use future cash flows or observed bond default spreads to estimate the current equity risk premium. the premiums we estimate can vary widely across approaches, and we considered two questions towards the end of the paper. the first is why the numbers vary across approaches and the second is how to choose the right number to use in analysis. for the latter question, we argued that the choice of a premium will depend upon the forecast period, whether your believe markets are efficient and whether you are required to be market neutral in your analysis. © 2009 new york university salomon center and wiley periodicals, inc."
"we study the valuation impact on 148 insurance stocks caused by 25 of the largest catastrophic events that occurred in recent history. because of their exceptional severity and the consequent high attention they experience in the media we expect to find significant overreactions of insurance stocks relative to the market, which would be in-line with an availability bias known from the behavioral finance literature. however, we have to realize that insurance stock investors behave not less rational than the market does under these conditions. a clear exception to this are the 9/11 terror attacks. in general we find that insurance stocks adjust gradually to a new valuation level. © 2009 the berkeley electronic press."
"twenty professional ballet dancers from korea were interviewed to identity the stressors they experience and the coping strategies they use during practice and performance. inductive content analysis of the data identified four major sources of stress: physical (i.e., physical appearance, poor physical condition), psychological (i.e., desire, slump, personality), interpersonal (i.e., relationship with a dance director, relationship with other dancers), and situational factors (i.e., performance demands, finances). the results demonstrated that, within physical factors, physical appearance (e.g., maintaining a particular body type, keeping low body weight) was a preeminent problem. we also found three general dimensions for coping: psychological strategies (i.e., individual cognitive and emotional strategies, avoidance strategies), behavioral strategies (i.e., dysfunctional behavior, hobby activities, social interaction, dance-related behavior), and physical relaxation. the coping strategies mentioned most frequently were in the behavioral strategies dimension. identifying sources of stress and coping strategies in dance can provide a basis for intervention programs, which can help to reduce stress by developing effective coping skills."
"in recent decades there was a robust boom in investment sector in lithuania, as more people chose to invest money in investment funds rather than keep money in the closet. the baltic states market turnover has increased from 721 meur in 2000 to 978 meur in 2008 (with peak 2603 meur in 2005). when difficult period appeared in global markets, a lot of attention was dedicated towards the managing of investments. investment management firms in lithuania gain significance in personal as well as in business section increasingly; even though these firms are considerably young (the first one in lithuania was established in year 2000). successful investment begins with the financial analysis of stock, asset or index, which you are going to invest. professionals can be divided into two groups as far as this point is concerned: supporters of fundamental analysis and the supporters of technical analysis. fundamental analysts try to determine a company's value by looking at the balance sheet, cash flow statement and income statement. technicians, on the other hand, assume that all these fundamentals are accounted for in the stock's price and analyses charts of price movements and various indicators derived from the price and volume. technical analysis suffered major criticism when fama (1965) presented his efficient-market hypothesis (emh), which states that past prices cannot be used to profitably predict future prices. however, many researches showed that emh is not adequate in many aspects. with this background the ""quantitative behavioral finance"" theory was introduced (see recent works of gunduz caginalp, vernon smith, david porter, don balenovich, vladimira ilieva, ahmet duran, and ray sturm). this theory includes some topics of classical theories, but mainly it is based on behavioral analysis of market agents and helps to understand behavioral biases in conjunction with valuation. this means that there is no reason to criticize the technical analysis, but in difficult cases (e.g. crises) it should be supplemented by behavioral analysis of agents. in this paper some methods of technical analysis are used to create an investment strategy trading in baltic states stock market. the main objectives of this research are: adapt bollinger bands to the baltic market, determine which investment period with - long term or short term - bollinger bands is more efficient, research the efficiency of bollinger bands depending on the parameters. in this paper the optimal parameters are calibrated and the expected profit is estimated without the information about the transaction costs. ""bollinger plotter"" was developed using the most popular mathematical toolbox matlab in order to solve stated problems. application is capable of charting bollinger bands and 6 other technical indicators with desired period of time. this software is not a fully automated decision making system, as decisions are usually made based on value judgment. since the stock returns usually have distributions with fat tails, then less than 95% of data fit in the bollinger trading channels. however the bollinger bands trading signals were supported by additional indicators (e.g. %b), so the loss of data is not significant. our calibration results show that short term investor should apply 10 days moving average and use a trading channel with the width of 1.8 standard deviations, for the bollinger bands."
"this chapter addresses the fundamental aspects of translational research that occur after identification of health problems; discovery of fundamental biological, physiological, and pathophysiological information; and subsequent development and rigorous evaluation of potential interventions. this chapter presents a broad overview of some of the central components of health services and policy research. inherently multidisciplinary, health services research incorporates perspectives, theories, knowledge, and research methods of a broad range of clinical, social, behavioral, and management sciences, including clinical medicine, epidemiology, biostatistics, economics, political science, communication, psychology, public health, operations research, informatics, finance, and management. thus, this study examines health services research through an overview of broad problem areas. translation of medical innovation requires methodological expertise, skill, time, and resources. although difficult, effectively translating advances in scientific knowledge to practice and policy to improve the health of patients and the public requires research of the type discussed in this chapter. the goal of medical care is to improve patient and population health. prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease require integrating knowledge and understanding across the basic, clinical, population, social, and management sciences. health services research is a multidisciplinary scientific endeavor that studies and generates knowledge to facilitate improved translation of medical discoveries into practice to improve the health of patients and the public. © 2009 copyright © 2009 elsevier inc. all rights reserved."

"many great minds, both academics and practitioners, have examined the financial markets in hopes of finding investment strategies that yield the nest results. and nearly all have based their theories on one assumption that investors always act in a manner that maximizes their returns. yet volumes of research show that investors are not always so rational. clearly, not every choice investors make is in their best interest. while emotions like fear and greed play a role in poor decisions, there are other causes of irrational behavior. behavioral finance is the study of how these emotions and mental errors can cause stocks and bonds to be overvalued or undervalued. it has led to the creation of investment strategies that capitalize on this irrational behavior. this chapter has the following objectives: • introduce the application of behavioral finance in constructing investment strategies • describe the typical errors in investors' information processing • describe some of the commonly encountered behavioral biases of investors • explain the limits to arbitrage • reconcile market efficiency and behavioral finance in the chapters that preceded, we presented two broad approaches to security analysis. fundamental analysis involves analysis of financial statements, strengths, and management quality of a firm and its competitors and markets. technical analysis maintains that all information is reflected already in the stock price, so fundamental analysis is a waste of time. technical analysis does not care what the intrinsic value of the stock is. its price predictions are extrapolations from historical price patterns. a third branch called behavioral finance has emerged in the recent years as the third approach to investment analysis. it uses psychology to explain investor behavior that cannot be explained with traditional financial and economic theory. traditional economic theory rests on the sensible assumption that investors make purely rational decisions. a rational decision, as defined by an economist, is one that maximizes an investor's utility function. this simply means that when presented with a choice an investor will always choose the course of action that will gain the most for expending the least. thus, it is a decision supported by logic and reason and is, therefore, deemed ""rational"" by economists. with this assumption made, economists were then free to develop mathematical models that now provide investors with the necessary tools to price assets, optimize portfolios, and quantify and manage risk - all valuable contributions and significant achievements. but was their underlying assumption correct? do investors actually make purely analytical decisions devoid of emotion? studies analyzing historical trades generated by both retail investors as well as professional traders reveal that, in fact, they do not. on the contrary, does this mean the pendulum swings completely the other way and the opposite is then true? do investors make wild, unpredictable, or unexplainable decisions? no, this is not the case either. behavioral finance, by utilizing the insights of psychology, provides the explanation. in the same way that the fields of macroeconomics and microeconomics simply reflect different scales or cosmoses of activity, man, or the individual investor, is a microcosmof the market as a whole. that is, the rationalization, psychology, and investing behavior of an individual investor is directly related to the thinking, feeling, and acting of all investors. the aggregate of all investors is, of course, the market itself. thus, the best guide to how markets function is man himself. indeed, human beings are the sole causal factors of the market. there is nothing in the market that is not a reflection of human behavior. the history of markets can even be seen as a complex set of recurrent human errors. we know the market habitually overreacts or underreacts. behavioral finance provides an alternative explanation to some of the anomalies outlined in the chapter on market efficiency. it takes into account how real (different) people make decisions. some of the irrationalities may arise because investors do not always process information correctly, and, hence, derive incorrect future distributions of returns. this results in arbitrage opportunities. even while knowing the true distribution of returns, investors can make suboptimal decisions. consequently, arbitrage is limited. hence, the absence of arbitrage opportunities does not necessarily imply market efficiency. there are three different and distinct symptoms of the market which correspond to how participants feel (psychologicals), think (fundamentals), and act (technicals). by studying and measuring these three components, experts in behavioral finance arrive at a comprehensive analysis of the market. each of these market functions are always in disequilibria to some degree. these persistent disequilibria result in systemic investing errors. identifying the errors of other market participants, in turn, leads to investment opportunities. exhibit 28.1 presents the link between fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and behavioral finance approaches. some central issues in behavioral finance are why investors and managers (and also lenders and borrowers)make systematic errors. it shows how those errors affect prices and returns (creating market inefficiencies). it shows also what managers of firms or other institutions, as well as other financial players, might do to take advantage of market inefficiencies. © 2009 springer-verlag berlin heidelberg."

"recent advances in the field of behavioral finance have given a fillip to the use of behavioral factors in asset pricing models. this study adds to the understanding of the reit return generating process by exploring the behavioral impact of investor sentiment on reit returns. the results show that when investors are optimistic (pessimistic), reit returns become higher (lower). these findings are robust when conventional control variables are considered. empirical analysis indicates steady erosion in the importance of the default and term structure interest rate variables previously considered as important determinants of reit returns. previous noise trading papers that consider the impact of institutional traders conclude that institutional investors cannot arbitrage away noise trader risk. the results of this paper find an exception in the case of small reits. examination of reits based on size reveals that the return generating process of small reits differs from that of mid-size and large reits. analysis of the return generating process by performance shows high performance reits are more sensitive to the independent variables in the model as compared to the low and mid performance reits. © springer science+business media, llc 2008."
"recent literatures in empirical finance are surveyed in its relation to underlying behavioral principles, principles which come primarily from psychology, sociology and anthropology. behavioral finance encompasses research that drops the traditional assumptions of expected utility maximization with rational investors in efficient markets. herd behavior would be considered one of investors' behaviors that can affect the stock market efficiency. what is the herd behavior and how it comes into? more researchers think the cognitive bias would result in herd behavior. this article contains three parts. the first part - introduction - we provide a brief introduction of herd behavior; the second part - a case study - 1) a small scale experimental questionnaire investigation, only 99 samples, mainly supplies some cognitive bias evidences in stock market. through analyzing of questionnaires we can simply certify that the psychogenic characters, social cognition and anthropological characters maybe result in bounded rationality during stock investment. 2) we notice some special information, and their affection would be enlarged by media, and then stock price would fluctuate abnormally. but we discuss, simply, the relationship between the information and stock price fluctuation, without any positive method. the third part: conclusion part. we list the investigation conclusions and explains the possible reasons - conformity pressure, trade-off difficulty and person cognition, incidence of information, neural simulation - why the endowment effect, sunk cost, house-money effect would effect the person decision and bounded rationality. © 2010 ieee."

"a critical issue in financial markets' research is the debate between the academic orthodox approach of the efficient markets' hypothesis and the critics rising from the behavioral finance paradigm and practice. several alternative explanations have been proposed in order to provide a more realistic description of the financial markets' inner mechanisms. this debate's importance consists in the implications of the adopted point of view on the assessment of the financial markets' predictability degree. [4], [5] proposed a unified approach labeled as adaptive markets hypothesis. thus, from a practical point of view, the main issue consists in providing a pertinent answer to the next question: is an active portfolio management able to provide better results that a passive ""follow the market on long-run"" strategy? if in adaptive models the markets are considered to display, at least in a certain sense, a degree of predictability, then, one of the major difficulties in supplying empirical evidences is the requirement of knowing ex ante the ""exact"" forecast model used by the economic subjects. the aim of this study is providing a solution to this problem inspired by the transduction's (supervised learning) algorithms. our main output consists in the thesis that the forecasting errors matter for price formation in financial markets. so, despite the fact that nor the theoretical foundations nor the empirical evidences are conclusive, we argue that the nature of the ""exact"" learning mechanisms can be seen as one of the key variables in investors' decisions and markets evolution. there is a significant positive payoff of a more detailed study of such mechanisms inside an extended framework of financial markets as complex systems."
"we use a simple, three-item test for cognitive abilities to investigate whether established behavioral biases that play a prominent role in behavioral economics and finance are related to cognitive abilities. we find that higher test scores on the cognitive reflection test of frederick [frederick, s., 2005. cognitive reflection and decision-making. journal of economic perspectives 19, 25-42] indeed are correlated with lower incidences of the conjunction fallacy and conservatism in updating probabilities. test scores are also significantly related to subjects' time and risk preferences. test scores have no influence on the amount of anchoring, although there is evidence of anchoring among all subjects. even if incidences of most biases are lower for people with higher cognitive abilities, they still remain substantial. © 2009 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved."

"ensuring that the poorer segments of the population have access to financial products and services has taken on increased significance as policymakers have come to understand the broad social ramifications of inclusive financial regimes. access not only promotes savings but also enables the poor to manage cash flows and to meet basic needs such as health care, food, and housing. in the united states, the last few decades have seen remarkable progress on that front as low- and moderate-income (lmi) households increasingly use both mainstream products like deposit accounts and ""fringe"" products like payday lending, check-cashing services, and pawnshops (barr, this volume; caskey 1996; hogarth, anguelov, and lee 2004; mann and hawkins 2007). at the same time, because many of those products exploit cognitive and financial constraints, policymakers are now increasingly moving beyond concerns about access to emphasize the need for safety in the design and marketing of financial products (warren 2007). credit cards cut across those concerns. with respect to access, the credit card is a profoundly democratizing instrument. it is only a slight exaggeration to say that any person with a visa or mastercard product can walk into the same stores and restaurants as the most elite trendsetters in our society and purchase the same goods and services, at the same prices. as status in a consumer society shifts to depend more heavily on consumption (rather than family wealth or occupational status), the credit card acts as a leveler of status (cross 2000, 169-84; frank 1999, ch. 4). the credit card also provides a remarkably flexible safety net that can be deployed in response to unexpected financial crises (mann 2006). that protection is particularly important in the united states, where the public safety net is more porous than it is in many peer nations (hacker 2002; howard 2007). at the same time, the credit card is singled out as one of the most perilous consumer financial products. the prevalence of credit card use raises concerns that consumer spending is leading to overindebtedness (schor 1999). in previous work, i present aggregate data that suggest a significant relation between increased credit card use and consumer bankruptcy filings at a national level (mann 2006). the flexibility that makes the credit card so useful for households faced with unexpected difficulties is central to the danger that the product can bring to those who use it in excess (littwin 2008a; mann 2007; mann and hawkins 2007). safety concerns are particularly important in connection with financial products for the poor (mccloud 2007). this chapter uses data from the federal reserve board's survey of consumer finances (scf) for 2004 to examine the penetration of credit cards into lmi markets. the chapter has two purposes. first, i discuss the rise of the modern credit market, emphasizing the segmentation of product lines based on behavioral and financial characteristics of customer groups (for more detail, see mann 2007). among other things, that trend involves the use of products aimed at lmi households that differ significantly from those aimed at middle-class households. second, i describe the use of credit cards by lmi households: the amounts of debt they carry; the types of lmi households that carry debt; and how these households differ from higher-income households that carry debt. despite their lower incomes, lmi households use credit cards almost as often as other households do. indeed, measured as a share of income, the credit card balances that lmi cardholders carry are substantially higher than those of higher-income households. to refine the analysis, the chapter closes with the results of a multivariate regression analysis of the characteristics of lmi households with credit card debt. generally, those results suggest that the demographic characteristics of lmi households that have credit card debt are different in material ways from the characteristics of those households in the overall population with credit card debt. the models i summarize here suggest that age, race, and education correlate with credit card use in the population at large. at least in these models, however, age and race become less important predictors, and education has only a marginal relation to credit card use in lmi households. in lmi households, by contrast, credit card use is most closely related to the use of other financial products: checking accounts, mortgage loans, and car loans. copyright © 2009 by russell sage foundation. all rights reserved."
"the importance of long-term public finance sustainability in the context of current financial crisis is still seen as one of the basic factors of economic stability. demographic development resulting in higher percentage of people in retirement age versus economically active people is one of the main risks. there is a growing pressure on expenditures of age-related systems. for this reason the pension scheme reforms are major issue in advanced countries. while some countries have chosen strictly regulated approach towards pension reform, some have given its citizens a choice whether to stay in the old system, or whether to switch to a new one. such a decision is very complex and whenever the choice was implemented, many more workers switched to a new system than was expected. in our paper, we present a micro-based simulation model for the czech republic that allows us to model the individuals' switching decision using several economic and behavioral factors within an old (payg db) and new (fdc) systems. it allows us to estimate the proportion of people who would opt-out to a funded pillar. our results indicate that under the assumption of rationality and long run predictability of most parameters, only a small fraction of population would choose the multi-pillar scheme. however, this conclusion holds only under a full rationality. once we relax this assumption, a wide range of switching strategies become viable. therefore, the expectations that the switch will be popular cannot be based only on economic factors, but must also incorporate behavioral aspects, such as the risk of aversion."

"in this paper, it is argued that the measurements of an underlying, latent variable cannot straightforwardly be used in group comparisons without testing whether the measurements relate to the latent variable in the same way for all groups. the procedure for testing this is discussed and is illustrated by assessing measurement invariance across groups with a different socio-economic status (ses) for the ortofin, a scale measuring an individuals' orientation toward finances [loix, e., pepermans, r., mentens, c., goedee, m., & jegers, m. (2005). orientation toward finances: development of a measurement scale. the journal of behavioral finance, 6, 192-201]. the results show that one factor of the ortofin, i.e. ''financial information"", is invariant across ses groups while ''personal financial planning"" lacks measurement invariance. implications of these results are discussed. © 2009 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved."
"in recent years, through a great deal of relevant empirical studies, it reveals that the phenomena of under-reaction and over-reaction are increasingly obvious in the real estate market, as the investors' deviation of awareness and the inadequate access to information. in this paper, based on the perspective of behavioral finance, investigation and analysis are carried out to the behavior characteristics of the investors in the property market. the investigation and analysis are based on the three investor mental models which are the bsv model, the dhs model and the hs model. through questionnaires and simulation research methods, the result indicated that, to a certain extent, there exists difference between the real estate investor of our country in the behavior performance and the behavior factors which the bsv model and dhs model have. but it has the good uniformity with the behavior foundation of the hs model. therefore the hs model is, to some extent, suitable to analyze the phenomenon of over-reaction and under-reaction which may exist in china's real estate market. and based on the results of the analysis, put forward some relevant policies and proposals. © 2009 ieee."
"behavioral finance theory has been presented to explain the phenomena not explainable by conventional finance theory based on efficient market hypothesis from the investor psychology. we focused on overconfidence - an important psychological bias -, and analyzed the effect of overconfident investor behavior in stock market using multiagent simulation. we found that, based on the increase in overconfident market investors, market dealing increases and rising trends occur more often. an analysis of the relationship between overconfidence and rising trends shows that rising trends make investors even more overconfident."
"with the sustainable development of china's economy, china's securities market would play more and more important role in the global securities market. however, as an emerging market, the speculative psychology and short-term investing behavior in china's securities market is very obvious, therefore, it is of important theoretical and practical significance to research on behavioral finance features of china's securities market. firstly, the paper introduced the basic characteristics of china's securities market and illuminated the development background of behavioral finance in china; secondly, analyzed the structure and educational level of investors; finally, explained the difference of the investing behaviors between information trader and noise trader. based on the analysis, the paper draw a conclusion that the frequent noise trading and sudden and sharp volatility of stock price of china's securities market was closely related with the perfect degree of market system and the investors, thus, the paper put forward some policy suggestions from the two aspects of macrocosmic supervision of government departments and improvement of investors' educational level. © 2009 ieee."
"this chapter highlights the behavioral and neuroscience work on the prospect theory and the neuroscience of behavioral decision-making. several applications of prospect theory from neuroeconomics to decision analysis to behavioral finance require individual assessment of value and weighting functions. in order to measure the shape of the value and weighting functions exhibited by participants in the laboratory, one must first discuss how these functions can be formally modeled. the field of neuroeconomics is providing a rapidly increasing amount of data regarding the phenomena that lie at the heart of prospect theory, such as framing effects and loss aversion. it is clear that the demonstrations of neural correlates of several of the fundamental behavioral phenomena underlying prospect theory (loss aversion, framing effects, and probability weighting distortions) provide strong evidence to even the most entrenched rational choice theorists that these anomalies are real. the data have also started to provide more direct evidence regarding specific claims of the theory. © 2009 elsevier inc. all rights reserved."
"using 2006-2007 462 company year's m&a sample as well as 231 ceo's related data, we inspected company m&a decisions from the behavioral finance's perspective. we make an empirical analysis on whether excessively self-confident ceos are willing to undertake m&a. using the change of stocks quantity owned by ceo as the measure standard of whether ceos are excessively self-confident or not, we conduct a research on the above question. our empirical analysis results indicate that the m&a wish of excessively self-confident president is high compared to non-overconfident president. but board independence can curb executive overconfidence, the more independent the board is, the more restrained executive overconfidence is, and the positive relationship between executive overconfidence and m&a is more weaker. © 2010 ieee."
"this paper introduces an it artifact called mofin dss that comprises hard- and software components that provide the basis for a prototype of a financial decision support system (dss) to support individual investors reacting to unforeseen market events. we have derived our motivation for building such a system design from behavioral finance research. analyses of the behavior of individual investors provide evidence that this segment does react more significantly to any public news published compared to institutional investors. on the other hand, the analyses show that they react significantly slower than their institutional counterparts. since empirical intraday event study analyses show that capital markets react promptly to new information and that excess returns decrease over a specific period of time, individual investors miss significant trading opportunities due to their current strategies of information research. we address the problem that this market segment is not able to continuously observe diverse information channels and to assess all the new information available. our prototype decision support system continuously observes company announcements and forecasts their potential impact on the corresponding stock price. after identifying those events for which significant market reactions can be expected, wireless push-based message services provide the technical basis for prompt and location-independent information supply. based on a novel simulation-based evaluation methodology we have developed, we demonstrate and quantify the advantages that the developed system provides to the individual investors. © 2009 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved."
"in our study, we tested whether average leverage level of sector and leverage level of sector leader are effective on capital structure decisions of selected firms and sectors listed in ise. we depended on the approach of behavioral finance to this matter as a supplementary approach of traditional finance to capital structure. in respect of its influence on leverage levels of the firms in four sector we addressed for the period of 1999- 2006 (white goods and electronic, banking, cement, paper and packing), while sector averages are effective at a meaningful extent in white goods sector, it was seen that it affects leverage level of sector leader considerably. in the study we carried out by using panel data analysis method, when we consider the firms we addressed as a whole without discrimination in sector-specific terms, however, it was seen that both sector average and sector leader display a positive relation with leverage level of firms with a significance of 10%. © eurojournals publishing, inc. 2009."
"this research focuses on the relationships that students develop with their university after they have graduated. many universities have developed alumni associations with the implicit or explicit aim of generating a source of finance or sources of future commercial and political influence. a longitudinal study measures the emotions associated with specific aspects of students' experience of their university in general and the graduation ceremony in particular. it is hypothesized that emotions are the key drivers that determine students' behavior in their long-lasting relationship with the university. emotions are measured using izard's differential emotions scale (izard, 1971), whereas propensity to develop a relationship is measured over time using attitudinal and behavioral measures. this article presents the first output of a longitudinal study and establishes the validity of measurement scales for the focal constructs. among preliminary results is the finding that emotions generated by attendance at a graduation ceremony are more highly correlated with future behavioral intention than levels of involvement during students' attendance at the university. © 2008 by the haworth press. all rights reserved."
"based on behavioral finance and economics literature, we construct a theoretical framework in which consumers of newly constructed housing units perceive prices to follow a stochastic mean reversion pattern. given this belief and the high carrying cost maintained by real estate developers, potential buyers opt to either exercise immediately or defer the purchase. we simulate the model within a real option framework by which we show that the optimal time to wait before exercising a purchase is positively related to the price level; hence, a negative (positive) correlation between transaction volume and price level (yield) emerges. observing data on housing prices and new construction sales in israel for the years 1998-2007, we apply an adaptive expectation regression model to test consumers' belief in both mean reversion and momentum price patterns. the empirical evidence shows that while consumers' demand pattern is simultaneously consistent with the belief in both momentum and mean reversion processes, the effect of the latter generally dominates. moreover, while the data does not allow for testing the volume and price-level correlation, it does provide support to the positive volume-price yield correlation. © springer science + business media, llc 2009."
"based on the theory of behavioral finance, this paper studies the securities regulation by using the research method of management experiment. it studies the validity of the securities regulation measures, the influence of securities regulation factors and management psychology factors on the investment behavior of investors. it aims at guiding the investors to make rational investment. the paper analyses the experimental results of securities regulation by statistical analysis methods of line graph, bar graph, significant paired t-test and linear regression analysis. the results of the experiment prove that some investors are irrational and verify that there exist some psychological effects phenomena in the investment of the investors in the experiment, such as the phenomenon of self-confidence, self-attribution bias and herding effect. it gets a certain correlativity between the management psychology factors and the securities prices. the paper draws the conclusion that some investors are irrational in the investment and the appropriate measures of securities regulation are effective in the experiment. finally, several suggestions of securities regulation are put forward. © 2008 ieee."

"this chapter describes some of the most important of the many psychological biases or instinctive departures from microeconomic rationality that have been observed (repeatedly) in human financial decision making. it presents only a glimpse of the literature in behavioral finance. behavioral finance is not merely a collection of ""anomalies"" contradicting notions of decision makers as rational but a coherent body of theory, mostly originating in psychology, explaining and predicting the systematic patterns of irrational economic behavior in virtually all human decision making. an aspect of the psychology of collecting that has been alluded to but not properly explained is the potential exploitation of one's own behavioral biases and predispositions so as to aid in the building of a collection. the painful experience of taking a financial loss is a very good teacher. there is a common story that the mistakes made early in a dealer's career are ultimately his making. this underlines the pivotal difference between those dealers and collectors who can accept their mistakes and learn and those who can't and are bound in the end (possibly in the very short term) to give up in a state of either penury or denial. © 2009 elsevier inc. all rights reserved."

"we examine the hypothesis of risk and return in the emerging and transforming market of china. it is a fundamental concept in finance that is important to investors and portfolio managers. previous studies reach no consensus on the risk-return relationship using data from our markets. we investigate risk variables that explain the cross-section of returns in the emerging markets. based on the behavioral portfolio theory, an empirical model is formed. we find a significant complex relationship between risk and return in the market. the results are robust for both monthly and weekly returns. our findings indicate that risk-seeking companies in the emerging stock market of china can also achieve high returns at low risk. © 2008 ieee."
"demographic shifts and behavioral changes are putting increasing pressureon today's public pension systems. a new reality is emerging, characterizedby a high level of uncertainty and a shift of responsibility to the individual.in this context the question arises whether people are assuming thisresponsibility and adopting adequate financial planning behavior (fpb) tosecure their financial situation in retirement.the objective of this study is to investigate individual retirementspecificfinancial planning behavior of the german affluent segment. specifically,this research aims for an improved understanding of individuals'expectations regarding their life and their financial situation in retirement(fp perspectives). furthermore, it explores how people actually carry outfinancial planning for retirement (fp actions) and whether their behaviorcorresponds to recommended principles. the study investigates whetherindividuals show adequate retirement-specific financial planning behaviorand in which areas their behavior demonstrates limitations. based on thesefindings, suggestions to improve individual retirement-specific financialplanning behavior are derived for policy-makers, financial planners andthe individual.this study centers on questions of personal finance, taking into considerationelements from behavioral finance, modern portfolio theory andother research. the empirical validation is based on standardized interviewswith over 500 german affluent individuals, aged 45 to 70 years. theinterviewees were grouped into different investor types, based on similarfundamental characteristics implying comparable financial situations andchallenges in retirement.the results of the study indicate that the german affluent segment ismeeting only some of today's retirement challenges (e.g., they are preparedfor compromises on the expense side, understand diversificationbenefits, and show high risk awareness). however, there are serious limitationsthat need to be addressed, such as a blurred perception of reality, unrealisticfinancial planning, belated start of financial planning, a lack ofrisk mitigation and sub-optimal portfolio choices. differences occur betweeninvestor types: while wealthy and self-employed individuals showan active and more appropriate fpb, investor types with specific risks. (e.g., poor health, limited education) need content-related and motivationalsupport. to improve individual fpb, policy-makers need to provide theappropriate background (e.g., a financial planning standard, mandatory retirementseminars) and the right incentives (e.g., financial planning supportdecreasing over time, confrontation with pension eligibility). financialplanners need to make limitations visible and illustrate possible solutionsby incorporating typical human behaviors in the advisory process and supportingindividuals in risk and asset management. however, it is the individualwho needs to assume his responsibility and change his behavior byimproving his knowledge, conducting conscious financial planning andadapting his vision of retirement flexibly to the respective needs."
"introduction: the first latin american consensus on adhd, held in june 2007, resulted that same year in the publication of a pharmacological treatment algorithm for adult adhd. methylphenidate (mpd) and atomoxetine were identified as first line medications for this age group. following the second latin american consensus on adhd in mendoza, argentina, in october 2008, it was deemed necessary to complement the pharmacological algorithm with psychosocial treatment as part of the latin american algorithms. in the combined and interdisciplinary adhd treatments, stimulant and non-stimulant medications are used after the diagnostic evaluation, and these have proved effective reduction in the main symptoms of adhd (attention deficit, hyperactivity and impulsivity). however, these medications do not alter the dysfunctions of adults suffering from the disorder: poor academic performance, taking longer than the general population to complete professional studies, employment problems such as leaving jobs, dismissals and disciplinary procedures, poor handling of finances, conflicts with partners and family members, poor time management and performance of tasks etc. that lead to frustration, low self-esteem and feeling unable to cope. psychosocial interventions, combined with medications, have proved effective in tackling these dysfunctions. in regard to pharmacological treatment, we reviewed the past five years' research into drug products approved by the usa food and drug administration (fda), stimulants and non-stimulants that have proved effective in reducing the main symptoms of adult adhd, and bupropion/amfebutamone, fulfilling the purpose of this study, namely to summarize the scientific knowledge of adult adhd and to create systematic guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adults suffering from the disorder in latin america. method: a group was formed of six specialists in psychiatry, child and adolescent psychiatry, neurology and clinical psychology from argentina, brazil and mexico all members of the latin american league for adhd research (lilapetdah). a review was carried out of the medline, embase, ovid, cochrane and pub med databases from 2003 to 2008 and a selection was made of english-language research articles on the diagnosis, prevalence, comorbidity, psychosocial impact, pharmacological and psychosocial treatment; in january 2009 tasks were apportioned and the summaries were completed in may 2009. in june 2009, the coordinator and a specialist in the group compiled the information into a final document, mainly using controlled studies, meta-analysis, etc. to propose the pharmacological treatment algorithm and psychosocial interventions for adult adhd in 2009. results: one topic discussed was the prevalence of adhd in adults up until 2005. in order to find an estimate, longitudinal studies were carried out to follow up on children who suffered from the disorder until their adulthood, showing a 3.3-3.5% prevalence rate. some investigators estimated the prevalence of adults with adhd in a general population sample of the usa and reported a rate of 4.4%. in this sample, most cases went untreated and the only treatment received was for the comorbid psychiatric disorders including substance abuse. a recent metaanlasis over 100 publications from every continent, reported the combined adhd rate of 5.29%. variations between countries were mainly due to methodological reasons. the study of ten national surveys in europe, latin america, the middle east and the usa to investigate the prevalence of mental disorders, including adult adhd, showed a global prevalence of adhd of 3.4%, the highest rates being reported in france 7.3%, usa and netherland 5% and the lowest being in mexico and colombia 1.9% and spain 1.2%. these results on low levels of prevalence among adults are more related to bias in diagnostic criteria than actual reality. there are many limitations to the use of dsm iv criteria for the clinical diagnosis of adults, as the criteria were designed for children. the three symptoms (attention deficit, hyperactivity and impulsivity) manifest themselves differently with adults, as the criteria are not sensitive enough to detect manifestations shown in this age group. furthermore, impulsivity in adulthood is considered as a key feature of this disorder that leads to serious behavioral and cognitive manifestations, which the dsm only evaluates with three criteria. other investigators had discussed at what age adhd begins, and suggests the existence of the late onset of adhd among adult sufferers shows that it is not essential to consider it starting before the age of 7. this study indicates that the many difficulties facing adults when recalling their infancy and forgetting information must be taken into account when making the diagnosis and it therefore recommends using information from third parties to support the retroactive diagnosis. clinimetric instruments are now available in spanish to assist in clinical evaluation, such as the world health organization's (who) asrs.v.1 and asrs.1.1 and the fasct in mexico with a selfadministered version and another one for the informant that uses screening tools. the spanish-language version of the structured international neuropsychiatric interview (mini plus) for the diagnosis, which explores principle psychiatric disorders, has a section on adult adhd. the presence of comorbid disorders is very frequent and this makes it difficult to diagnose adhd, given that other cognitive, social and work-related dysfunctions share the same symptoms. studies show that 35 to 50% of depressive episodes throughout their lives. 40 to 60% of patients with the disorder manifest one or more of the diagnoses in the anxiety spectrum during their lives. 15.2% of adults suffering from adhd have abused drugs, mainly alcohol and tobacco. substance abuse complicates the diagnosis among adults, though it is important to point out that patients receiving pharmacological treatment with stimulants do not appear to face an increased risk of substances use disorders. comorbidities and other pathologies shown by adults with adhd must be diagnosed and treated promptly and independently of the specific and integral treatment of adhd. adults suffering from the disorder have the following symptoms: having difficulty in coping with waiting, making impulsive decisions, being easily distracted by irrelevant thoughts, having trouble remembering things and staying alert and awake in boring situations, not remembering as many childhood events compared with non-sufferers. the psychosocial impact is reflected in academic, vocational and work-related instability, conflictive relationships with partners, problems raising children and social lives. in regard to pharmacological treatment, there is a description of results of controlled studies, meta-analysis and in some cases open studies on drug products approved by the usa fda, stimulants and non-stimulants that are effective in addressing the main adult adhd symptoms and the bupropion/amfebutamone dopamine reuptake inhibitor. psychosocial interventions for adults with adhd include psychoeducation, cognitive behavioral therapy, individual and group therapy, neurocognitive strategies and social skills training. studies show positive changes in behavior and attitude for those suffering from the disorder. the decision tree had three stages: stage 0 - focus on clinical assessment, diagnosis and psychoeducation. psychoeducation involves understanding the clinical condition, and provides very precise explanations about the combined treatment and pharmacological prescriptions. there is no scientific evidence for the combination and escalation of pharmacological an psychosocial interventions, these recommendations were obtained by consensus of the authors. stage 1 - recommend using extend release or immediate release mpd, atomoxetine or amphetamines (in countries where available). for partial responses, proceed to stage1a. stage 1a - extended psychoeducation is combined with medication and cognitive strategies and social abilities. for partial responses proceed to stage 2. stage 2 recommends a change in medication, if treatment had begun with short-acting mph, change to long-acting mph. if treatment began with the latter, change to the immediate release. if treatment began with amphetamines, change to immediate release or extended release mph or atomexetine. for partial response proceed to stage 2a. in stage 2a, combine medications with a psychoeducational refresher, review previous interventions, and behavior cognitive program. for partial responses processed to stage 3. stages 3 recommends bupropion/amfebutamone, assess the response 4 weeks later, adjust the dose and observe continued response. conclusions: the adult adhd treatment algorithm is the result of a study by a latin american group of mental health specialists, recommends a combined treatment using stimulant and non-stimulant drug products and psychosocial interventions."
"the idea of information and communication technology(ict) being a ""hammer"" that can be applied to a wide variety of ""nails"" across different geographic locations, sectors, organizations, and contexts to improve efficiency and/or have a beneficial social impact has come under severe criticism, particularly in the realm of implementing socioeconomic development programs. structuration theory remains one of the key metatheories that deconstruct the complexity of technology introductions in the context of organizational and behavioral change. in this study, we use a structurational lens to examine two pilot ict implementations in the indian microfinance sector, specifically exploring the interactions between the ict intervention, the organizations and people implementing the change, and the structural and institutional context within which these projects were rolled out. we showcase how an ""ict for development"" intervention is inherently a political process, involving choices around defining efficiency and targeting particular social welfare improvements, with varying repercussions for the involved microfinance institution and client. where the client's context, constraints, and welfare are placed at the heart of the ""efficiency"" discussion during the technology's design and implementation, the development impact is seen to be far greater and more sustained. © 2009 wiley periodicals, inc."
"policymaking for posterity involves current decisions with distant consequences. contrary to conventional prescriptions, we conclude that the greater wealth of future generations may strengthen the case for preserving environmental amenities; lower discount rates should be applied to the far future, and special effort should be made to avoid actions that impose costs on future generations. posterity brings great uncertainties. even massive losses, such as human extinction, however, do not merit infinite negative utility. given learning, greater uncertainties about damages could increase or decrease the optimal level of current mitigation activities. policies for posterity should anticipate effects on: alternative investments, both public and private; the actions of other nations; and the behaviors of future generations. such effects may surprise. this analysis blends traditional public finance and behavioral economics with a number of hypothetical choice problems. © springer science + business media, llc 2008."
"human beings are critical to the functioning of the vast majority of operating systems, influencing both the way these systems work and how they perform. yet most formal analytical models of operations assume that the people who participate in operating systems are fully rational or at least can be induced to behave rationally. many other disciplines, including economics, finance, and marketing, have successfully incorporated departures from this rationality assumption into their models and theories. in this paper, we argue that operations management scholars should do the same. we explore the theoretical and practical implications of incorporating behavioral and cognitive factors into models of operations management and suggest fruitful avenues for research in behavioral operations. ©2008 informs."
"we consider the limit s to traditional finance in evaluating power projects and investigate the role biases and heuristics used by individuals and institutions play in investment decisions, particularly those affecting less familiar, lower-carbon electricity generation. traditional finance relies on the principles and results of modern portfolio theory, such as the efficient market hypothesis, which tends to describe investment results in terms of mean percentage return, statistical risk (e.g. standard deviation), and reward-torisk ratios. for power projects, firms consider various financial criteria for comparing projects opportunities with unequal lifetimes. to forecast financial criteria for project opportunities, firms will n ormally project the cash flow profile, often using monte carlo simulations given the volatility of some point estimations. in addition, real options analysis can be integrated if the relevant option (abandonment, expansion, flexibility) value may be significant. many potential risks already incorporat ed in the traditional finance prospective include: business and commercial risk, country (or political risk), exchange rate and interest rate risk, inflation and liquidity risk. rather than assuming all investors are rational and all relevant facts will be interpreted correctly, institutional behavioral finance assumes firms make decisions according to their own objectives and constraints. project decisions are affected by both the institutional framework and individual behavior. behavioral characteristi cs can affect decision-making by contributing to biased forecasts, especially in those institutions or projects for which decision-making power is highly concentrated. specific biases affecting power projects include: representativeness, overconfidence, anchoring-and-adjustment, aversion to ambiguity, endorsement effect, and loss aversion. project decision -makers may not fully incorporate financial projections, as rather than researching or trusting that information they are forming own rules developed through experiments, making investment decision that is most prominent, and relying on heuristics. we analyze the risks and opportunities for shareholders, creditors, and equipment vendors in moving from the traditional to the behavioral model, with a speci al emphasis on 'newer' investment decisions found in lower-carbon generation such as renewable or advanced coal and ccs technologies. © 2009 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved."

"the use of standard preferences for asset pricing has not been very successful in matching asset price characteristics, such as the risk-free interest rate, equity premium and the sharpe ratio, to time series data. behavioral finance has recently proposed more realistic preferences such as those with loss aversion. research is starting to explore the implications of behaviorally founded preferences for asset price characteristics. encouraged by some studies of benartzi and thaler [1995. myopic loss aversion and the equity premium puzzle. the quarterly journal of economics 110 (1), 73-92] and barberis et al. [2001. prospect theory and asset prices. quarterly journal of economics cxvi (1), 1-53] we study asset pricing with loss aversion in a production economy. here, we employ a stochastic growth model and use a stochastic version of a dynamic programming method with an adaptive grid scheme to compute the above mentioned asset price characteristics of a model with loss aversion in preferences. as our results show using loss aversion we get considerably better results than one usually obtains from pure consumption-based asset pricing models including the habit formation variant. © 2008."

"when modeling valuation under uncertainty, economists generally prefer expected utility because it has an axiomatic foundation, meaning that the resulting choices will satisfy a number of rationality requirements. in expected utility theory, values are computed by multiplying probabilities of each possible state of nature by the payoff in that state and summing the results. the drawback of this approach is that all state probabilities need to be dealt with separately, which becomes extremely cumbersome when it comes to learning. finance academics and professionals, however, prefer to value risky prospects in terms of a trade-off between expected reward and risk, where the latter is usually measured in terms of reward variance. this mean-variance approach is fast and simple and greatly facilitates learning, but it impedes assigning values to new gambles on the basis of those of known ones. to date, it is unclear whether the human brain computes values in accordance with expected utility theory or with mean-variance analysis. in this article, we discuss the theoretical and empirical arguments that favor one or the other theory. we also propose a new experimental paradigm that could determine whether the human brain follows the expected utility or the mean-variance approach. behavioral results of implementation of the paradigm are discussed. copyright 2008 psychonomic society, inc."

"purpose – the purpose of this paper is to examine the informative power of rating agencies in the process of establishing sovereign risk, over a ten-year period (1997-2006). design/methodology/approach – first, following an earlier model, the concept of noise-rater risk is introduced. second, four panels were carried out to identify the most significant macro factors in determination of sovereign ratings, taking into account contemporaneous and lagged variables. the dependent variable is sovereign rating issued at the end of each year. third, three kinds of errors committed by rating agencies when altering the sovereign ratings of emerging countries are defined. findings – noise-rater risk amplifies the chances of noise traders obtaining higher returns than arbitrators. the panels show that, with the exception of debt, all other factors are sample dependant, and that variables and samples leave ample space for subjective factors. analysis of errors demonstrates that rating agencies appear to lose their focus/modus operandi/principles in times of crisis, and that they commit more errors immediately prior and after the onset of a financial crisis. practical implications – the paper argues for a cautious analysis of rating agency's informative power. like any other stakeholder, rating agencies are influenced by cognitive limitations, erroneous beliefs, and the cost of acquiring and using information. originality/value – the paper uses behavioral finance methodologies to observe rating agencies and demonstrates, from its observations of sovereign ratings, that agencies tend to fail at times of financial turmoil, i.e. when they are most needed, by abandoning their “look at the future” principle. © 2009, © emerald group publishing limited."
"lehavy and sloan (2008, review of accounting studies) note that prior studies find that earnings and cash flows explain only a small portion of the cross-sectional variation in stock return. this motivates them to investigate empirically the ability of a behavioral model of capital market equilibrium proposed by merton (1987, journal of finance, 42, 483-510) to explain the remaining variation in stock returns. their primary findings show that security value is, as predicted, increasing in investor recognition of the security and that investor recognition is incremental to and more important than cash flows in explaining the cross-sectional variation of stock returns. while the research question is intriguing and well motivated, a number of methodological limitations may limit the reliability of the findings/interpretations. in this paper, i first evaluate the motivation and potential contribution of the lehavy and sloan (2008) study. i then outline methodological limitations underlying the study and offer ways of overcoming them. in the final section, i state my conclusions. © 2008 springer science+business media, llc."
"fluctuations in the stock market and in house values over the course of recent years have led to renewed macroeconomic policy debate as regards the effects of financial and housing wealth in the determination of consumer spending. this research assembles a unique matched sample of household data from the survey of consumer finance and the consumer expenditure survey to estimate the consumption effects of financial and housing wealth. the micro-data permit numerous innovations in the assessment of wealth effects, including an analysis of the impact of wealth on both durable and non-durable consumption and a comparison of wealth effects as derive from gross versus after-debt measures of financial and housing wealth. further, the research seeks to assess robustness of those estimates to deviations from trend and volatility in financial and housing wealth and among credit constrained and non-credit constrained households. overall, research findings indicate relatively large housing wealth effects. among homeowners, the housing wealth elasticities are estimated in the range of .06 over the 1989-2001 period. in marked contrast, the estimated elasticities of consumption spending with respect to financial wealth are smaller in magnitude and are in the range of .02. further, the estimated wealth elasticities appear robust to deviations from trend and volatility in the wealth measures. research findings support the hypothesized behavioral distinction in household consumption spending across durable versus non-durable categories. consumption propensities also diverge sharply across the credit constrained and non-credit constrained households. finally, there is little difference in wealth elasticities derived from measures of home equity versus house values. research findings suggest the possibility of sizable reverse wealth effects. for example, a 10 percent decline in housing wealth from 2005 levels translates into a 1 percentage point decline in real gdp growth, a sizable reduction relative to the approximate 4 percent real gdp growth evidenced in prior years. results of the analysis point to the sizable economy-wide risks associated with the recent retrenchment in house values. © 2008 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved."

"purpose - this paper seeks to investigate the role of income-inequality on the size of local government. design/methodology/approach - first, the paper extends the model proposed by meltzer and richard, allowing for spatial interaction in the redistributive in-kind transfers from the local governments. second, it estimates the determinants of the size in local government taking into consideration spatial dependence in the variables. findings - this model points that the poorer the median voter is, the higher should be the level of local public expenditures, but the spillover effect (spatial effect) in spending is undetermined. second, using data on brazilian states public finance, the results suggest a negative relation between expenditures (and tax revenues) and the median voter income, in favor to the model. while both public spending and tax rates exhibit negative spatial correlation (substitute goods), behavioral significance can be attached to the spatial process in public spending but not to the spatial process in the local tax rate. originality/value - the paper provides a small extension of the meltzer and richard model allowing for spatial interaction and contributes to the empirical debate about inequality and the size of the government presenting the results for brazil. © emerald group publishing limited."
"neoclassical financeprovides a concise and powerful account of the underlying principles of modern finance, drawing on a generation of theoretical and empirical advances in the field. stephen ross developed the no arbitrage principle, tying asset pricing to the simple proposition that there are no free lunches in financial markets, and jointly with john cox he developed the related concept of risk-neutral pricing. in this book ross makes a strong case that these concepts are the fundamental pillars of modern finance and, in particular, of market efficiency. in an efficient market prices reflect the information possessed by the market and, as a consequence, trading schemes using commonly available information to beat the market are doomed to fail. by stark contrast, the currently popular stance offered by behavioral finance, fueled by a number of apparent anomalies in the financial markets, regards market prices as subject to the psychological whims of investors. but without any appeal to psychology, ross shows that neoclassical theory provides a simple and rich explanation that resolves many of the anomalies on which behavioral finance has been fixated. based on the inaugural princeton lectures in finance, sponsored by the bendheim center for finance of princeton university, this elegant book represents a major contribution to the ongoing debate on market efficiency, and serves as a useful primer on the fundamentals of finance for both scholars and practitioners. © 2005 by princeton university press. all rights reserved."
"we examine the short-term dynamic relation between the s&p 500 (nasdaq 100) index return and changes in implied volatility at both the daily and intraday level. neither the leverage hypothesis nor the volatility feedback hypothesis adequately explains the results. alternatively, we propose that the behavior of traders (from the representativeness, affect, and extrapolation bias concepts of behavioral finance) is consistent with our empirical results of a strong daily and intraday negative return-implied volatility relation. moreover, both the presence and magnitude of the negative relation and the asymmetry between return and implied volatility are most closely associated with extreme changes in the index returns. we also show that the strength of the relation is consistent with the implied volatility skew. © 2008 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved."
"recent advances in the field of neuroeconomics and behavioral finance have shed new light on the biological correlates of human economic and financial behavior. in this context, a reduced serotonergic activity has been consistently linked to an increased rate of rejection of unfair offers in the ultimatum game (ug), a simple two-person bargaining between a proposer and a responder. besides serotonin, increased testosterone levels have been associated to rejections of unfair ug offers, as well as to higher financial gains among professional traders operating in the london stock market. since low serotonin and high testosterone levels in the central nervous system may interact to exert significant effects on the neural mechanisms involved in the expression of impulsivity and aggressive behavior, it is feasible to hypothesize that serotonergic neurotransmission might exert an important influence on investors' choices in real-world financial markets. future studies in this area should explore whether tryptophan depletion may actually improve (or diminish) investors' trading performance. © 2008 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved."
"this chapter addresses the fundamental aspects of translational research that occur after identification of health problems; discovery of fundamental biological, physiological, and pathophysiological information; and subsequent development and rigorous evaluation of potential interventions. this chapter presents a broad overview of some of the central components of health services and policy research. inherently multidisciplinary, health services research incorporates perspectives, theories, knowledge, and research methods of a broad range of clinical, social, behavioral, and management sciences, including clinical medicine, epidemiology, biostatistics, economics, political science, communication, psychology, public health, operations research, informatics, finance, and management. thus, this study examines health services research through an overview of broad problem areas. translation of medical innovation requires methodological expertise, skill, time, and resources. although difficult, effectively translating advances in scientific knowledge to practice and policy to improve the health of patients and the public requires research of the type discussed in this chapter. the goal of medical care is to improve patient and population health. prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease require integrating knowledge and understanding across the basic, clinical, population, social, and management sciences. health services research is a multidisciplinary scientific endeavor that studies and generates knowledge to facilitate improved translation of medical discoveries into practice to improve the health of patients and the public. © 2009 elsevier inc. all rights reserved."
"this paper extends the theory of corporate international investment in choi (j. int. bus. stud. 20: 145-155, 1989) in an environment where the segmentation of international capital markets for investors or the presence of agency costs provide some independence to corporate decisions. the model shows that the real exchange risk, the competition between firms in different markets and diversification gains affect corporate international investment. by accounting for the role of information as defined in the models of merton (j. finance 42: 483-510, 1987), bellalah (int. j. finance econ. 6: 59-67, 2001a) and bellalah and wu (int. j. theor. appl. finance 5(5): 479-495, 2002), the model embodies different existing explanations based on economic and behavioral variables. we show in a ""two-country"" firm model that real exchange risk, diversification motives and information costs are important elements in the determination of corporate international investment decisions. the dynamic portfolio model reflects the main results in several theories of foreign direct investment. our model accounts for the role of information in explaining foreign investments. it provides simple explanations which are useful in explaining the home bias puzzle in international finance. using the dynamical programming principle method, we provide the general solution for the proportion of firm's total capital budget. we also use a new method to get explicit solutions in some special cases. this new method can be applied to solve other financial control problems. the simulating results are given to show our conclusion and the influence of some parameters to the optimal solution. the economic results can be seen as a generalization of the model in solnik (j. econ. theory 8: 500-524, 1974). © 2008 springer science+business media, llc."
"internet stocks registered large gains in the late 1990s, followed by large losses from early 2000. using stochastic dominance theory, we infer how investor risk preferences have changed over this cycle, and relate our findings to utility theory and behavioral finance. our major findings are as follows. first, risk averters and risk seekers show a distinct difference in preference for internet versus ""old economy"" stocks. this difference is most evident during the bull market period (1998-2000) where internet stocks stochastically dominate old economy stocks for risk seekers but not risk averters. in the bear market, risk averters show an increased preference for old economy stocks, while risk seekers show a reduced preference for internet stocks. these results are inconsistent with prospect theory and indicate that investors exhibit reverse s-shaped utility functions. © 2008 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved."

"based on the study of irrational managers in behavioral corporate finance, this paper proposes a financing decision-making model by the construction of investors' rationality and analysis to managers' risk-aversion. measuring managerial risk aversion under behavioral corporate finance paradigm according to risk aversion index, this paper analyzes the financing behavior of risk-averse managers by means of analyzing dj-china 88 index from 2000 to 2004 through logistic regression and mean analysis. the findings show that if other variables are well-controlled, then the risk-averse index has an obvious negative influence on debt financing decision. the higher is the level of risk-aversion, the less is the likelihood of application of debt financing, which means risk-averse managers prefer stock financing. © 2008 ieee."

"ellsberg paradox and allais paradox indicate that not all the informationmeasures are additive and can be separated from preferences. behavioral finance points out that beliefs of people are heterogeneous. in this paper, information therefore is described through non-additive measures, and aggregated with choquet expectation in asset pricing. considering the heterogeneity of people, we introduce a random parameter λ to represent the diversity of people's preferences and information processing methods. we then aggregate these heterogeneous beliefs by ordinary additive integral. in this way a new pricing method for european options is proposed. simulation further proves that this method has advantages over traditional blackscholes method in interpreting some puzzles. this paper finally lays the foundation for empirical research that applies bayesian updating from real market data. © 2008 ieee."

"given the increased competitive pressures to invest in integrated systems for accounting and financial management, the ability to successfully implement these types of systems is probably of greater importance today than at any other time. however, as these systems have evolved as an institutional core within organisations, a recurring and often corresponding problem is failed implementation associated with poor management of the change process. much of the existing academic literature focuses in detail upon technical aspects, with relatively little work examining social aspects. the work presented in this paper differs in that the focus is upon the behavioral aspects of the implementation process, specifically upon the perceptions of the system users and the managers of the implementation process. the paper presents the latest results from a study employing the case study approach in investigating an implementation of an enterprise system that integrates the accounting and finance functions within the education sector in the uk. the results highlight six main areas that appear to cause particular concern; training, user management, communication, project championing, planning, and system administration."
"this paper examines whether the accrual anomaly exists in korean stock markets as in the u.s., and tests whether the accrual anomaly is associated with a potential risk factor that can be included in a rational asset pricing model. accruals are commonly measured by the difference between accounting earnings and operating cash flows, and have been considered the most important accounting variable for measuring the degree of earnings management and earnings quality in the literature. for example, sloan (1996) studied the stock market responses on the operating accruals produced largely by managers' discretion and found the strong tendency of firms with high operating accruals to earn lower stock returns on average than those with low operating accruals. since then, many studies report evidence that such an accrual anomaly is a common phenomenon existing in other stock markets, too. there are two explanations for the possible sources of the accrual anomaly. the first one is a risk factor hypothesis based on the market efficiency, which predicts that the accrual anomaly arises from the compensation for a potential risk factor that is not included in the existing asset pricing models. in contrast, the second explanation is a mispricing hypothesis based on the behavioral finance, which says that the accrual anomaly arises from the stock market inefficiency and investors' overreaction, i.e., investors are too optimistic about firms with high accruals and too pessimistic about firms with low accruals. empirical results of this paper confirm the presence of the accrual anomaly in korea over the period from 1987 to 2005, irrespective of the alternative accrual measures used. we find that stocks for firms with low accruals outperform significantly those with high accruals by about 16% p.a. over the next three years when the total accrual measure is used, and by about 10% p.a. over the next 1 year when the net operating asset measure is used. this result contrasts to that of hiershleifer, et al. (2004), who show that the net operating asset measure in the u.s. is more effective in producing larger abnormal returns than the total accrual measure. in order to test whether the accrual anomaly can be regarded as a risk factor, we follow the standard approach of fama and french (1993) and daniel and titman (1997), and construct an accrual-based factor-mimicking portfolio, almh (accrual low minus high). the almh factor has a sharpe ratio of 0.08, which is similar to that of the hml factor of fama and french (1993) but higher than that of the market factor, and thus, can provide an additional diversification effect when a tangent portfolio is formed with other factors. in a time series regression test, both fama-french 3-factor model and 4-factor model with this almh factor included fail to explain sufficiently the average stock returns on various test asset portfolios based on size and accruals. in addition, after controlling for firm characteristics such as firm size and accruals, the almh factor loading does not show any positive relation with stock returns, which suggests a rejection of the risk factor hypothesis. this result is also supported by the cross-sectional test at an individual stock level, where individual stock returns are explained significantly by the accrual characteristic, but not by the almh factor loading. in sum, all of the test results consistently indicate that the accrual anomaly is more likely to arise from a mispricing of accruals of individual firms rather than from a potential risk factor, which is consistent with the behavioral explanation based on market inefficiency."
"various rational and behavioral models have been proposed to explain contrarian portfolio returns. in this article, i test the gradual information diffusion model of hong and stein [hong, h., & stein j. c.

"to validate the existence of abnormal returns, the most of empirical studies use the event study methodology which examines the behavior of firms' stock prices around corporate event. however, this methodology was been the source of several limits. some defenders of efficiency theory assert that the abnormal returns are due to the event study methodology failures and econometric problems. however, partisans of behavioral finance demonstrate that the abnormal returns are due to psychological bias. the main purpose of this paper is to verify if the abnormal returns resulting from the event study methodology are due to econometric problems or to psychological bias generated by irrational investors' reactions. for the econometric bias, five problems are studied: the choice of market index; the missing observations; the abnormal returns normality, joined hypothesis; and the variance volatility in the event window. results show that abnormal returns are far from being due to the event study methodology failures and econometric bias. for the psychological problems, based on trading volumes, the results show negative and significant abnormal returns (investors' under-reaction); a strong positive correlation between abnormal returns and abnormal trading volumes and a significant causal sense between them. so, abnormal returns are due to psychological bias."

"recent research has found that men trade stocks more frequently than women and receive a lower price as a result. the behavioral finance literature attributes this greater trading activity to men's overconfidence. women's lack of overconfidence and past agricultural economics research suggest the possibility that women may be better at marketing grain than men. this article uses actual transactions of farmers marketing wheat and also finds that men trade more often than women. women also sell two weeks later in the marketing year. there is no direct effect of gender on price received, but by storing longer women receive 1.4 cents/bushel less than men, on average. in contrast to the arguments in previous research, we argue that men's greater number of trades can be better explained by men enjoying trading rather than by overconfidence. © 2008 international association of agricultural economists."
"this paper is an empirical extension aimed at investigating the relationships between the indicators of the financial superstructure and its intermediation environments; and especially how the former responds to the effects of the latter. intermediation-environmental models patterned after multivariate regression, causality, and partial adjustment models of both linear and log-linear formulations were estimated and analyzed. the results reveal that three environments: socio-political, regulatory, and international finance-exerted significant effects on the intermediation function of the superstructure. previous intermediation successes ginger up current performance. in the long run, the effects of the environmental factors on the intermediation function of the superstructure, in whatever direction, more than quadruples. in any given year, the nigerian financial superstructure attains only about 21.9% of desired (optimal) fir. given this, it would take about 4-1/2 years for it to adjust its intermediation operations (fir), in light of the effects of environmental factors, to optimal levels in order to significantly impact the economy as desired. some consistent behavioral traits were identified from the results to include: the precepts of potential maximization, profit maximization, accommodation principles, survival and cost-minimization principles, and the neutrality axiom. © 2007 by the haworth press, inc. all rights reserved."
"lettau and ludvigson [lettau, m., ludvigson, s, 2001. consumption, aggregate wealth and expected stock returns. journal of finance 56, 815-849] argue that fluctuations from the equilibrium ratio of consumption to wealth (cây) reflect changing expectations of asset returns and document significant short-horizon predictability based on cây. this paper further explores the role of consumer expectations in modeling time variation of expected equity returns by considering two measures of consumer expectations: (i) consumer behavior as reflected in cây, and (ii) a more-direct measure of expectations captured by the index of consumer sentiment (ics). we report strong regression-based evidence of return predictability based on cây, which remains evident even after accounting for various sources of estimation risk. however, the regression-based evidence of predictability does not necessarily imply that shifts in aggregate consumption and the components of aggregate wealth give rise to economically significant investment signals. the survey-based measure of expectations (ics) is shown to complement the behavioral measure (cây) but has no apparent stand-alone predictive value in forecasting equity returns. © 2007 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved."
"organizations in many different industries employ virtual teams in a variety of contexts, including research and development, customer support, software development, and product design. many virtual teams are geographically and culturally dispersed in order to facilitate around-the-clock work and to allow the most qualified individuals to be assigned to a project team. as such dispersion increases, virtual teams tend to experience greater and more diverse conflict compared to co-located teams. since the dynamics of virtual team leadership are not yet well understood, research that examines how team leaders alleviate threats to team cohesion and provide strategies for conflict resolution makes significant contributions to the literature. our study uses a survey-based methodology to examine the perceptions of 159 virtual team members employed by a large u.s. telecommunications corporation and five korean firms involved in construction, finance, business consulting, sales, and distribution. the study integrates the dynamic model of conflict in distributed teams with the behavioral complexity in leadership theory to investigate the roles that virtual team leaders must effectively employ to reduce various forms of virtual team conflict. our findings indicate that communication technologies are effective in reducing task conflict; however, the team leader may also mitigate task conflict by assuming the role of monitor. likewise, process conflict may be abated in the virtual team as the leader performs coordinator activities. an effective virtual team leader exhibits specific roles to manage different types of conflict and the leader's response to conflict plays an important part in virtual team success. © 2008 informs."

"this chapter surveys research in behavioral corporate finance. this research replaces the traditional rationality assumptions with potentially more realistic behavioral assumptions. research in behavioral corporate finance takes two distinct approaches. the first emphasizes that investors are less than fully rational. it views managerial financing and investment decisions as rational responses to securities market mispricing. the second approach emphasizes that managers are less than fully rational. it studies the effect of nonstandard preferences and judgmental biases on managerial decisions. this survey reviews the theory, empirical challenges, and current evidence pertaining to each approach. overall, the behavioral approaches help to explain a number of important financing and investment patterns. it is important to note that the two approaches take very different views about the role and quality of managers, and have very different normative implications as a result. finally, the chapter suggests that the behavioral approaches can help to explain a range of financing and investment patterns, while at the same time depend on a relatively small set of realistic assumptions. © 2007 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved."
"one approach to the analysis of stochastic fluctuations in market prices is to model characteristics of investor behavior and the complex interactions between market participants, with the aim of extracting consequences in the aggregate. this agent-based viewpoint in finance goes back at least to the work of garman [garman, m. (1976). market microstructure. journal of financial economics 3, 257-275] and shares the philosophy of statistical mechanics in the physical sciences. we discuss recent developments in market microstructure models. they are capable, often through numerical simulations, to explain many stylized facts like the emergence of herding behavior, volatility clustering and fat tailed returns distributions. they are typically queuing-type models, that is, models of order flows, in contrast to classical economic equilibrium theories of utility-maximizing, rational, ""representative"" investors. mathematically, they are analyzed using tools of functional central limit theorems, strong approximations and weak convergence. our main examples focus on investor inertia, a trait that is well-documented, among other behavioral qualities, and modeled using semi-markov switching processes. in particular, we show how inertia may lead to the phenomenon of long-range dependence in stock prices. © 2008 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved."
"we developed and tested the validity of a brief scale to assess everyday functioning in persons with serious mental illness. a sample of 434 adults with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were administered the university of california, san diego, performance-based skills assessment (upsa), which assesses functional skills in 5 areas of life functioning (eg, finances and planning). through use of factor analysis, we developed the upsa-brief, which consists of 2 subscales (communication and financial) from the original upsa. upsa-brief scores were correlated with cognitive functioning, symptoms of psychosis, age, and education. we further tested the sensitivity and specificity of the upsa-brief for predicting residential independence using receiver-operating characteristic (roc) curves. finally, sensitivity to change was assessed through comparison of 2 interventions for improving upsa-brief scores. upsa-brief scores were highly correlated with scores on the full version of the upsa (r = .91), with overall cognitive functioning (r = .57), and with negative symptoms (r = -.32). the discriminant validity of the upsa-brief was adequate (roc area under the curve [auc] = 0.73; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 0.67-0.78), with greatest dichotomization for the upsa-brief at a cutoff score of 60. the upsa-brief was significantly better than the dementia rating scale, positive and negative syndromes scale positive, and positive and negative syndromes scale negative at predicting residential independence (all p values <. 05). participants receiving a behavioral intervention also improved significantly compared with a support condition (p = .023). the upsa-brief has adequate psychometric properties, predicts residential independence, is sensitive to change, and requires only 10-15 minutes to administer. therefore, the upsa-brief may be a useful performance-based functional outcome scale. © the author 2007. published by oxford university press on behalf of the maryland psychiatric research center. all rights reserved."
"we briefly review some work on expectations and learning in complex markets, using the familiar demand-supply cobweb model. we discuss and combine two different approaches on learning. according to the adaptive learning approach, agents behave as econometricians using time series observations to form expectations, and update the parameters as more observations become available. this approach has become popular in macro. the second approach has an evolutionary flavor and is sometimes referred to as reinforcement learning. agents employ different forecasting strategies and evaluate these strategies based upon a fitness measure, e.g. past realized profits. in this framework, boundedly rational agents switch between different, but fixed behavioral rules. this approach has become popular in finance. we combine evolutionary and adaptive learning to model complex markets and discuss whether this theory can match empirical facts and forecasting behavior in laboratory experiments with human subjects."

"this paper examines principal and agent networks. we focus on networks because business research has placed far greater emphasis on the agency problem at the individual level. our interest is in exploring the agency relationship at the group or network level. there are many variables at the group or network level which are absent when analyzing agency relationships at the individual level. traditional theories of finance and economics do not adequately address or explain a host of behaviors that are inherent in human interactions that constitute organizational life. we include a sociological or behavioral approach in understanding this complex relationship. using cohesiveness and shared goals as antecedents, we develop a theoretical model that predicts a range of relationship outcomes between principals and agents, as well as their impact on organizational goals. we explain that a range of relationships - including conflict, domination, exploitation, collaboration, and cooperation - is possible when networks of principals and agents interact. we argue that the social context is a key determinant of the relationship between actors in a network, and it has an important role in impacting cohesiveness and goal mutuality. the degree of cohesiveness within and between networks, and the extent to which goals are shared or are in conflict are the principal predictor variables we examine. we posit that cohesiveness and shared goals are necessary and sufficient conditions for agency problems between networks to be alleviated. both necessary and sufficient conditions need to be met in order to overcome the problems of agency. the relationships we examine through the model include cooperation, collaboration, domination, opportunism, exploitation, and conflict. we present a number of propositions that theorize on the nature of the agency relationship and their impact on organizational goals. implications for research and practice are also discussed. © 2007 elsevier inc. all rights reserved."

"background: economic analyses of programs to prevent or treat behavioral health problems among children and youth are an important component of intervention research. aims of the study: this study examines the cost-effectiveness of the fast track intervention, a multi-year, multi-component intervention designed to reduce violence in at-risk children. analytic models estimate intervention cost-effectiveness allowing for sampling variation and considering alternative policy-maker willingness to pay levels. methods: costs of the intervention were estimated using program budgets. the probability of intervention effectiveness is mapped against willingness to pay using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (ceac). cost-effectiveness is gauged using three outcomes measured in grade 9: diagnosis of conduct disorder; acts of interpersonal violence avoided; index criminal offense avoided. results: evaluation of the total sample shows that the intervention was not cost-effective at anticipated levels of policy maker's willingness to pay. for those most at-risk, however, the intervention was likely cost-effective. discussion: outcome measures are based on parent reports and so may be subject to respondent bias. future costs related to conditions such as conduct disorder are speculative based on previous research. implications for health care provision and use: researchers must consider the population targeted for delivery of intervention services when evaluating cost-effectiveness of their intervention. this study indicates that the intervention was cost-effective only for youth most at-risk for behavioral problems. this result implies that overall cost-effectiveness would be improved by better targeting. implications for health policies: the intervention is cost-effective for the highest risk children. from a policy standpoint, this finding is encouraging since such children are likely to generate high costs for taxpayers and society over their lifetimes. nonetheless, the initial outlay required to finance the program is substantial. implications for further research: interventionists should consider program costs in designing interventions in order to better balance feasibility with efficacy. copyright © 2007 icmpe."

"the investment decision-making for endowment insurance fund is one of the important things influencing the reform of endowment insurance system in our country, so constructing proper decision-making model can help to enrich endowment insurance fund decision-making theory and make the insurance market boom. in this paper, adopting the relevant behavioral finance theory, investigators analyzed the fund manager's utility when making investment portfolio decision, constructed the utility function, deduced the probability about the different portfolio, figured out the fund manager's amount investing in the different negotiable securities. this model explained how the investment venture influenced the investment decision-making, and revealed how endowment insurance fund manager's investment preference came into effect in the decision-making."
"this paper investigates the ways in which microfinance provision can unravel and yield perverse outcomes that run counter to its stated objective. it presents a theoretical challenge to the stiglitzian notion that large endowments of social capital induce inexpensive peer-monitoring efforts which render jointly-liable contracts efficient. reliance on a specific set of assumed community characteristics that often do not adequately represent the incentive structure facing borrowers and lenders grossly overestimates the efficiency of informal finance institutions. in particular, by focusing on financial service associations, a specific form of microfinance institution, the effectiveness of such institutions is found to be very sensitive to the behavioral motivations of both clientele and provider, as well as the social norms upon which such transactions take place. © 2006, emerald group publishing ltd."
"in behavioral finance, overconfidence has been established as a prevalent psychological bias, which can make markets less efficient by creating mispricing in the form of excess volatility and return predictability. in this paper, we develop a model in which overconfidence causes investors to overinvest in information acquisition when this information could improve market efficiency by driving prices closer to true values. we study the impact of overconfidence on mispricing and information acquisition, comparing their net effect on prices. we derive several novel implications. first, overconfidence generally improves market pricing provided the level of overconfidence is not too high. pricing can also improve even when overconfidence is arbitrarily high, depending on the amount of private information acquired relative to publicly available information. © 2006 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved."
"the present experiment attempted to scale risk-taking tendencies in typical biases on questions used in the domain of behavioral finance. psychology majors at a private university in tokyo (n = 401) responded to a nine-item questionnaire. the results indicated that the responses to all items could be explained by prospect theory. examination of the tetrachoric correlation coefficient between the items revealed that they were measuring the dimension of risk-taking. an exploratory categorical factor analysis of these data indicated that the order of dimensions measured by the items was one. the factor validity of the risktaking dimension was also checked. after the existence of the risk-taking factor was checked, scaling was tried, using a 2-parameter logistic item response theory (irt) model. item parameters and item characteristic curves were estimated. detection of differential item function (dif) was also attempted; the results suggested that one of the items displayed differential functions between males and females."
"purpose researchers have proposed characteristics-based pricing models as an alternative to risk-based pricing models. while supported empirically, these characteristic-based models lack theoretical support. this paper seeks to reformulate an asset-pricing model (rapm) to demonstrate why firm characteristics help to explain stock returns. design/methodology/approach the rapm is grounded in an economic setting where two groups of agents hold different beliefs about firm fundamental values, and the more sophisticated group (rationals) adopts contrarian strategies against the naïve group (quasis). the model is derived in a static equilibrium within the consumption-investment framework with heterogeneous agents. findings the key theoretical result is a parsimonious equation of cross-sectional expected returns that not only are specified by the traditional risk-return relation, but also are determined by contrarian adjustments at both market-wide and firm-specific levels. when the model is taken to empirical specifications, it leads to consistent explanations for the behaviors of growth and value stocks, and for size and book-to-market effects. research limitations/implications the rapm is a one-period model that assumes that “rationals” have perfect knowledge about “quasis” sentiment parameter and their relative market weights. in future research, it is planned to extend this static model to multiple periods to incorporate a learning process by which “rationals” learn these parameters over time. practical implications the rapm clearly identifies four criteria for implementing arbitrage opportunities in investments. these criteria formalize the common practices in the mutual/hedge fund industry. originality/value the paper develops an original framework that formally supports the characteristics-based models. it offers insights for researchers in behavioral finance and guidelines for investment practitioners. © 2006, emerald group publishing limited"
"huntington's disease may present at any age, but most typically manifests between the ages of 35 and 45 years as a slowly progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder with cognitive and behavioral impairment. it is an autosomal-dominant disorder that has a substantial impact on family structure and dynamics in terms of providing care for affected family members and, for the offspring of an affected parent, dealing with at-risk status. therapy that slows the progressive neuronal dysfunction or degeneration is unavailable, so pharmacotherapy is currently aimed primarily at managing behavioral and psychiatric symptoms, and, in selected cases, controlling severe chorea. effective intervention by clinicians is possible, however, in terms of providing patients and families with accurate information about the disease, counseling them about availability of genetic testing at specialized centers, and in giving them sound advice regarding work, driving, relationships, finances, research participation, and support groups. copyright © 2007 by thieme medical publishers, inc."
"we develop an equilibrium model of learning by rational traders to reconcile several empirical regularities: cross sectionally, most individual speculators lose money; large speculators outperform small speculators; past performance positively affects subsequent trade intensity; most new traders lose money and cease speculation; and performance shows persistence. learning from trading generates substantial endogenous liquidity, reducing bid-ask spreads and the impact of exogenous liquidity shocks on asset prices, but amplifying the effects of real shocks. introducing slightly overconfident traders increases bid-ask spreads, hurting all traders. finally, behavioral theories cannot reconcile all of these empirical regularities. © 2007 by the american finance association."
"this chapter surveys work on dynamic heterogeneous agent models (hams) in economics and finance. emphasis is given to simple models that, at least to some extent, are tractable by analytic methods in combination with computational tools. most of these models are behavioral models with boundedly rational agents using different heuristics or rule of thumb strategies that may not be perfect, but perform reasonably well. typically these models are highly nonlinear, e.g. due to evolutionary switching between strategies, and exhibit a wide range of dynamical behavior ranging from a unique stable steady state to complex, chaotic dynamics. aggregation of simple interactions at the micro level may generate sophisticated structure at the macro level. simple hams can explain important observed stylized facts in financial time series, such as excess volatility, high trading volume, temporary bubbles and trend following, sudden crashes and mean reversion, clustered volatility and fat tails in the returns distribution. © 2006 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved."
"this chapter is about the intersection-or the possible intersection- between the fields of behavioral economics and public finance, which we call behavioral public finance. public finance is a venerable field in the economics fold. its positive and normative branches rest on two basic assumptions. one, and central to public finance's positive agenda, is that individuals are rational, maximizing agents, in the simple sense that they act consistently on the basis of a well-defined utility function.1 we call this the rationality assumption. two, and central to public finance's normative agenda, is that the basis for evaluating social policies should be the well-being of society's members, as they judge this well-being to be. we call this the consumer sovereignty principle. behavioral economics, in contrast, is a newcomer on the social science field. it rests on a series of empirical challenges to the rationality assumption that can, if taken to a certain limit, call the consumer sovereignty principle into question. perhaps because of this perceived nihilistic possibility- or simply because it represents a challenge to received orthodoxy- skeptics continue to question both the facts and the relevance of behavioral economics to any field of study. given this inherent tension, can behavioral public finance be a happy marriage? we believe-however tentatively-that it can. we are more certain that it is important to try and advance the union. to the extent that behavioral economics rests on empirically verifiable (and verified) understandings about how real people think, choose, decide, and act in real life settings, public finance models that aim for real-world relevance ought to take behavioral insights into account. this does not mean abrogating traditional public finance wholesale, or abandoning consumer sovereignty principles. as in all marriages, there will be give and take; the whole will be different from-and at least potentially better than- the sum of the parts. the challenge-as in any marriage-is to keep the lines of communication open. after some additional background comments on the two disciplines, we illustrate the possible relevance of behavioral public finance with three broad clusters of questions, concerning the forms of public finance mechanisms, problems of intertemporal choice, and models of taxpayer compliance. we mean these examples to be suggestive, not definitive. we invite the reader to consider more examples, some of which are provided in the other chapters in this volume. copyright © 2006 by russell sage foundation."

"it is an important issue for economic and finance applications to determine whether individuals exhibit a behavioral bias toward pessimism in their beliefs, in a lottery or more generally in an investment opportunities framework. in this paper, we analyze the answers of a sample of 1,540 individuals to the following question ""imagine that a coin will be flipped 10 times. each time, if heads, you win 10€. how many times do you think that you will win?"" the average answer is surprisingly about 3.9 which is below the average 5, and we interpret this as a pessimistic bias. we find that women are more ""pessimistic"" than men, as are old people relative to young. we also analyze how our notion of pessimism is related to more general notions of pessimism previously introduced in psychology. © springer science+business media b.v. 2006."

"many individuals find it difficult to make decisions about long-term saving e.g. towards retirement. financial regulators are concerned that providers of financial services can 'cherry pick' past performance information and present this selectively in their promotional materials. however, although prior research shows that past investment performance is generally not useful to retail investors in predicting future returns, these consumers continue to place emphasis on this information in their investment decisions. because graphical information can be displayed selectively in a self-serving manner, it is important to test for any effect of prior performance presentation format on investor judgements. in this study, we use actual past performance charts in a controlled experiment to investigate whether (i) the format in which information is provided, and (ii) the timescale of the information provided, affects the investment fund choice of ordinary individuals. we find evidence that presenting past information in terms of fund values or percent yields significantly affects investment fund preference and perceptions of risk and return, but that the timescale of past performance information has no such impact. we discuss our results in the light of prior behavioral finance research and suggest policy implications for regulators. © 2006 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved."
"children in the child welfare system are dependent upon medicaid to finance services for their considerable mental health needs. this study examines the effects of medicaid policies on mental health service use among a national probability sample of children in the child welfare system. data for this study came from the national survey of child and adolescent well-being, the caring for children in child welfare study, and the area resource file. weighted multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to estimate effects of policy variables on children's use of mental health services, controlling for child-level covariates and county-level health resources. children in counties with behavioral carve-outs under medicaid managed care had lower odds of inpatient mental health service use. medicaid managed care enrollment and variations in type of provider reimbursement did not affect use of mental health services. older age, greater need for mental health services, and higher levels of caregiver education were associated with increased odds of service use. restrictions on use of inpatient mental healthcare caused by behavioral carve-outs may disproportionately affect children in the child welfare system who have high rates of such use. careful adoption of carve-outs is necessary to assure appropriate care for these children. © 2006."
"if, as hegel observes, ""the rational is the highroad where everyone travels, where no one is conspicuous"" (cited in knox 1952, 230), then that highroad is surely not sign-posted with the axioms of expected utility theory. rather it is littered with an array of partially analyzed, yet systematic, heuristic responses. the likes of transitivity, strong separability, and the usual rules for combining lotteries have to be replaced by a value function, framing effects, and subjective probabilities that are the product of all sorts of systematic distortions. if these sentences capture the main thrust of behavioral economics, they are relevant when analyzing public finance. when considering activity in stock markets and assessing efficient markets theory, robert shiller comments that by the 1990s ""the field of behavioral finance developed. researchers had seen too many anomalies, too little inspiration that our theoretical models captured important fluctuations"" (2003, 90-91). such comments are equally relevant when considering public finance and when assessing neoclassical economic analysis of tax evasion. a burgeoning empirical literature casts doubt on the proposition that tax evasion reflects the measured decisions of an instrumental calculation of net-expected-utility. neoclassical economic analysis of tax evasion (the allingham-sandmo 1972 model) yields theoretical predictions that often prove at variance with evidence (torgler 2002). individuals do not behave exactly as predicted by this theory. but is this because individuals choose a more attractive decision-making rule, or is it because individuals are simply unable to make decisions as instrumentally as assumed in neoclassical analysis? abehavioral approach to fiscal studies and tax evasion, incorporating input from the softer social sciences, can be traced back to the work of gunter schmolders (1970) and alan lewis (1982). the perceptions, attitudes, values, and morals of taxpayers are key features of the models. voluntary compliance is associated with the perception that tax authorities are honest, a positive attitude toward fiscal policy and the belief that tax evasion is morally wrong-a preference to act ethically. this view of the taxpayer replaces the vision of an individual wealth maximizer weighing up the costs and benefits of evasion with a consumer whose continued good behavior must be nurtured. behavioral models have been influenced by the disciplines of sociology and law (kinsey 1986; irs 1991; slemrod 1992): contributions from psychology being more social in origin. for social psychologists, people look to others in order to decide what is acceptable, reasonable and expected in a given social context; behavior is not seen as a function of individual choice. so the concepts of norms and conformity need to be added to the list of key features. paul webley and colleagues (1991) have argued that many behavioral models take the form of conceptual maps and are consequently not open to empirical test. attempts have been made, however, to combine the realism of behavioral models with the characteristic deductive stance of economics (cullis and lewis 1997). given the asocial nature of economics, it should be no great surprise that the discipline has shown more contemporary interest in cognitive psychology and in particular that branch represented by the work of daniel kahneman and amos tversky (1979, 2000). cognitive psychology is more individualistic and is concerned (among other things) with how people make decisions. cognitive psychologists have always questioned individuals' capacity to engage instrumentally. they question that individuals have the ability to formulate decisions in this way. psychologists insist that individuals are unable to assimilate and deduce as implied in neoclassical theory. certainly, there is now a plethora of heuristics that appear to mitigate the problems of decision making. if analysts face a problem, it is that of assessing which heuristic, which rule of thumb is likely to prove apposite. as elias khalil notes, ""the number of uncovered anomalies is as dizzying as the number of sub-atomic particles discovered by physicists"" (2003, 1). neoclassical economic analysis offers a behavioral assumption for all decisions, but it is premised on axioms that have been called into question and it yields predictions at odds with evidence. individuals do not appear instrumental, but is this because they choose a different (lower cost) way of making decisions or simply because they are prisoners of their own cognitive constraints? there is more than one explanation for the failings of the allingham- sandmo model. we will consider alternative responses later in the chap ter. although critics prescribe solutions, it is difficult to dismiss the proposition that the allingham-sandmo model fails because it is premised on an inaccurate behavioral assumption; individuals are not so instrumental. we then narrow our focus: is it possible to test whether individuals are able to choose to act more (or less) instrumentally? as the quotations from shiller and khalil illustrate, there is now surely ample evidence in behavioral finance of noninstrumental behavior. the questions that remain unresolved are whether individuals choose to rely on a noninstrumental calculus and, if so, how do they make this choice? are individuals always condemned to repeat the same cognitive errors (errors as defined with reference to correct decisions premised on instrumental maximization of net expected utility), or are they able to change? are taxpayers capable of being instrumentally artful when responding to tax authorities, or are they simply artless?. copyright © 2006 by russell sage foundation."
"the behavioral finance literature cites the frozen concentrated orange juice (fcoj) futures market as a prominent example of the failure of prices to reflect fundamentals. in contrast, we show that when theory clearly identifies the fundamental, e.g., at temperatures close to or below freezing, a close link exists between fcoj prices and that fundamental. using a simple, theoretically motivated, nonlinear, state dependent model, we can explain approximately 50% of the return variation on days with freezing temperatures. moreover, while these observations represent less than 4.5% of the winter sample, they account for two-thirds of the entire winter return variability. © 2006 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved."
"the study of capital markets is currently defined by a debate between the orthodox and the behavioral finance literatures. recently, this debate has evolved from individual decisionmaking to overall market processes such as arbitrage. sociologically, both paradigms are subject to the same critique: the two provide a black-and-white, overly dichotomous view of economic knowledge and social interaction, and fail to conceptualize the mediating role of technology. we address these shortcomings and the broader debate on market processes with an ethnographic study of risk arbitrage. arbitrageurs, we find, operate in an environment of knightian uncertainty. they overcome their limited knowledge of the future through a social and material mechanism of ""distributed calculation"" that includes establishing social, cognitive, and technological associations to frame and debate with others about a future that is unknown. our study adds to economic sociology by detailing how calculation itself is social, even in a exceptionally quantitative environment such as an equity derivatives trading room."
"this paper aims to find extensive evidence about how psychological biases affect investor behavior and prices. specifically, we examine pricing effects attributed to representativeness heuristic, which underlie many behavioral finance theories, in the emerging market of china. the contrarian effect of shanghai security exchange (shse) a-shares is investigated using the sample data derived from the shse 180 index (from 1995 to 2003). with characteristics of shse a-share market, the pricing consequences of representativeness bias are described using trends and consistency of a-share price performance, empirical findings confirm the significant contrarian effect in the emerging market of china. this evidence also points to misinterpretations of non-accounting based information as a source of the predictability."

"this paper reexamines the dynamic relation between intraday trading volume and return volatility of large and small nyse stocks in two partitioned samples, with and without identifiable public news. we argue that the sequential information arrival hypothesis (siah) can be tested only in periods containing public news. after partitioning the sample into periods with and without public news, we find bi-directional granger-causality between volume and volatility in the presence of public information as hypothesized by the siah. our analysis further suggests that return volatility is higher in the periods with public news, while trading volume is significantly higher in the no-news period; perhaps owing to the importance of private information for trading stocks. using the sample without public news, we find evidence that volume granger-causes volatility without feedback. these results are broadly consistent with behavioral models like the overconfidence and biased self-attribution model of [daniel, k., hirshleifer, d., subrahmanyam, a., 1998. investor psychology and security market under- and over-reactions. journal of finance 53, 1839-1885]. it appears that overconfident investors overrate the precision of their private news signals and therefore trade too aggressively in the absence of public news; when public news arrives, investors' biased self-attribution triggers excessive return volatility. © 2007 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved."

"a basic tenet of microeconomics suggests that the subjective value of financial gains decreases with increasing assets of individuals (""marginal utility""). using concepts from learning theory and microeconomics, we assessed the capacity of financial rewards to elicit behavioral and neuronal changes during reward-predictive learning in participants with different financial backgrounds. behavioral learning speed during both acquisition and extinction correlated negatively with the assets of the participants, irrespective of education and age. correspondingly, response changes in midbrain and striatum measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging were slower during both acquisition and extinction with increasing assets and income of the participants. by contrast, asymptotic magnitudes of behavioral and neuronal responses after learning were unrelated to personal finances. the inverse relationship of behavioral and neuronal learning speed with personal finances is compatible with the general concept of decreasing marginal utility with increasing wealth. © 2007 elsevier inc. all rights reserved."
"as a developing nation, china should develop perfect catastrophe insurance system to ensure stabilization of society and development of economy. but characteristics of catastrophe insurance breach basic guide line of conventional insurance-the law of the great number, and then lacking risk transferring approach let insurance agents be unwilling to develop catastrophe insurance. catastrophe bond is a new underwriting risk transferring approach. china has basal conditions to develop catastrophe bond. but studies on correlative theories of catastrophe bond hang behind in china. study on catastrophe bond pricing model is the most important in correlative studies. so after considering roundly catastrophe bond's attributes of insurance production and venture capital production, the paper wants to amend the catastrophe bond pricing model that is constructed under risk pricing frame of standard finance by using behavioral finance method. on the base, the paper constructs catastrophe bond pricing model of china according to the situation of china at last. the author hopes that the paper can advance studies on correlative theories of catastrophe bond and let catastrophe bond be issued as soon as possible in china."
"for the past 20 years, practitioner and academic research has highlighted that the performance of companies is linked to staff and management's ways of working, particularly in service-oriented enterprises (a. p. kakabadse, savery, kakabadse, & lee-davies, 2006). yet despite the monumental impact that financial institutions have on a nation's economy, few studies have examined the ways of working of investment dealers. in the finance literature, two distinct bodies of thought have endeavored to grasp the enigmatic nature of financial markets, investor behavior, and investment decision making. these are, on the one hand, the more traditional finance theories and, on the other, behavioral theories that examine, respectively, the quantitative and qualitative psychological attributes of individually driven investment decisions. yet it appears that both areas do not meaningfully consider the impact of contextual dynamics on investment decisions (a. kakabadse, 2000). in response, this article attempts to redress this imbalance by presenting emerging findings from 41 interviews with corporate finance specialists and managers employed in retail and institutional broker departments. presented is an array of evidence highlighting that employees' ways of working are influenced by investment-related demographics - namely, structure of compensation and the disciplined pursuit of relational capital. © 2007 wiley periodicals, inc."
"theoretical models predict that overconfident investors will trade more than rational investors. we directly test this hypothesis by correlating individual overconfidence scores with several measures of trading volume of individual investors. approximately 3,000 online broker investors were asked to answer an internet questionnaire which was designed to measure various facets of overconfidence (miscalibration, volatility estimates, better than average effect). the measures of trading volume were calculated by the trades of 215 individual investors who answered the questionnaire. we find that investors who think that they are above average in terms of investment skills or past performance (but who did not have above average performance in the past) trade more. measures of miscalibration are, contrary to theory, unrelated to measures of trading volume. this result is striking as theoretical models that incorporate overconfident investors mainly motivate this assumption by the calibration literature and model overconfidence as underestimation of the variance of signals. in connection with other recent findings, we conclude that the usual way of motivating and modeling overconfidence which is mainly based on the calibration literature has to be treated with caution. moreover, our way of empirically evaluating behavioral finance models-the correlation of economic and psychological variables and the combination of psychometric measures of judgment biases (such as overconfidence scores) and field data-seems to be a promising way to better understand which psychological phenomena actually drive economic behavior. © 2007 the geneva association."
"keynes drew upon psychology in developing his economic theories, and researchers in behavioral finance have integrated psychology into the study of how investors make financial decisions. another group of researchers, experimental economists, tested some remarks of keynes on the psychology of economic actors in specifically designed experiments. some research in these fields, however, has been misguided because of an inadequate understanding of keynes's original insights. researchers in these fields can benefit from comments by post keynesian economists. at the same time, they have a lot to offer post keynesians in developing a post keynesian theory of finance. © 2006 m.e. sharpe, inc."
we investigate jump memory using an extensive database of short-term s&p 500 index options. jump memory refers to the attenuation of the implied jump intensity and magnitude parameters following a crash event. we use a genetic algorithm to obtain a time series of implied parameter estimates and posit behavioral and rational explanations for parameter attenuation following a crash event. we find that a nested form of the jump-diffusion model sharpens the remaining parameter estimates and has a negligible effect on pricing accuracy. © 2007 the southern finance association and the southwestern finance association.
"according to behavioral finance, investors' behavioral biases will be reflected in the distribution of the return rate. this paper constructs a numerical simulation model to simulate the return rate distribution under the influences of overconfidence and regret aversion and shows that, compared with normal distribution under the efficient market hypothesis, the simulated distributions have higher peaks and fatter tails, and they are skewed to left with the left tails thicker than the right ones. moreover, the heights of peaks and the thickness of tails will decrease as the time horizons for the returns become longer. further numerical experiments illustrate that, when the time lag of reaction increase, the kurtosis of the simulated distribution has an obvious increase, and the left tail tends to decrease; when under-reaction aggravates, the kurtosis and the thickness exhibit a concurrent increase; when the degree of over-reaction becomes large, the right tail has an obvious increase; the right tail is insensitive, while the thickness of the left tail tends to decrease with the increasing of the disposition effect."
"behavioral economics questions the basic underpinnings of economic theory, showing that people often do not act consistently in their own self-interest when making economic decisions. while these findings have important theoretical implications, they also provide a new lens for examining public policies, such as taxation, public spending, and the provision of adequate pensions. how can people be encouraged to save adequately for retirement when evidence shows that they tend to spend their money as soon as they can? would closer monitoring of income tax returns lead to more honest taxpayers or a more distrustful, uncooperative citizenry? behavioral public finance, edited by edward mccaffery and joel slemrod, applies the principles of behavioral economics to government's role in constructing economic and social policies of these kinds and suggests that programs crafted with rational participants in mind may require redesign. behavioral public finance looks at several facets of economic life and asks how behavioral research can increase public welfare. deborah a. small, george loewenstein, and jeff strnad note that public support for a tax often depends not only on who bears its burdens, but also on how the tax is framed. for example, people tend to prefer corporate taxes over sales taxes, even though the cost of both is eventually extracted from the consumer. james j. choi, david laibson, brigitte c. madrian, and andrew metrick assess the impact of several different features of 401(k) plans on employee savings behavior. they find that when employees are automatically enrolled in a retirement savings plan, they overwhelmingly accept the status quo and continue participating, while employees without automatic enrollment typically take over a year to join the saving plan. behavioral public finance also looks at taxpayer compliance. while the classic economic model suggests that the low rate of irs audits means far fewer people should voluntarily pay their taxes than actually do, john cullis, philip jones, and alan lewis present new research showing that many people do not underreport their incomes even when the probability of getting caught is a mere one percent. human beings are not always rational, utility-maximizing economic agents. behavioral economics has shown how human behavior departs from the assumptions made by generations of economists. now, behavioral public finance brings the insights of behavioral economics to analysis of policies that affect us all. copyright © 2006 by russell sage foundation. all rights reserved."

"behavioral economics considers the ways that actual people make economic decisions and take economic actions (thaler 1980; kahneman and tversky 2000; sunstein 2000). in a nutshell, people make mistakes, showing inconsistent judgment in the face of framing and other formal manipulations of the presentation of choice problems. most everyone, it seems, likes the glass half full; few like it half empty. behavioral public finance, we believe, ought to consider how ordinary people think about specifically governmental actions, paradigmatically tax and spending programs. our experiments have shown that, in general, people suffer from much the same heuristics and biases in thinking about public as private finance. and their decisions about public finance are typically less subject to the discipline that feedback, as through private market mechanisms, provides. in our thinking about people's thinking about public finance, we group a cluster of biases as specific instances of a more general isolation effect, whereby people make decisions about complex subjects quickly, responding to the most salient aspects of a choice or decision set, ignoring or underusing logically relevant information not immediately before them. although we follow some in calling this an isolation effect (camerer 2000; kahneman and lovallo 1993; mccaffery and baron 2003; read, loewenstein, and rabin 1999), others have called the phenomenon a focusing effect (idson et al. 2004; jones et al. 1998; legrenzi, girotto, and johnson-laird 1993). the idea of the focusing effect came from the theory of mental models in reasoning, as legrenzi and his colleagues explained: people reason from mental models, and when possible they use a single, simple model that represents just the information they are given. other factors are ignored or underused. whatever it is called, this tendency to make decisions while considering only part of a global whole, as if with blinders on, can have dramatic consequences for how people think about government tax and spending programs. this matters, because we assume that public opinion matters- it helps shape and constrain what public officials do (steinmo 1993). and public opinion may be out of step with a better informed public policy, on account of the heuristics and biases. as kahneman (2000) has demonstrated in the private context, the utility weights people use in deciding on matters of relevance to them differ from those they later experience as a result of their choices. in the cases we explore here, we find that the amount and extent of redistribution that subjects support varies with the form of public finance policy. the reason is that people are not considering the total effects of a particular policy change-such as using deductions to help subsidize private choices, or privatizing government services-on global patterns of distribution. preference shifts and reversals occur based on the framing of public finance issues. the people can wake up with a tax and transfer system that they have chosen but do not want. consider, for example, an instance of an isolation effect we termed disaggregation bias (mccaffery and baron 2003). we asked subjects what they thought would be a fair distribution of tax burdens across different households at different income levels. in a series of screens presented on a web site, we listed one tax system, identified as either payroll or income, and asked the subjects either to set only the other tax system or to set the entire, aggregated tax system. we thereby replicated the effects of income tax reform given a payroll tax system in place-offstage, as it were. rational choice theory suggests that the distributive characteristics of any one tax system, such as the payroll tax, should not matter, as long as a policy maker could adjust another tax, such as the income tax, to effect her desired bottom line. we found that most subjects desired at least a moderately progressive tax system when asked to design a whole. but when half of the revenue was collected by one tax, subjects underadjusted when choosing a tax system for the other half, though they were transparently able to achieve the same overall level of redistribution (progressiveness) as when they were choosing an entire system. in sum, subjects focused in only on what they were being asked to choose, making it moderately progressive-just as they wanted the system as a whole to be-though the global tax system then varied dramatically, depending on the properties of the so-called offstage tax. these and related cognitive limitations raise troubling issues for the traditional practice of public finance. the two welfare theorems of neoclassical welfare economics suggest a two-part agenda for public finance, and for economic regulation more generally (kaplow and shavell 2000). first, policy makers should choose socioeconomic policies that maximize social welfare, for which wealth-maximization typically serves as a suitable proxy. second, policy makers should redistribute the greater social wealth, through a tax and transfer system, to achieve a desired location on the pareto frontier. in public finance, this means that decisions about the proper role for the government, and the structure of that role-what public goods ought to be provided, to what extent, and how financed- should be made in a strict welfare maximizing fashion, minimizing the deadweight losses or excess burdens of the fiscal intervention (musgrave 1959; rosen 2001). logically, in other words, the welfarist view of public finance entails separating the allocative and distributive dimensions of public finance to achieve an optimal merger of efficiency and equity concerns, in the spirit, say, of rawls's difference principle (1971), or of the utilitarian argument that the declining marginal utility of money justifies some redistribution. if a current government program is inefficiently designed, social welfare can be enhanced-and all individuals in society can stay at the same or a higher level of personal welfare-by moving to a more efficient government (or private) provision, coupled with a redistribution of the greater wealth within the pareto constraint. so it is in logic. but cognitive biases may get in the way of ordinary people understanding matters once two or more aspects of government action are separated. the experiments we detail here explore ways in which the extent of redistribution that people are willing to support depends on the form of government provision of goods and services. we ask whether people take into account the distributional effects of two kinds of policy changes: the use of tax deductions as a way of funding services, and the effect of privatization or elimination of government services and programs. our main hypothesis is that, by failing to take distributional effects fully into account, people end up supporting policies that undercut their own values. these decisional biases can lead to violations of the two welfare theorems by generating a conflict between equity and efficiency-between total social wealth and the well-being of society's members-that does not exist in pure, rational theory. copyright © 2006 by russell sage foundation."
"recently, several behavioral finance models based on the overconfidence hypothesis have been proposed to explain anomalous findings, including a short-term continuation (momentum) and a long-term reversal in stock returns. we characterize the overconfidence hypothesis by the following four testable implications: first, if investors are overconfident, they overreact to private information and underreact to public information. second, market gains make overconfident investors trade more aggressively in subsequent periods. third, excessive trading of overconfident investors in securities markets contributes to the observed excessive volatility. fourth, overconfident investors underestimate risk and trade more in riskier securities. to document the presence of overconfidence in financial markets, we empirically evaluate these four hypotheses using aggregate data. overall, we find empirical evidence in support of the four hypotheses. © 2006 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved."
"the movements of financial markets, and their connections to the macro economy are one of the most difficult areas for traditional economic theories. this is true both from an empirical and a theoretical perspective. this chapter will concentrate on the empirical puzzles from finance that demand new approaches, such as agent-based financial markets. it will be argued that even when traditional modeling approaches fit some subset of empirical features, it comes with the cost of moving farther from economic believability and robustness. agent-based approaches fit more features with frameworks that seem to make more intuitive sense for the functioning of real markets. also, agent-based frameworks can be used as a test bed for drawing in behavioral results found in both experimental and micro level financial markets. this is crucial for understanding when and where behavioral quirks of economic actors will appear at the macro level. many of the most puzzling results from finance deal with problems of behavioral heterogeneity, and the dynamics of heterogeneity. the study of market heterogeneity as a kind of complicated dynamic state variable that needs to be modeled is probably one of the defining features of agent-based models. empirical features such as trading volume are directly related to the amount of heterogeneity in the market, and demand models that can speak to this issue. other empirical features are probably indirectly related. © cambridge university press 2006."
"researchers in strategic management and finance agree that organizational risk (i.e., variations in firm returns) should influence capital investments decisions. however, the risk-capital investments relationship remains scantily explored. in this study we examine three issues: 1) how does organizational risk affect decisions about capital investments from a longitudinal perspective?, 2) do organizational risk and decisions about capital investments jointly influence firm performance?, and 3) is this relationship contingent on organizational context? the analysis of pooled cross-sectional time-series data for 1,284 u.s. firms over a period of 12 years shows that organizational risk and variation in capital investments are related, but the extent of their relation depends on the organizational context. in addition, firms that face greater organizational risk and are more flexible in their capital investments outperform firms that are less flexible. overall, this longitudinal study provides support for a behavioral contingency approach to understanding capital investments decisions by showing that the link between organizational risk and firm performance is dependent on the flexibility in capital investments decisions."
"purpose - this paper seeks to unravel some of the challenges associated with responsible investment from the institutional investor's perspective, focusing on how dominant conventions influence investor behavior and their ability to invest responsibly. design/methodology/approach - the research draws from three longitudinal case studies that were carried out on uk institutions that have adopted a responsible investment policy. findings - evidence of behavioral obstacles to responsible investing were found, including short-termism, gravitation towards defensible decisions and reluctance to integrate corporate responsibility factors into the core investment process. based on the case study evidence these appear to be driven by the influence of prevailing dominant conventions, reinforced by institutional herding tendencies. research limitations/implications - the paper introduces some preliminary thoughts as to how conventions might be resisted and changed over time through the institutional herding mechanism. further research is required (and is currently under way) to more closely examine the potential impact of investor collaboration for challenging dominant conventions. practical implications - collaboration amongst institutional investors is key for mobilizing institutional herding tendencies so that responsible investment might get built into conventions. originality/value - the research combines responsible investment literature with behavioral finance studies on investor behavior, herding tendencies and the influence of conventions. it also illuminates the complexities in investor behavior from which other institutional investors might learn in implementing a responsible investment policy. © emerald group publishing limited."
"bsv (barberis, huang and vishny [1998]) model is one of the most important explanative models in the area of behavioral finance. the existing bsv model is a model of how behavioral investors form beliefs, which produces both overreaction and mean-reversion for a wide range of parameter values. however, bsv model does not address the market equilibrium problems, which is critical for the asset pricing theory. thus the following 2 questions are meaningful for the existing bsv model to be extended to an equilibrium model in which there are both bsv investors and rational investors in a market of risky asset: will bsv model maintain its explanative power if rational investors are introduced? who will lose money to their counterparts in trading of risky assets, the behavioral investors or the rational investors? in this paper, we present an agent-based computational model of the dynamic game between bsv investors and rational investors. the results of our model answer the above two questions. first, the introduction of rational investors to the market of risky asset will not eliminate the anomalies of overreaction and mean-reversion. we believe that it is because the unpredictability of bsv agents' behavior adds the total risk of risky asset, which in turn prevents rational investors from taking unlimited position to arbitrage. at that time, the risky asset is mispriced. second, we do not find any evidence that the behavioral investors will lose money to their counterparts although their cognitive bias causes them to form a false kind of expectation on the future price of the risky asset. on the contrary, some weak evidence on that behavioral investors are less likely to bankrupt is reported. we contribute it to that bsv investors will be overcautious when the market price is going down continuously due to their cognitive bias, and then decrease the probability of bankruptcy. while at that time, rational investors will try to correct the market price distorted by bsv investors and thus take an additional arbitrage position, which may increase their returns, but will increase the probability of bankruptcy."
"the efficient market hypothesis (emh hereafter) considers security markets as efficient mechanism for immediate and unbiased incorporation of new information into prices. within the emh, as argued by friedman [14] and fama [11], the presence of non-rational traders can be neglected, since their idiosyncratic errors would be averaged out in the aggregate so that they could not significantly affect the market price. rather, they would progressively lose money in favor of arbitrageurs, betting against them, so that the less rational agents would eventually disappear at the end from the market. recent empirical and theoretical investigations have attacked the emh and its implications in various ways. from a theoretical viewpoint, it has been shown that arbitrageurs may have limited capacity to drive the prices close enough to the fundamental value, if they have a finite time horizon, or in the presence of fundamental risks - see figlewski [12] and shiller [24]. the seminal paper by de long et al. [10] has demonstrated that noise traders can create ""their own space"" in the market and that they might even earn higher returns than sophisticated investors. from an empirical point of view, the most relevant piece of evidence against the emh is excess volatility of prices when compared to the underlying fundamentals, as pointed out by west [26] among others. one might also ask whether it is plausible that informationally efficient prices would give rise to the long list of extremely robust statistical findings such as the conditional structure of the volatility itself - from the arch effect, to the multi-scaling of the level of fluctuations of returns - or the fatness of the tails of the distribution of returns (for an authoritative survey see for instance pagan [23]). the presence of those complex empirical regularities embedded in the time series of prices may also cast some doubts on the simple one-to-one relationship between price changes and information as implied by the emh. if we assume that the ""relevant"" information is made up of a collection of non-correlated news, economical, political and even meteorological, it is hard to justify that such 'a composite 'assortment"" of news possesses the complex temporal structure observed for volatility. anyhow, a strict empirical validation of such a relationship is practically impossible, since the information arrival process is not directly observable. from the viewpoint of agent-based models, these empirical findings might alternatively be viewed as the imprint of an endogenous dynamics of the market which might be partially decoupled from fundamental factors. several authors have attempted to model financial markets as a system of heterogeneous interacting agents, whose activities might be responsible for this intrinsic force. a long, however partial, list of contributions in this vein ranges from the (very) early papers of baumol [6] and zeeman [27], to recent research on noise traders, fundamentalist/chartist interaction and 'artificial' financial markets (arthur et al. [5], de long et al. [10], kirman [18] and beja and goldman [7] being some prominent examples). much of this literature on financial markets from a dynamical system perspective has developed in parallel with the behavioral finance literature and choice-theoretical works on financial 'anomalies', explaining the rational behavioral roots of overcorrection, herding behavior and other formerly puzzling observations (cf. [8]). despite many differences, available dynamic market models can successfully replicate the key stylized facts and explain their universality as an emergent property of the interactions among traders. the complexity of these interacting agent models has largely constrained their analytical treatment, limiting their analysis mainly to monte carlo simulations. in order to overcome this limitation, we introduce a 'minimalist' model of an artificial financial market, along the lines of our previous contributions ([3, 1, 2]), based on herding behavior among two types of traders. the simplicity of the model allows for an almost complete analytical characterization of both conditional and unconditional statistical properties of prices and returns. moreover, the underlying parameters of the model can be estimated directly, which permits an assessment of its goodness-of-fit for empirical data. while the performance of the model for domestic stock markets has been the focus of a previous contribution, in this paper we report results for selected exchange rates against the us dollar."
"this chapter highlights the relationship among operational risk, darley's law, and behavioral finance. it then reviews darley's warnings on the unintended consequences of overly objective systems, and raises issues about the dynamics of authority influence. this warning about the dynamics of authority influence is something of which everyone must be aware. next, the chapter examines well-publicized cases that demonstrate darley's warnings being played out. it reviews the role in which risk management can be employed to help with the mitigation of incentive-misalignment risks. the chapter concludes with a warning about the importance that one should assign to ethical standards for risk management employees and reward systems that do not counteract the adherence to these ethical standards. darley's law is a good warning to the organizations that employ overly objective incentive systems and likewise to those who pursue risk management as primarily a control tool or quantitative science. © 2006 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.."
"the principle that financial markets accurately reflect the underlying value of traded stocks has been widely accepted in the investment world since the 1960s. it is predicated on the assumption that investors make buy or sell decisions based on a rational view of a company's future cash flow, after considering all the relevant information. the role of the markets is to allocate capital to companies efficiently. recently, however, this rational view has been under attack from adherents of behavioral finance, who argue that stock markets do not reflect economic fundamentals as well as people think they do. the authors maintain that there are instances when stock market valuations can and do make significant and lasting deviations from a company's intrinsic value. however, according to the authors' analysis, the significant discrepancies between market value and intrinsic value are both rare and short-lived. the article cites several examples, including the late 1970s, when inflation-conscious investors pushed stock valuations too low, and the ""internet bubble"" of the late 1990s. on the whole, the authors argue, financial markets value investments efficiently - even if some people invest irrationally some of the time. although managers may occasionally find ways to take advantage of short-term discrepancies, the authors say the only way they will be able to do so is by understanding the real underlying values."
"this book is a case study of structural reform in the japanese financial sector. it adopts a novel approach, combining rational choice analysis from the field of political science with comparative institutional analysis from the field of economics. its central hypothesis is that japanese politics and policymaking have changed due to a combination of policy failures and scandals, as well as the emergence of the possibility of a change in government after 37 years of uninterrupted liberal democratic party (ldp) rule. these factors are likely to affect other policy areas, meaning that decay in the financial policymaking process may lead to changes throughout the political economy. in making this argument, the book attempts to provide a realistic image of post-1995 financial politics by improving on existing behavioral assumptions of actors. it demonstrates that the big bang can be best understood as an outcome of the strategic interaction of state actors. more specifically, the big bang is the product of interaction between the ldp and ministry of finance, each pursuing organizational survival through cooperation, competition, and confrontation. the book is divided into three parts. part i discusses the conceptual tools and background information in preparation for later analysis. part ii provides an empirical analysis of financial politics. part iii attempts to make sense of the developments analyzed in part ii by returning to the analytical frameworks developed in part i. © riina toya, hiromichi toya and kiyoka toya, 2006. all rights reserved."
"this paper proposes a functional approach to designing and managing the financial systems of countries, regions, firms, households, and other entities. it is a synthesis of the neoclassical, neo-institutional, and behavioral perspectives. neoclassical theory is an ideal driver to link science and global practice in finance because its prescriptions are robust across time and geopolitical borders. by itself, however, neoclassical theory provides little prescription or prediction of the institutional structure of financial systems—that is, the specific kinds of financial intermediaries, markets, and regulatory bodies that will or should evolve in response to underlying changes in technology, politics, demographics, and cultural norms. the neoclassical model therefore offers important, but incomplete, guidance to decision makers seeking to understand and manage the process of institutional change. in accomplishing this task, the neo-institutional and behavioral perspectives can be very useful. in this proposed synthesis of the three approaches, functional and structural finance (fsf), institutional structure is endogenous. when particular transaction costs or behavioral patterns produce large departures from the predictions of the ideal frictionless neoclassical equilibrium for a given institutional structure, new institutions tend to develop that partially offset the resulting inefficiencies. in the longer run, after institutional structures have had time to fully develop, the predictions of the neoclassical model will be approximately valid for asset prices and resource allocations. through a series of examples, the paper sets out the reasoning behind the fsf synthesis and illustrates its application. © 2006 by world scientific publishing co. pte. ltd."

"there is substantial evidence of short-term stock price continuation, which the prior literature often attributes to investor behavioral biases such as underreaction to new information. this paper investigates the role of information uncertainty in price continuation anomalies and cross-sectional variations in stock returns. if short-term price continuation is due to investor behavioral biases, we should observe greater price drift when there is greater information uncertainty. as a result, greater information uncertainty should produce relatively higher expected returns following good news and relatively lower expected returns following bad news. my evidence supports this hypothesis. 2006 by the american finance association."
"the immediate expensing of research and development (r&d) expenditures is often justified by the conservatism principle. however, no accounting procedure consistently applied can be conservative throughout the firm's life. we therefore ask the following questions: (1) when is the expensing of r&d conservative and when is it aggressive, relative to r&d capitalization? (2) what are the capital-market implications of these reporting biases? to address these questions we construct a model of profitability biases (differences between reported profitability under r&d expensing and capitalization) and show that the key drivers of the reporting biases are the differences between r&d growth and earnings growth (momentum), and between r&d growth and return on equity (roe). companies with a high r&d growth rate relative to their profitability (typically early life-cycle companies) report conservatively, while firms with a low r&d growth rate (mature companies) tend to report aggressively under current generally accepted accounting principles. our empirical analysis, covering the period 1972-2003, generally supports the analytical predictions. in the valuation analysis we find evidence consistent with investor fixation on the reported profitability measures: we detect undervaluation of conservatively reporting firms and overvaluation of aggressively reporting firms. these misvaluations appear to be corrected when the reporting biases reverse from conservative to aggressive and vice versa. this evidence is consistent with behavioral finance arguments about investor cognitive biases. © caaa."
"to provide a correct guidance for investors, the factors influencing the choice of venture investment behavior of investors were investigated from the point of view of behavioral finance and through analyzing the risk-averse utility curves, expected utility, investment net present value and opportunity cost for an investor. these influential factors include the definition of an investor's attitude to venture investment, the arrangement of investment tools in phases, the holding of opportunity cost in investment decision and the application of investment options. the research shows that investor's attitude to investment venture directly affects the seeking to venture profit and reflects the mental critical of the investor to venture endurance. along with the development of a venture enterprise, the investment trends to equity rights and debt rights of an investor will decrease and increase respectively. when the unit output price of items remains constant, whether to keep or to exert the options lies on the comparison between opportunity cost and net investment income. on the contrary, whether investor waiting for or raising investment will be determined by the decrease or increase of unit output price."
"this paper draws from behavioral finance theory to provide an alternative explanation to the efficient market hypothesis that investor under- and overreactions occur by chance. hypotheses propose relationships between information technology/systems outsourcing (hereafter it/is) decisions on short- and long-term abnormal returns, while exploring the potentially confounding effect of organizational restructuring events that frequently follow such decisions. using event studies techniques, it is found that although it/is outsourcing announcements are positively related to short-term abnormal returns, restructuring charges after the announcement moderate the relationship between the short-term effect of such announcements and long-term abnormal returns, so that long-term returns become negative when followed by organizational restructuring efforts resulting from it/is outsourcing. © 2005 elsevier inc. all rights reserved."
"the behavioral finance revolution in academic finance in the last several decades is best described as a return to a more eclectic approach to financial modeling. the earlier neoclassical finance revolution that had swept the finance profession in the 1960s and 1970s represented the overly-enthusiastic pursuit of only one model. freed from the tyranny of just one model, financial research is now making faster progress, and that progress can be expected to show material benefits. an example of the application of both behavioral finance and neoclassical finance is discussed: the reform of social security and the introduction of personal accounts. © 2017 wiley. all rights reserved."

"in this paper, we propose a new approach to estimating the systematic risk (beta) of china stock market. the proposed method is based on maximal overlap discreet wavelet transform (modwt) that provides a natural platform to investigate the beta behavior at different time horizons without losing any information. the experimental results are different with conclusion from other stock market, the paper explains it from character of china stock and behavioral finance. the empirical results show that the predictions of the capm model are more relevant at short time horizons as compared to long. © 2005 ieee."
"a series of financial anomalies motivated the development of new theories that modify the rational expectations ideal. two possibilities have been systematically explored. the literature on behavioral finance relaxes the assumption that agents form beliefs according to the laws of probability and assume, instead, that simpler heuristic rules are used. another stream of the literature assumes that agents process information according to bayes' rule, but do not posses sufficient information to know the true data generating process. in this paper, bayesian and behavioral agents coexist and trade in a standard dynamic asset pricing model. a long-standing conjecture is demonstrated. it is shown that, under suitable assumptions, bayesian agents drive behavioral, non-bayesian agents out of the market. hence, asset prices are eventually determined under the bayesian paradigm."
"this article pulls together streams of culture-related research found in information-processing and behavioral decision theory literature, and it complements them with a focus on motivations and goals. the authors propose a framework that suggests that (1) the treatment of culture is useful when it incorporates subcultures, including those defined by nationality, ethnicity, religious affiliation, and neighborhood or local surroundings; (2) goals are determined by both cultural background and situational forces; and (3) through its impact on goals, culture influences the inputs used to make a decision, the types of options preferred, and the timing of decisions. the authors highlight the implications of the framework for two policy domains: health and finances. they suggest that consumers' goal orientations can provide a useful segmentation dimension, and they carve out specific tendencies that appear to vary across cultural contexts (e.g., satisficing, goal shifting, reactivity). a deeper consideration of consumer goals and the role of culture in individual decision making can inform policies aimed at improving the quality of consumers' decisions and, ultimately, consumer welfare. © 2006, american marketing association."
"a quarter century old and still going strong, the hiv/aids pandemic is already the deadliest and longest lasting plague in mankind's recorded history. reportedly among the weakest of the viruses, hiv's survival instincts have relied on extreme adaptability at the molecular and virologic levels on its part. in addition, it has preyed on certain prevalent weaknesses on the part of its host (human society) - extreme poverty; gender bias; lack of education and high prevalence of stis- to prolong its lethal grip on humanity for as long as possible. this astounding adaptability is evident by the tremendous geographic, gender, mode of transmission and age shifts it has displayed over its now respectably long history. from localized epidemics in localities in the developed world at its onset, it has gravitated and now firmly entrenched itself selecting sub-saharan africa as the epicenter of its global scourge. from a disease of men having sex with men (msms) at its inception, it has undergone a gender shift with a definite and alarming ""feminization'"" or as kofi annan put it, has the ""face of a woman"". from a demonstrable prevalence, concentrating in adults, it has chillingly shifted to being an infection that affects predominantly younger age groups and adolescents. and from its early homosexual and injection drug use transmission modes it has shifted to a predominantly heterosexual transmission for the majority of new infections. behavioral modifications (health education towards safe sexual practices and vct provision and utilization); correct and consistent use of male and female condoms; control of sexually transmitted diseases and strategies to prevent mother to child transmission (pmtct) are effective methods of hiv/aids prevention. their effectiveness has been demonstrated by their ability to contain the epidemic in countries that have successfully implemented them. of questionable value in prevention but gaining momentum in accumulating data proving their effectiveness in hiv prevention are strategies including male circumcision; pep (post-exposure prophylaxis); prep (pre-exposure prophylaxis) and provision of ante-retroviral therapy to all who are in need. experiences in prevention efforts in resource-poor settings over the last two decades have indicated that the traditional abc model (abstinence, being faithful to one's partner and condom use) are inadequate in controlling hiv in those settings. well-known biologic vulnerabilities in women as well as socio-economic, cultural and gender bias towards women, stand in the way of effective implementation of the available prevention strategies. it has become increasingly evident that as part of a comprehensive hiv prevention strategy, a female-controlled method of prevention is crucial for the eventual control of the epidemic in africa. to this end, efforts to develop a ""microbicide""- a topical agent that can be applied vaginally by women to protect themselves from infection; and a product that they can use without the necessary consent of their partner - have been gathering momentum over the last decade. at present, nearly sixty potential microbicides are in the development pipeline. of these six are in the last (phase iii) effectiveness trials that precede drug licensing. there is a general belief in the scientific community that an effective microbicidal agent for hiv prevention might be available in the next five to seven years. lack of finance and ethical issues in conducting research are delaying rapid development of an effective agent. ethiopia has been largely left out of research efforts towards microbicides development. it is essential that cognizance of this emerging hiv prevention strategy by health care professionals and the general public be developed in order to avoid undue delays in effective utilization once an effective agent becomes part of our hiv prevention arsenal."
"the life-cycle portfolio proposal for personal accounts within a social security system would have the government undertake the dynamic portfolio allocation program for individuals. this paper evaluates, using u.s. historical data 1871-2004, several versions of conventional life-cycle portfolios. the results show disappointing performance relative to the rhetoric of the promoters of the proposal. dynamic portfolio theory suggests that the optimal life-cycle portfolio may look very different from the conventional form. moreover, behavioral finance suggests that the design of a life-cycle portfolio for social security should consider the attitudes and habits of individuals and as well as their diversity. © 2005 society for policy modeling."
"a catastrophe theory model modified for the explanation of the evolution/revolution of behavior in the securities market can be classified in the realm of behavioral finance. (see thaler, 1993; statman, 1998 and pruden, 1989). an early model of the cusp catastrophe model modified to explain specul ative crashes appeared in zeeman (1976, 1977). later, pruden (1979) expanded upon zeeman’s use of the cusp model version of calaslrophe theory to allow for “buying stampedes” as well as “selling panics”. pruden (1980) also established connections between the cusp catastrophe model and technical market analysis. 1 whereas the calaslrophe theory model, like other models from the behavi oral sciences, provides a positive scientific theory as to the “why” of behavior in the stock market, technical market analysis furnishes a nominal theory of rules and principles about “how” a trader or investor may profit from the behavior observed in the stock market. hence, the presupposition is that behavioral science models that explain the stock market behavior provide solid scientific foundations upon which to base the principles and practices of technical market analysis. © emerald group publishing limited 2005."
"huntington’s disease (hd) is an autosomal, dominant, neurodegenerative disorder that results from an unstable expansion of the trinucleotide repeat cag in the gene it-15 on chromosome 4 (1–8). hd has a prevalence of 5–10 per 100,000 population. in the united states, there are approximately 30,000 individuals with clinical features of hd and approximately 200,000 individuals felt to be at an immediate risk for hd. the clinical features of hd usually emerge in adulthood (mean age of 37 years) characterized by the primary motor features of chorea, abnormal eye movements, dystonia, and in later-stage disease bradykinesia. it is well established that 100% of the patients experience progressive intellectual dysfunction culminating in global dementia. psychiatric and behavioral symptoms also occur in a majority of patients. symptoms of hd lead to progressive functional disability and death over a period of 10–30 years. the stage of hd is classified by the total functional capacity (tfc) scale based upon the patient’s capacity to engage in employment, attend to finances, maintain domestic and personal daily activities, and ability to remain cared for in the primary residence (9). the tfc has been reliably shown to decline on average between 0.75 and 1.0 points per year and correlates with radiographic abnormalities, severity of the movement disorder, and cognitive dysfunction (10,11). © 2006 by taylor and francis group, llc."
"the behavioral origins of the stylized facts of financial returns have been addressed in a growing body of agent-based models of financial markets. while the traditional efficient market viewpoint explains all statistical properties of returns by similar features of the news arrival process, the more recent behavioral finance models explain them as imprints of universal patterns of interaction in these markets. in this paper we contribute to this literature by introducing a very simple agent-based model in which the ubiquitous stylized facts (fat tails, volatility clustering) are emergent properties of the interaction among traders. the simplicity of the model allows us to estimate the underlying parameters, since it is possible to derive a closed form solution for the distribution of returns. we show that the tail shape characterizing the fatness of the unconditional distribution of returns can be directly derived from some structural variables that govern the traders' interactions, namely the herding propensity and the autonomous switching tendency. © springer science + business media, inc. 2005."
"the principal purpose of this study is to piece together the important development and contributions by efficient market hypothesis, bounded rationality, behavioral finance, neurofinance, and the recently introduced adaptive market hypothesis. in the process the author will review the selected literature so that they can be linked together for further consideration and development. when monthly and daily data for s&p 500, djia, and nasdaq indexes were analyzed from 1971 to 2005, the author found long string of positive and significant autocorrelations and great volatility, which were not consistent with the efficient market hypothesis. the international market indexes from japan, hong kong, singapore, mexico, taiwan, and canada are also very volatile even though they show less volatility compared to the u.s. indexes. since amh was introduced in 2004, it is promising but is still at its infant stage of development. finally, the neural/ medical finance can help us understand the brain activities when investors are making investing and trading decisions, and the effect of drugs on brain and investment decision-making. the future of neurofinance and amh appears to be promising. © k.c. tseng, 2006."
"recent studies in behavioral finance establish that active traders may underperform those who trade less. such a result is partly due to the persistently high annual net returns earned by well-diversified portfolios in stock markets. this paper shows that the buy-and-hold strategy as a nonactive trading rule may yield huge net returns under the prescriptions of a classifier system, even in an extremely volatile and horizontal market, namely, the istanbul stock exchange. © 2006 m.e. sharpe, inc. all rights reserved."
"this book offers a definitive and wide-ranging overview of developments in behavioral finance over the past ten years. in 1993, the first volume provided the standard reference to this new approach in finance--an approach that, as editor richard thaler put it, ""entertains the possibility that some of the agents in the economy behave less than fully rationally some of the time."" much has changed since then. not least, the bursting of the internet bubble and the subsequent market decline further demonstrated that financial markets often fail to behave as they would if trading were truly dominated by the fully rational investors who populate financial theories. behavioral finance has made an indelible mark on areas from asset pricing to individual investor behavior to corporate finance, and continues to see exciting empirical and theoretical advances. advances in behavioral finance, volume ii constitutes the essential new resource in the field. it presents twenty recent papers by leading specialists that illustrate the abiding power of behavioral finance--of how specific departures from fully rational decision making by individual market agents can provide explanations of otherwise puzzling market phenomena. as with the first volume, it reaches beyond the world of finance to suggest, powerfully, the importance of pursuing behavioral approaches to other areas of economic life. the contributors are brad m. barber, nicholas barberis, shlomo benartzi, john y. campbell, emil m. dabora, daniel kent, françois degeorge, kenneth a. froot, j. b. heaton, david hirshleifer, harrison hong, ming huang, narasimhan jegadeesh, josef lakonishok, owen a. lamont, roni michaely, terrance odean, jayendu patel, tano santos, andrei shleifer, robert j. shiller, jeremy c. stein, avanidhar subrahmanyam, richard h. thaler, sheridan titman, robert w. vishny, kent l. womack, and richard zeckhauser. © 2005 by russell sage foundation. all rights reserved."
"from views of hominine bounded rationalities, this paper argues the relationship between ordinal strategic risk and return with behavioral finance. focusing on a different interest, this paper adopts a new conceptualization of risk and shows how this conceptualization leads to a new measure of strategic risk, based upon mental accounts and ordinal approach. a behavioral finance model is presented, in which strategic reference and risk attitudes are endogenously determined and influence risk-return performance. with the model, this paper tests the bowman's risk-return paradox. the selected sample consists of 18 companies listed on the shse 50 stock market index. results indicate that risk-seeking companies can strategically achieve sustainable high returns at low risk. we discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of strategic risk based on the behavioral finance theories. © 2005 ieee."
"this paper describes preliminary results of the puget sound region's traffic choices study, a demand pricing project in a large metropolitan region that combines a physical experiment with 500 volunteer vehicles in a controlled research environment, an existing off-the shelf gps and gsm based in-vehicle and central system tolling solution, with an extensive analytical design that examines behavioral responses to road pricing. the project combines, in a unique way, a test of technology, public behavior and attitudes, with the collection of large-scale price response data for use in other analytical efforts. the long-term goal of the project is to provide objective and encompassing data to investigate and refine policy issues and questions regarding the future of demand pricing, laying the groundwork for one future finance option for investments in the puget sound region's roadway network. a significant and unique aspect of this project is that it represents the first time that a facility-based toll system encompasses an entire region, covering arterial as well as freeway facilities."
"bsv (barberis, shleifer and vishny [journal of financial economics 49 (1998) 307-343]) model is one of the three major behavioral finance models. the existing bsv model is about how behavioral investors form beliefs, and is able to produce both overre-action and mean-reversion for a wide range of parameter values. however, the assumption that all investors in the market must all be bsv investors is a little strict and remains controversial. in this paper, we present an agent-based computational model of the dynamic game between bsv investors and rational investors. time series from the artificial stock market are analyzed and two interesting findings are reported. first, the introduction of rational investors will not eliminate the anomalies of overreaction and mean-reversion. second, no evidence is found that the bsv investors will lose money to their counterparts although their cognitive bias makes them form a false kind of expectation. on the contrary, some weak evidence is reported that bsv investors are less likely to bankrupt. © world scientific publishing company."
"this paper utilizes path analysis, an approach common in behavioral and natural science literatures but relatively unseen in finance and accounting, to improve inferences drawn from a combined database of financial and non-financial information. focusing on the revenue generating activities of internet firms, this paper extends the literature on internet valuation while addressing the potentially endogenous and multicollinear nature of the internet activity measures applied in their tests. results suggest that both sg&a and r&d have significant explanatory power over the web activity measures, suggestive that these expenditures represent investments in product quality. evidence from the path analysis also indicates that both accounting and nonfinancial measures, in particular sg&a and pageviews, are significantly associated with firm revenues. finally, this paper suggests other areas of accounting research which could benefit from a path analysis approach. © 2005 by world scientific publishing co. pte. ltd. and cheng-few lee. © 2005 by world scientific publishing co. pte. ltd. and cheng-few lee."
"the question of why individual investors want dividends is investigated by submitting a questionnaire to a dutch investor panel. the respondents indicate that they want dividends partly because the cost of cashing in dividends is lower than the cost of selling shares. their answers provide strong confirmation for the signaling theories of bhattacharya (1979) [bhattacharya, s., 1979. imperfect information, dividend policy and the ""bird in the hand"" fallacy. bell journal of economics 10, 259-270] and miller and rock (1985) [miller, m., modigliani, f., 1961. dividend policy, growth and the valuation of shares. journal of business 34, 411-433]. they are inconsistent with the uncertainty resolution theory of gordon (1961, 1962) [gordon, m., 1961. the investment, financing, and valuation of the corporation, richard d. irwin, homewood, il; gordon, m., 1962. the savings, investment and valuation of a corporation. review of economics and statistics 44, 37-51.] and the agency theories of jensen (1986) [jensen, m.c., 1986. agency costs of free cash flow, corporate finance and takeovers. american economic review 76, 323-329] and easterbrook (1984) [easterbrook, f.h., 1984. two agency-cost explanations of dividends. american economic review 74, 650-659]. the behavioral finance theory of shefrin and statman (1984) [shefrin, h.m., statman, m., 1984. explaining investor preference for cash dividends. journal of financial economics 13, 253-282] is not confirmed for cash dividends but is confirmed for stock dividends. finally, our results indicate that individual investors do not tend to consume a large part of their dividends. this raises some doubt as to whether a reduction or elimination of dividend taxes will stimulate the economy. © 2005 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved."
"just like the market which has its bulls and its bears, investments has its fundamentalists crowd and its technicians crowd. the academic finance profession must wake up and realize that investing is no longer driven solely by fundamental and statistical analysis. while as a pro fes s ion we believe in and teach the fundamental investment subj ects such as capm or emh, we also realize the need to examine ways to explain the 80% of the variability of stock returns not explained by the fundamentals. in addition to the fundamental investment subjects an increased exposure to both behavioral finance and the psychology of financial markets is absolutely necessary to increase the understanding of how and why stocks move. just as the bulls need the bears, fundamentalists need technicians. behavioral finance, crowd psychology, and the psychology of financial markets are the underpinnings of technical analysis. western technical analysis predates capm and emh by decades, if not more, tracing its roots back to charles dow founder of dow jones. © emerald group publishing limited 2005."

"the purpose of this research was to identify the mentoring and executive competencies required among preceptors of the army-baylor university graduate program in health and business administration, and to specify the requisite skills, knowledge, and abilities (skas) needed to achieve those competencies. in the first wave of inquiry, a list of 123 competencies and associated skas was elicited from a network of 80 current and past preceptor executives employing a delphi methodology using e-mail. an expert panel, which consisted of seven past program directors, examined and sorted the list into four preceptor content domains, viz., health systems management (hs management), leadership, residency administration, and community involvement. frequency analyses showed that the hs management domain constituted over half of the competencies, with particular emphasis on strategic thinking, planning, billing, finance, manpower, and contracting. in the second wave, the preceptor delphi network reviewed the expertpanel list and made 7-pointska importance ratings on an 80-item structured questionnaire representative of the four domains. findings indicated thataverage ska ratings were reliable and agreed upon to a high degree among preceptors. results, rank ordered by ska item means within preceptor content domains and overall, suggested that the most important rated items centered on teamwork, negotiation, interpersonal skills, communication, leadership vision, and customer and healthcare business operations. outcomes from the competency list are expected to be useful for preceptor mentoring, self-assessment, and for professional development. additionally, specific skas can provide a means for developing job requirements and career performance criteria at a behavioral task level, and can contribute information for identifying continuing education and conference topical needs."

"the patient's role in adequacy of hemodialysis is demanding and complex. it requires meticulous attention to initiating, accepting, and maintaining extraordinary behavioral change. this includes the following: (1) major alteration of dietary habits, often contrary to a patient's familial and cultural customs; (2) compliance with a new, voluminous medication routine, often straining personal finances; (3) reallocation of time for transportation, treatment, and partial recovery, frequently consuming a minimum of 6 to 8 hours 3 days each week; (4) psychologic adjustment to unaccustomed chronic dependency on, and accountability to, an array of variably experienced and competent renal care staff; (5) skills, seldom taught, required to communicate clearly and regularly with overworked medical professionals who are often much younger with less life experience; and (6) additional commitment to compensating for the physical fatigue that routinely accompanies hemodialysis. reasonable behavioral modification in these 6 categories is likely to increase the chances of a patient fulfilling his role in adequacy of dialysis. some patients, however committed the staff have been in assisting them, may show little interest in dialysis adequacy and the patient's role. other patients periodically may fail in their role unless the renal care team recognizes the patient as an individual who is included as an important team member. the patient requires consistent and repeated education about their disease, treatment, and risks and benefits of adherence. the unique, unnatural requirements of adequate chronic hemodialysis require this patient support from the renal staff, enhanced by continuous sensitive attention, empathy, and persuasion. this will help the patient achieve success in their role. © 2005 elsevier inc. all rights reserved."

"most capital market regulation is expressly or implicitly based on a theory of how the regulated market works. that is, the regulation requires actor a to take action x or prohibits a from taking action y - all with the purpose of getting the market to do m or preventing the market from doing n. such regulation rests, explicitly or by implication, on some theory that connects the actions x or y - by actor a - with market reactions m and n. in the united states, the efficient capital market hypothesis is the basis for most regulation. the behavioral finance's approach can be integrated into the same framework of law and economics, of which it constitutes an improvement capable of explaining the failure of the emch in some marginal cases. except in short periods like the high-tech bubble, however, behavioral finance may only explain the actions of certain investors, such as individuals, and not the actions of the market as a whole. in the united states, arbitrageurs will overcome psychologically based trading in most cases. the efficient capital market hypothesis is an economic model, which assumes that the market is comprised of a large number of rational participants and that information is fully and quickly available to them. in the u.s. and the u.k., the elements of an efficient market can generally be traced. in turn, information is provided to the market by corporate insiders. thus, a risk exists that it be limited, inaccurate, or fraudulent. as a general matter, ""corporate governance"" refers to an important legal relationship that exists between managers, auditors and the board of directors. in the united states, the company's management governs the company under the supervision of the board of directors and for the benefit of its shareholders. auditors ensure that the management complies with accounting standards, thereby providing shareholders and prospective investors with an accurate understanding of the company's financial health. two factors played an important role in leading to the corporate scandals of the early 2000's: a) auditors' misperception that their responsibilities was to serve the management, and b) the need for ceos and cfos to ensure that financial information (particularly referred to quarterly and annually financial disclosures) be accurate. this paper argues that the ecmh still provides (some 40 years after its widespread dissemination) the theory of how markets work, which is the most useful theory for regulators in the united states."
